Pushpesh Pant,"Swami Vivekananda ranks among the highest in the pantheon of distinguished children of Mother India. His charismatic personality electrified audiences, and his organisational skills were unmatched. His influence on other freedom fighters – from Yogi Aurobindo to Netaji Subhas C Bose – is just as incomparable. It was not only fellow Indians who came under Vivekananda’s spell. He was arguably the first and most successful brand ambassador of a resurgent India in the USA, spreading his teaching far and wide. Vivekananda strove to combat superstition, to get rid of the deadwood of ritual that was  stifling those who followed the Hindu way of life, and left behind a large body of written work, reinterpreting the Vedanta for modern times. Vivekananda’s ways were unorthodox. The cigar-smoking monk had no problem with those who ate meat. He freely borrowed from whatever he felt was the best practice in other religions. His favourite word was ‘strength’ – he exhorted fellow Indians to be strong in body and spirit. He was compassionate and liberal in his outlook. For him, there was no religion greater than serving the wretched – the poor, the ailing, and the oppressed. The ochre robes of a Hindu monk have become a red rag for these scholars who bore the heavy  . Vivekananda became a symbol of what was termed   strident and aggressive. They failed to see that Vivekananda continued to mesmerise the young and old across the length and breadth of India, long after his death. Calendar art bears testimony to this – the undisputed Trimurti of Swami Vivekananda, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Bose continue to adorn the walls of many homes even today. Those who are agitated today about the appropriation of Vivekananda by the Sangh Parivar and are desperate to reclaim him, must ask themselves this question – why and how had they remained blind to the multifaceted contributions of this exceptional Indian? Today the Congress and other parties in opposition are desperately trying to get a foothold in the hearts and minds of voters who proudly proclaim their adherence to ‘Sanatana Dharma’. Simultaneously, strategists are working overtime on how best to market ‘Soft Hinduism’ to counter the machinations of the Hindutva Brigade. In the short term, this opportunism may bring some dividends, but it is bound to eventually boomerang. The  believed in service before self, and couldn’t stand hypocrisy. He examined the past with ruthless detachment and tested everything with razor-sharp intelligence. He was indeed a pioneering moderniser. At the same time, one can not surgically separate the social reformer from the spiritual seeker. Like Adi Shankaracharya, whose life and outlook Vivekananda seemed to have mirrored in many ways – the disciple of the mystic Ramkrishna  had something to offer to each person. Swami Vivekananda preached not only   (selfless action) but also emphasized the ethos of   and   (devotion and intellectual quest). This apart, Vivekananda had an impish sense of humour, and would have surely been very amused by the bickering among his blind followers, and detractors. It would be foolish to suggest or believe that he can be owned and monopolised by any partisan / sectarian group. Indians and foreigners alike will continue to be enriched by his teachings, and Vivekananda will remain a living presence above political skirmishes. Therefore, apprehensions about the misappropriation of Vivekananda are totally misplaced. One doesn’t even have to be a believer – far less a Hindu – to admire Vivekananda, and acknowledge his seminal contribution to the making of modern India.

Meeran Chadha Borwankar,"In the news for the wrong reasons, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of late has been attracting public attention for the misdemeanor of it past directors, and more recently, due to the alleged discord between its director and special director that has culminated into Alok Verma tendering his resignation after much political and legal hullabaloo.  It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors – Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh – to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 – are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to ‘accommodate’ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted – they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI – directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBI’s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as ‘caged parrot’ and ‘His master’s voice’. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation – some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances – 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors – as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high – more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the ‘service of the people’ and NOT for ‘the service of the party in power’.

Mayukh Ghosh,"Reminiscing about the past is a dreadful tool that filmmakers often use to bring out a certain empathy for a character stuck in a specific time period. But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali household’s kitchen. I had seen   only too often — working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Sen’s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a ‘film within a film’ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens — understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class family’s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the family’s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started ‘shouting out his own politics’ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Sen’s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy – both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used ‘juxtaposition’ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Sen’s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramani’s presence and his sensibilities — Sen’s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the ‘master’ smiles at his ‘other self’, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all — the ‘cut’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Akanksha Kumar,": Akanksha Kumar : Sandeep Suman Twenty-three years later as former Delhi Police Joint Commissioner Maxwell Pereira recalled his experience of leading the probe into the murder of Naina Sahni, a case that shocked the entire country, he didn’t seem to have any regret for his strong comments. On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victim’s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasn’t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharma’s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma can’t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, “he regrets his action”. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that “a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years”. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough “unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence”. According to Maxwell Pereira, “the police had done its job and now it’s up to the institutions who take decisions on such matters”. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. ‘He left the police service’, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Poonam Agarwal,"As many as 92 witnesses in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case turned hostile during cross-examination in the court.  has exclusively accessed the list of 30 prosecution witnesses who turned hostile while they were crossed examined before the CBI court in Mumbai. On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case. Among these, five of their statements were recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, while others had theirs recorded by the investigating agency. Below are details of the testimony/statements of 13 crucial witnesses: , the sister of Kalimuddin, an associate of Sohrabuddin, had stated to the investigating agency that her brother hosted Sohrabuddin and his wife in Hyderabad in mid-November 2005. It is from their house that Sohrabuddin and his wife left for Sangli. Kalimuddin was also wanted in several criminal cases by the Andhra Pradesh Police. But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleema’s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabad’s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were “taken by the investigating agency under duress.” He also charged the CBI with “acting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.” In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solanki’s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Indira Basu,"Ahead of the Rajasthan assembly elections on 7 December, the Congress party’s state President Sachin Pilot, spoke to  . In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Kingshuk Nag,"In February 2015, barely months after ascending the throne, KCR’s cops were able to catch a TDP MLA red-handed trying to bribe an independent MLA to vote in favour of the party in the (then forthcoming) legislative council election. Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naidu’s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCR’s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCR’s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. “Hyderabad is a boom town now,” is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naidu’s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assembly’s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia — who he said was like his own ‘mother’ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if ‘he was given a free hand.’ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the ‘Modi magic’ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that “People are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.” KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPM’s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Kota Neelima,"Rural Telangana, where almost 62 percent of the population lives, had played a crucial role in the formation of the new state in 2014. As the Legislative Assembly goes to polls on 7 December, narratives of families of farmer suicides in the prosperous Nalgonda district, highlight how little their life has changed. Nalgonda has the highest number of farmer suicides, according to data available since the state’s formation. Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telangana’s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiah’s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiah’s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiah’s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husband’s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme ‘Aarogyasri’ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radha’s only other option is agriculture. “I must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,” she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  ‘ ’ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Arushi Vats,"A recent finding of 27,000 documents throws light on the only liberal party India has ever had, allowing us to probe its contribution to Indian politics in the 15 years of its existence. Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of India’s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: “I write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.” A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroy’s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 – Swatantra's founding year – the note states, “It was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...” The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajaji’s response to the rise of what he saw as the ‘one-footed’ democracy—a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajaji’s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congress’ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued “democracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.” No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of India’s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajaji’s demise in 1974 – only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

Aishwarya S Iyer,"Mohd Irshad Alam Not only did Manvendra Singh quit the BJP and join the Congress party ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly elections, but is now also contesting against sitting BJP Chief Minister Vasudhara Raje.  met him in Rajasthan’s Jhalawar district, where he stands from Jhalrapatan constituency, a seat that Raje has won for three consecutive terms. He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singh’s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who has  a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

The Quint,"Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the VVIP chopper scam and UK national, was extradited to India from UAE in the wee hours of Wednesday, 5 December. But just a few months ago, Michel had reportedly gone missing. Michel’s lawyer, Amal Alsubei had told   that Michel had gone missing from the day UAE went to the court. Alsubei also added that the middleman in the Rs 3,600 crore deal will be arrested when found, and that he is likely to appeal in Supreme Court. According to the reports, on 26 August, UAE had asked a court on the possibility of extraditing a British national, not specifically Michel, to a third country,   reported. The reports of Michel going missing came a day after reports of a UAE court ordering extradition of the middleman to India surfaced. Michel was arrested in the UAE in 2017 and was out on bail then. At the time of the Rs 3,600-crore scam (early 2013), Christian Michel was a well-known British consultant who was very active in the Indian defence sector. It was alleged that he was hired by AgustaWestland to facilitate the deal for the supply of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. Michel is one of the three middlemen being probed in the case, besides Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, by the ED and CBI. The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen ""managed to"" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through “criminal activity” and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

Smitha TK,"Ashutosh Bharadwaj Smitha TK The race to win the Telangana throne is getting more thrilling as election day approaches. As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesn’t repeat any of these mistakes. “This time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now – Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS – we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,” said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. “He promised something and didn’t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,” he added. He alleged that the chief minister’s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the state’s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to women’s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister – but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. “I have no such ambitions. My limited role is to lead the Congress party this election. And I think I will do that successfully. The next step is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi,” he said.

Sanjiv Krishan Sood,"The Border Security Force, the largest border guarding force in the world, celebrated its 54th Raising day on 1 December. Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a “section” which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of “platoon”. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours – sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now – both internal and external – is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt “smart border management” practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and “Ek goli ek dushman” type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of “integrated check posts” and “land custom stations” to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

Navjot Singh Sidhu had also clarified on Friday, 30 November, that he didn't go there on the instructions of his party Chief Rahul Gandhi. “The whole world knows I went on PM Imran Khan’s personal invite,” he wrote on Twitter: Earlier, on Sunday, 2 December, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu had clarified that he did not mean any disrespect to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh. According to ANI, Navjot Kaur Sidhu also asserted that her husband’s statement “should be read as a whole and not in incomplete bits.” In the day, Sidhu had triggered the controversy when he said that Gandhi had sent him to Pakistan for attending the inauguration ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor and that the Congress president was his ""captain.” On Friday, to a query at a news conference, Sidhu had said, ""Rahul Gandhi is my captain. It is he who sent me to Pakistan. Rahul Gandhi is the also the captain of the Captain (Amarinder),"" Sidhu told a press conference in Hyderabad when asked about Singh's disapproval of his Pakistan trip.

Replying to a question about Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's remark that Prime Minister Imran Khan's ""googly"" had compelled India to send two Union ministers for the Kartarpur event, Sidhu said, ""How do you bowl a googly to a batsman. I have never left such a ball."" ""When 10,000 people are taking selfies with you, how do you know who is Chawla? How? This is absolute rubbish. The last time when I went to Pakistan, I was sitting with someone who was again controversial,” Sidhu said. ""Am I supposed to see where I sit.

Amandeep Sandhu,"Keeping his promise, Pakistan premier Imran Khan on Wednesday, 28 November, performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the proposed Kartarpur Sahib corridor. On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.” Since Marx’s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other – all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : “ ” entres of religion, from which we have been separated.” For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a ‘traitor’. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made ‘hate Pakistan’ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: “ ” “If you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.” It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we – both nations – want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razor’s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The News Minute,"Telangana caretaker IT Minister KT Rama Rao on Thursday, 29 November, lashed out at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo N Chandrababu Naidu and questioned his decision to give Nandamuri Suhasini, the granddaughter of former CM NT Rama Rao, a ‘losing’ ticket like Kukatpally for the upcoming polls in the state. Continuing to take a jibe at Naidu, KTR asked if the TDP chief would have made Lokesh contest from Kukatpally. “He did not, because he knows that Kukatpally is a losing seat. Naidu wants to make Suhasini a scapegoat and later wants to restrict her brothers (Jr NTR and Nandamuri Kalyan Ram) from entering into politics,” he said. The TDP has fielded Nandamuri Suhasini as the constituency also has several voters who have their roots in the state neighbouring Telangana and have settled in the city. Suhasini is the candidate for the People’s Front alliance comprising the Congress, TDP, Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and CPI. KTR also said that the TRS had been in an alliance with the TDP in the past only because the latter assured support for the separate state of Telangana. “Naidu is asking why he is being criticised.

David Devadas,"The Centre is in a stew over the recent fiasco regarding government formation in Jammu and Kashmir. Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malik’s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose People’s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governor’s rule in J&K, during which the state’s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Lone’s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJP’s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the state’s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an ‘unholy alliance’. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group. The three parties had come together after initial discussions at a meeting in London. The idea gathered steam even though NC leader Omar Abdullah was initially unhappy. Naturally! His party is set to gain from the general disappointment with the PDP’s governance in Kashmir. No wonder Omar has called for fresh elections since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led government in July.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The News Minute,"BJP State President, P Sreedharan Pillai on Friday, 30 November, said that the party will strengthen its stand on the Sabarimala issue by beginning a protest outside the Kerala Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram from Monday onwards. The protest, which will go on for two weeks will see party members from each of the 14 districts coming to the Secretariat to protest each day. Some of the demands that BJP will be putting forth during the protest will include lifting of restrictions in Sabarimala and strict action against the police officers for allegedly foisting false case on K Surendran, the general secretary of the party. The BJP state president said that the decision to shift the protest from Sabarimala to the Secretariat comes after women between ages 10 and 50 have stopped attempting to enter the shrine. “Only if women between these ages try to enter the temple, will we begin protesting at Sabarimala again. Now that some of the restrictions are lifted, we will receive backlash from the devotees (if protests inconvenience them),” said Sreedharan Pillai. Reacting to this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that he welcomes the BJP’s decision to shift their protests to the Secretariat. “This decision by the BJP shows they have understood that the people have started to grasp the stand of the state government regarding the Sabarimala issue,” said Pinarayi Vijayan. “It is not possible to stand straight if you take a stand that is not acceptable by the society,” said the CM. Pinarayi Vijayan also stated that the cases filed against the BJP leaders were not because of the stand taken by the state government. “All of this is a part of implementing the law.

Neeraj Gupta,"According to latest figures of electoral bonds that have surfaced, out of the bonds worth Rs 222 crore between 1 March to 10 March 2018, Rs 210 crore’s worth of donations have been given to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is 95 percent of the total bonds. Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here? Here’s a little philosophy around electoral bonds: On 1 February 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that the donations received by political parties henceforth will not be in cash, but in the form of electoral bonds. However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power. This is the very basis of the corruption that takes place in government. An   by  ’s Poonam Agarwal revealed that electoral bonds have a hidden alphanumeric code printed on them to track down the link between donors and political parties. This apparent manoeuvring by the government poses a critical question – in the name of increased ‘transparency’ in political funding with the introduction of electoral bonds, are we being subjected to unprecedented levels of secret surveillance? Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. ’s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye. This adds to the government’s already burgeoning repository of data, which now may not only have details of our bank accounts and financial transactions, but also our likely political preferences.

Khan, Transport and PWD Minister in the Vasundhara Raje government, has been fielded by the BJP in the Muslim-dominated Tonk assembly constituency, replacing the party's sitting MLA Ajit Singh Mehta after the Congress gave a ticket to Pilot in Tonk. Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: ""I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s.""

Asked if Tonk having a large number of Muslims was one of the reasons behind his candidature, the BJP leader said the election here will be on the basis of performance and agenda. ""The election will be on who can serve Tonk better. I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.”, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk. Pitching himself as an underdog in the high-stakes electoral battle, Khan took a swipe at his Congress rival and said, ""He (Pilot) has come for the first time, I have been a minister for long...I know the workers here.""

Talking to PTI, he acknowledged both he and Pilot were outsiders in Tonk, but there was one difference – ""through the power that I had in my pen (as a minister), I have given roads worth Rs 2,000 crore."" On the Congress' charge that Khan's ticket was cut from Deedwana and was finally given one from Tonk because of his religion, he said the opposition party gives statements according to its convenience.

Poonam Agarwal,"Paytm’s owner, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, and his brother Ajay Shekhar Sharma are alleging data theft and extortion in a case that gets murkier as more details come out.  has been uncovering the various sides of the case, and has now got confirmation of a key piece of the puzzle – what is the nature of the data that was stolen? An FIR was registered by Noida Police on 22 October on the complaint of data theft and extortion by the owner of PayTm, Vijay Shekhar Sharma and his brother Ajay Shekhar Sharma. It alleged that four people tried to extort Rs 10 crore from Paytm’s owner against the stolen data. The alleged blackmailers also threatened to make the data public and defame Vijay Shekhar Sharma if ransom was not paid. The FIR named four persons as accused – Sonia Dhawan, an employee of Paytm and personal secretary of Vijay; Roopak Jain, Sonia’s husband; Devinder Kumar, Paytm employee; and Rohit Chomwal, a businessman from Kolkata. The FIR doesn’t reveal the nature of the data stolen nor has Sharma commented on the nature the data. A lot of assumptions and speculation came out in the media that the data could be related to Paytm users’ personal details, which could be misused or sold by the alleged blackmailers.  has finally got answers to what is in the stolen data. Dr Ajay Pal Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar district has confirmed to  that the stolen data is related to Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s personal life. A reliable source has confirmed that the personal data was allegedly stolen by Devindra Kumar, one of the accused in the case. Noida Police has claimed that a CD was recovered from one of the accused which allegedly contains stolen data. The CD has been sent for Forensic examination. The FIR accessed by  reveals that Chomwal was a key player. He was directly communicating with Vijay and Ajay through WhatsApp calls and messages. The FIR says, It was he who demanded Rs 10 crore as ransom and also informed the complainants about his other accomplices. Sonia’s lawyer refused to divulge the details of the data as the matter is subjudice. A small part of the ransom money was transferred into Chomwal’s bank account in two tranches, Rs 67 and Rs 2 lakhs, on 10 and 15 October, respectively. Interestingly, the key player, Chomwal, is still at large and he has not been questioned by the police even once. Meanwhile, Sonia, Roopak and Devinder were arrested and are still in jail. Sonia’s bail application will come up for hearing on 4 December. In November 2018, Chomwal moved an application in the Allahabad High Court which gave him protection from being arrested till the investigation is completed. The   in   possession alleges that Chomwal has been wrongly accused in the case and has been made an “escape goat” (sic) especially when the petitioner (ie: Chomwal) helped Vijay Shekhar and his brother in apprehending the three ‘culprits’. The police has not clarified what evidence they have against Sonia, Roopak and Devinder to prove their involvement in the case. Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court? The FIR reveals that the first ransom call was made by Chomwal on 20 September but the complaint was filed on 22 October. Why did the complainant wait for 32 days to file a complaint? Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwal’s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwal’s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Sonia’s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office. The question then is – why was she allowed to come to office when Vijay knew that she was one of the persons blackmailing him? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Vikrant Dubey ," Mohd Ibrahim Fabeha Syed Sadhus of Ayodhya have expressed their disappointment over the ‘Dharm-Sabha’ organised by the VHP on 25 November in Ayodhya. They accuse BJP of not doing enough for the construction of Ram Mandir. Most sadhus and priests of Ayodhya distanced themselves from the ‘sabha’. They said that they were not invited to the event because they are speaking out vociferously on the temple issue, and the BJP does not like that. Priests feel that the BJP likes to consult religious leaders so it can keep the issue of Ram Mandir burning just to maintain a hold on the larger public sentiment. One of the priests also threatened to end his life if the construction date of Ram Mandir is not announced soon. People of Ayodhya also complained that they feel the Ram Mandir issue will not be getting resolved anytime soon. Some of the locals who   spoke to, said that the BJP always promised constructing the Ram Temple on the condition that they are elected to power, but when they win, nothing happens.

Abhipsha Mahapatro,"There’s an agrarian crisis gripping our country and pushing the hands that feed us to commit suicide, says senior journalist P Sainath. There has never been an urgent need to address this crisis more than now, and the hundreds of country’s farmers want the parliamentarians to listen, he points out. Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). “The message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why can’t one be called for the farmers’ issues,” he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says. Sainath has been mobilising support for the farmers' march to Delhi, which has been organised in collaboration with over 200 farmers’ outfits. Hundreds of farmers from different locations marched to Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, 29 November. On Friday, 30 November, the farmers will walk from Ramlila Maidan to the Parliament Street to demand a Joint Session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis.

Rakesh Dubbudu,"The Electoral Bonds were first announced in the 2017-18 budget and the scheme was subsequently   in January 2018.   had   about the bonds, their impact on transparency etc. It was also anticipated that the ruling party at the center would be the biggest beneficiary of these anonymous donations. Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJP’s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  . This would further increase in 2017-18 because of the anonymous nature of electoral bonds. None of the national or state parties that have   their annual audit report for 2017-18 have declared any income from electoral bonds. It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date. Even in terms of the number of bonds purchased, 1678 out of the 1795 or 93.5 percent electoral bonds purchased till date are in the denomination of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Though there is no concrete information on the type of purchasers since SBI has refused to share such information, it is highly likely that the Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore denomination are purchased by corporates than individuals.

Sidhu, however, dismissed the reports and said that he does not know who is Gopal Chawla. “There were probably 10,000 pictures taken of and with me (in Pakistan), I don't know who Gopal Chawla is,” Sidhu told news agency ANI after returning to India. The controversy comes months after Sidhu was criticised for embracing Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa while the Punjab minister was attending the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Chawla, who heads the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, is a prominent pro-Khalistan voice. Earlier this month, he had provoked anger in India after he allegedly stopped Indian officials from visiting a gurudwara in Lahore to meet Sikh pilgrims from India. Chawla was a vocal propagator of ' ' that calls for the “liberation of Punjab.” Speaking to  , Security Analyst Praveen Swami said, “Chawla’s name had cropped up during the investigation of the grenade attack on the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, but there is no hard evidence against him.” Chawla is vocal about his pro-Khalistani stand on social media, and in a Facebook video, he can be heard saying, “Bharat is not Bharat, it has become Hindustan, which is why we need Khalistan.” He goes to praise Pakistan and raise anti-India slogans. Defending himself, Chawla told  Chawla also added that he clicked pictures with almost everybody present at the event. However, on being asked about the “terror activites” in Punjab, Chawla said, “We don’t support terror. Punjab is ours and why would we create disturbance in our own home?” On the sidelines of the ground-breaking ceremony, Chawla also met the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) President Gobind Singh Longowal. Speaking to the media, former Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “If Sidhu shakes hands with Gopal Chawla, who was involved in a terror attack in Pakistan, then he'll have to answer for it.” Badal also said that Sidhu doesn’t care about any protocol and that he should remember that the general he shook hands with “makes the youth of his country fight and die everyday.” Meanwhile, a Pakistani official clarified that the Pakistani Army Chief met all the guests at the Kartarpur ceremony venue and that the Indian media was taking a “myopic view” of the picture. The BJP, too, reacted sharply to Chawla's photo with Sidhu.

Tridivesh Singh Maini,"Tensions between cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu and Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh came to the fore, when the latter, in an interview to a TV channel stated, that he had advised Sidhu to   his decision to attend the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Corridor on 28 November 2018, in Pakistan. Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhu’s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithia’s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahi’s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980’s, the Elahi’s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani ‘Deep State’. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singh’s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singh’s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

A K Singh,"The pristine Andaman and Nicobar islands lie in splendid isolation over 750 kms in the Bay of Bengal, and have a chequered history. After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Avi Singh,"The recent demand, forcefully made by the RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, for a law or ordinance on the Ram temple, pushes a false binary – between a judicial decision and an ordinance or act. This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular – assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament – will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities –which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable – the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed “to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque”, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute – a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latter’s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest – not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence – a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary – including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on ‘2-3’ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November – and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSS’s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

Nishtha Gautam,"“My book doesn’t seek to say that this person or this dispensation ruined everything because, frankly, everyone is collectively responsible for the rural distress there is today in the country.” “I’m a member of the Parliament and I decided long back not to draw a parliamentary salary. I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughter’s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because that’s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. That’s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.” “You always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. That’s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesn’t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?” “When Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.” “It’s not about the government only. It’s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there it’s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. “These are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that don’t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, “ ” But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.” “When talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they can’t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylinders—which are made from crude oil—spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday. If we can build localised gobar gas plants in every village and connect them to every house we’d have increased electricity, the tyranny of distance would be less and it would be cheaper. And those animals would always be relevant and therefore lead the life of some dignity.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Siddharth Chatterjee ,"‘Do not let us off the hook; keep our feet to the fire’. These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of ‘16 Days of Activism’ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UN’s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this year’s ‘16 Days of Activism’ – ‘Orange the World; Hear Me Too’. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a woman’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced India’s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, women’s rights are being “reduced, restricted and reversed”, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. ’s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Mithun MK,"Two days after she went missing from her residence on Tuesday morning, Chandramukhi Muvvala, a well-known trans activist who is contesting the Telangana polls from Goshamahal, was found on Wednesday night. This came a day after Chandramukhi’s mother, Anitha Muvvala, represented by lawyer Vasudha Nagraj, filed a habeas corpus writ petition in the Hyderabad High Court. Admitting the petition, the court had asked the Jubilee Hills police to produce Chandramukhi before them by 10:15 am on Thursday. Chandramukhi had reportedly been missing since 8:25 am on Tuesday, 27 November; based on the missing person's complaint, an FIR has been filed. The police said that they are reviewing CCTV footage. According to sources, Chandramukhi turned up at the Banjara Hills police station along with her lawyer and some activists late on Wednesday night. Speaking to TNM, Anitha confirmed that Chandramukhi had been found and was doing okay. She is expected to be produced at the court at 10 am. ""She has come back. She was abducted by someone and intimidated severely, she's dazed and disoriented. She'll share what happened to her before the court,"" Vasudha Nagaraj, her lawyer, told TNM. “She was noticed missing since 8:25 am and the door of her house is locked from the outside,” the Banjara Hills SHO said. Chandramukhi, a well-known face in Hyderabad’s trans community, is contesting from the Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad on a Bahujan Left Front (BLF) ticket. She will be taking on bigwigs such as the BJP’s Raja Singh and the Congress’ Mukesh Goud. Vinu, who is tasked with the campaign schedule, told the press that Chandramukhi would inform him where she was going, and who she is meeting. “We approached the police only at 2:30 pm. We waited, hoping she would come back by then,” he said. Vinu also alleged that a person who was found lurking around her house in the CCTV footage could be involved in her disappearance. Anitha Muvvala, Chandramukhi’s mother, said that she last spoke to her daughter between 8 and 9 pm on Monday, 26 November. ""We fear for her safety and condemn the lack of safety measures for her and for other women and transgender candidates, which acts as a strong force that dissuades transgender persons and women from joining politics.

Sanjana Ray,"Mizoram’s BJP President, John V Hluna expressed his unhappiness with the lack of importance given to the state by the party’s central leadership. Hluna also flagged BJP's 'Hindutva' image as a big liability. In a candid interview with  , which was published on the day the state went to polls, on Wednesday, 28 November, Hluna said that from Modi to Shah, no national BJP leader had put in the slightest effort in the pre-election campaign. He also said that they didn’t give the state enough importance. Adding to this, he said, the biggest problem the party faced in the state, was carrying the tag of  . According to Hluna, people in Mizoram – a predominantly Christian state – have in the past opposed the BJP, as they believe that the party would persecute Christians, should they be voted to power, the  report read. Despite this, Hluna told the news agency that he was fairly confident of the BJP bagging the highest number of seats in the Assembly elections, voting for which began on Wednesday, 28 November. He said the people wanted change and development, which the BJP could give them, the report added. Hluna told the news agency that he didn’t think that Modi, Shah and the party’s other central leaders had made enough of an effort for the pre-election campaign in Mizoram, as they had only sent one lawmaker and not visited any constituency themselves. He further said that since Hindi or English isn’t the first language of the Mizo people, the party’s central leadership did not have that much effect on them. Another point he brought up, was the lack of funds and lack of power that the state party was being given by its central leadership. “They should give us more money so that we can run things on our own. But there is no money, we are very poor. If there is a lot of money, we can do well,” he told  . To Hluna, the BJP’s greatest challenge to coming into power, was being perceived as a pro-Hindutva outfit, which would persecute those belonging to the Christian faith, the report stated. However, he added that it would be a Christian BJP candidate from Mizoram, who would come to power, if the BJP won the elections. Hence, he said, this is why people shouldn’t think against voting for the BJP, the report stated. Despite his problem with the central leadership of the BJP and the party’s “Hindutva” image in the state, Hluna told  that he was fairly confident and optimistic about its win in the elections. The reason, he said, was because people were fed up with the Congress rule under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla and that they wanted change and development- which the state party under Narendra Modi’s guidance, would be able to give them. He also said that if the Congress, MNF and other parties were unable to form the new government independently, he was confident that their lawmakers would join the BJP, which, he claimed, would win the maximum seats in the elections, the report said.

As the nation heads into the next general election in six months, Modi may face a united opposition. And market experts are keenly watching the ongoing state elections as the results may offer a glimpse of what 2019 could throw up.

T M Veeraraghav,"Over the last year, Telangana Chief Minister and TRS Chief K Chandrashekar Rao has been seen as warming up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Prime Minster Narendra Modi. He had supported the idea of joint polls before suddenly declaring early polls in Telangana and, as recently as August 2018, KCR had sent out indications that he is even open to a possible post-poll tie up with the BJP. But there seems to be a twist in that “friendly” tale with the BJP, and in the last three days, the Telangana campaign has been dominated by an acerbic  , in an exchange of statements and allegations. Hitting back at Modi, KCR, speaking at a rally in Mahbubnagar, alleged that the prime minister was “spreading lies for votes” and even referred to him as a “foolish” prime minister. He further stated that he was “not scared” of the prime minister like his political rivals. Firstly, KCR’s principal rival in the state is the Congress party and hence it is necessary for him to have a cordial equation with the BJP. Further, Telangana as a newly-formed state is heavily dependent on the Centre and hence, he needs a good equation with the prime minister. This population is not just centred around Hyderabad city where it even has a majority in some assembly seats, but is spread across the state and can be decisive in districts like Nizamabad or even KCR’s bastion Mahbubnagar. KCR and the TRS seem to have a friendly equation with the most powerful voice of the Muslims in the state, the All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, but there is no open alliance with the MIM and there are fears that Muslim voters may alienate the TRS as it is being seen as close to the BJP. There are also serious doubts over KCR’s gamble of calling for an early election. Ground reports indicate that the Congress has regrouped itself, and the alliance it has formed with the Telugu Desam Party, Left and the Telanagana Jana Samithi has formidable arithmetic on the ground. The combined vote share of the allies was nearly 40 percent in 2014 when the TRS managed to win just over half the seats with 34 percent vote share. The political dynamics seem to lend weight to the Congress’s allegation that the rivalry between KCR and the prime minister is ostensible. However, the fact that the TRS has an alliance with the MIM, which is formidable in Hyderabad, is a headache for the Congress. TRS leaders also point out that the TDP had an open alliance with the BJP before shifting sides, and hence, the Congress’s grand alliance (Maha Kootami as it is called in Telugu) is an alliance of opportunity and not one of values. But, in all this, what’s there for the BJP? Firstly, the Bharatiya Janata Party clearly hopes for a Congress defeat in Telangana. As a party, its stakes are minimal in the assembly polls, and hence, its ideal result would be a TRS win. However, in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP desperately needs allies in the south of India, and TRS is a potential candidate. But BJP leaders insist that they want to create an independent identity in the state and the prime minister targeting KCR is a message, that the party cannot be taken lightly by regional players. Finally, the nature of the attacks the two leaders made against each other was fierce and personal, and the language suggests that it needs to be taken seriously. But then, real life politics is stranger than fiction, and the sharper an exchange, the stronger the perception of being rivals!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

That is why I closed that door. Those who want to speak ill of me, they can. But I am convinced that whatever I did was correct,” he said. He was addressing students of the ITM University. Confirming his remark, he said the push for Sajjad would have been justified as he has the numbers. “Whatever I said is right. Sajjad Lone has the numbers, obviously Delhi will push for him,” the governor told  . Malik has reinforced his allegations against Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) chief Omar Abdullah for not showing seriousness in forming the government. “If PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and NC leader Omar Abdullah were serious about forming a government (by joining hands) in Jammu and Kashmir, they should have rung me up, or sent me a letter” Governor Malik said. The governor said that he took the decision of dissolving the assembly without seeking any advice or direction or holding any discussion with Delhi. He clarified that as per the state Constitution, he did not have to take permission from the president or Parliament. ""I returned at 4 PM from Delhi and I got a briefing from intelligence officials about the situation. I found it needless to talk to Delhi, because two days ago I had met them all,” Governor Malik said. Reacting to the Governor’s speech in Madhya Pradesh, Omar Abdullah said in a tweet that he has never known a “politically appointed governor going against the wishes of the Centre”. However, minutes after the tweet, Abdullah tweeted congratulating the governor for “not looking to Delhi and for not taking their instructions.” Contrary to Malik’s move of dissolving the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the governor should have given the parties wanting to form the government a chance, instead of dissolving the Assembly. “He (Malik) has to defend himself in front of the government in Delhi, and you know what the government is all about. The Assembly should have seen who has the majority. It cannot be decided in the Raj Bhawan. Why didn’t they dissolve the Assembly earlier?” Abdullah told  . Malik’s comments come amid political turmoil in J&K and accusations of him being the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘puppet’. People’s Conference leader Sajjad Lone had staked claim on the formation of the Jammu and Kashmir government in alliance with the BJP after a coalition of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), National Conference (NC) and the Congress approached Malik to stake their claim. After the two coalitions approached Malik to form the government in the state, he elected to dissolve the state government. According to  , he said both the PDP and Sajjad had ‘no numbers’ to form the government as nobody among them came forward with their numbers. He added that if either side had managed to form government, it would have deteriorated the situation prevailing in the Valley for past several months. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Bahar Dutt,"American national John Allen Chau’s killing by members of a protected and reclusive tribe in the Andamans, possibly with arrows, sent shock waves across India and the world. For a western mind hooked on the idea that all parts of the planet including the remote polar regions can be penetrated and conquered easily, the idea seemed preposterous – almost archaic – that a handful of men could kill an individual with just a bow and arrow. But here’s what the headlines are not telling you. This incident is in fact symptomatic of some of the broader changes being initiated on the island to overthrow a decades old ‘hands off’ policy, and open up the chain of islands like a box of chocolates for real estate and tourism sharks to bite into. Earlier, permission had to be taken for tourists to travel to these areas, most of which were off-limit in the past. And there are other plans afoot, courtesy a special committee appointed to review the current laws related to India’s coastline, that will introduce a slew of policy measures endangering not just the tribal islanders, but also stress the fragile ecology here. First, it’s important to understand why the islands are so special and why the Indian government followed a policy of protectionism in the past. Just 37 of the group of 572 islands, are permanently inhabited, by a mix of indigenous tribes and Indians (the latter were brought here as prisoners of the British, after the First War of Independence in 1857). The Nicobar Islands are home to two 'Mongloid' tribes – the Shompen and Nicobarese. The 'Negrito' tribes are believed to have arrived in the islands from Africa up to 60,000 years ago. All are nomadic hunter-gatherers, hunting wild pig and monitor lizard, and catching fish with bows and arrows. They also collect honey, roots and berries from the forest. Some of the Nicobarese people do some form of cultivation, and are also involved in what are considered ‘mainstream’ jobs. Each of these tribal groups have faced an onslaught from outsiders;  Great Andamanese for instance today number just 43. The tribe that has suffered most from contact with outsiders: 99 percent have been wiped out since the British first colonized the islands, the Onges number just 100 – their forest home has been plundered over the years by poachers and loggers. Then there is the Sentinelese, the ones that Chau sought to ‘befriend’ – their population estimated at 50-100. They are the most isolated of all the tribes – they have no peaceful contact with outsiders, and it is said – they fire warning arrows at those who approach. The islands also boast of a rich biodiversity. Of the 9,000 species recorded here, over a 1,000 are endemic, which means they are found just here and NOWHERE else in the world. A great example is the majestic Narcondam hornbill found on the island by the same name, the Andaman Day Gecko and the Andaman woodpecker. The islands themselves are considered a global biodiversity hotspot but threats are always looming large from ill-planned developers and commercial interests. Now take a look at the plans in store that will most certainly flatten out biodiversity as well as endanger the tribal groups here. The Draft Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2018 was introduced based on recommendations from the ‘Shailesh Nayak Committee’ report. This new draft permits the opening up of ecologically important inter-tidal zones, to destructive and polluting activities. A conglomerate of scientists and lawyers working on coastal issues wrote to the Environment Minister Dr Harshvardhan in October, red flagging some of the decisions being taken, along with sending a detailed critique to the policy makers. Sweeping changes have been made in the earlier law referred to as the Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2011, that now allows developers of shopping and housing complexes, hotels and entertainment complexes to walk in, thus diluting safeguards in place before. These are broad and open-ended phrases that are open to interpretation, thus opening the floodgates for the entry of many detrimental activities as ‘permissible’ ones. Another concern that has been red flagged by biologists is the arbitrary classification of ecologically sensitive areas. “Eco-tourism” activities have been allowed in the ecologically sensitive areas of what is referred to as ‘ICRZ I-A’- these include areas such as coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes, which are not only ecologically sensitive, but are also critical for the survival of the islands as they buffer the islands against socio-ecological pressures and disasters. Many ecosystems such as rocky beaches, areas with high biodiversity, fish breeding and spawning areas etc. have been left out of this notification even though they are crucial for the islands. The Andaman and Nicobar and the Lakshadweep have unique geological history, and their coasts are influenced by a combination of tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric and ecological processes. Not only are they different from the coast of the mainland, they are also particularly fragile and vulnerable to climate change. The draft ICRZ notification 2018 does not take into account these particularities of the island ecosystem. Even habitats frequented by the critically endangered species like the sea cow or the Dugong has not been spared. Inter-tidal areas are also important feeding sites for dugongs, as they may contain sea grass species that are preferred. Dugongs are highly endangered species, with less than 50 individuals left in the Indian Ocean, and facing a rapid decline of population, and their conservation must be a priority. Disturbance of such areas through activities permitted above or accidents such as oil spills may be the death knell for these animals and may lead to local extinction. Biologists working on the islands have urged that the protective safeguards in the 2011 Notification should be retained. With these sweeping changes being introduced in government policy, the ethereal beauty and uniqueness of the Andaman and Nicobar islands could be lost forever. It is but sad that the Sentinelese had to take it upon them to protect their island. In this day when social media is the beast, this ‘primitive’ tribal group has managed, with just a bow and arrow, to send a message to the entire world – leave our land and forest alone.

Chad Day,"The special counsel in the Russia investigation is accusing former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of violating his plea agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators, an extraordinary allegation that could expose him to a lengthier prison sentence – and potentially more criminal charges. The torpedoing of Manafort's plea deal, disclosed in  on Monday, 26 November, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller's team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation. That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel's office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel's legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case. Prosecutors said they will detail the ""nature of the defendant's crimes and lies"" in writing at a later date to the judge. Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he ""believes he provided truthful information"" during a series of sessions with Mueller's investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can't resolve the conflict, and US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him. Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel's office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts. Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the US in violation of federal law. As part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with the government “in any and all matters” prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors there are   the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes. But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal. Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort's potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet. He continues to cooperate with Mueller.

PTI,"Suspended AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and seven other rebels may launch a new party in December, the Punjab legislator indicated Tuesday, 27 November. Khaira, suspended AAP MP Dharamvira Gandhi and Simarjit Singh Bains, who leads AAP ally Lok Insaaf Party, said they will form a new political party to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls if they get the people's mandate. They will seek this mandate at a meeting in Patiala next month, a press release said. Khaira and seven other Aam Aadmi Party MLAs rebelled in July when the party replaced him as Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly. Bholath MLA Khaira and Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu were then suspended from the party. Khaira said they will start an eight-day long 'Insaaf' march from 8 December to seek justice in cases related to the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. The 180-km long march from Talwandi Sabo will end in a huge public meeting in Patiala on 16 December, he said. They will seek a mandate then from the people to form a third alternative in Punjab to contest the Lok Sabha elections, Khaira said. The Insaaf Party headed by Bains has two MLAs in the assembly.

Revati Laul,"Jijabai Vasavi is a hundred years old. When she was born, India was under British occupation and World War 1 had just concluded. You might say, look at how the imagination of the world has changed in this time. Gandhi was only just getting his non-cooperation movement started. People in her part of the world in rural Maharashtra didn’t have bicycles or electricity or cameras. She would tell you, in these hundred years, what has altered most significantly is this: When she was a child, if you grew food, it was an absolute guarantee you would not starve. Now, in 2018, if you are a farmer, it is almost certain you will. And so, it is that at the age of one hundred that she walked from her village Baradi in Nandurbar district for ten kilometres to get to the nearest town from where she got into a shared taxi. From there to the train in the next town, and then another train, and after nearly twenty hours of continuous and taxing travel, she arrived in Mumbai, to join thousands of protesting farmers demanding many things, but essentially one thing — the right to live. It’s ridiculous that they grow food for the rest of the country to eat but are so consumed by debt from crop failure and no means to buy expensive fertilizer or even more expensive diesel for their tractors. “Enough is enough,” Jijabai and many others from her village said. This year has been a particularly bad crop in her district. The yield was half what it was from last year. Her children and grand-children all work as daily wagers on other farms and on road and building projects and still it’s hard to find enough to eat. Things are in fact so impossible that Jijabai decided to put herself and her tired body though this agonizing journey to make her voice count. Even though she was just a speck – one of the thousands of people to have arrived at Mumbai’s Azan Maidan on 21 November, ahead of the long march to Delhi – she considered it vital enough for her to be there. On that day, Sachinbhai — a leader from the Lok Sangharsh Morcha in Maharasthra said Jijabai woke up at 4 am with the others. And since the participation was entirely voluntary, most people, including Jijabai didn’t have anything to eat all day. She had her first cup of chai after noon. But there was fire in her belly. With the system weighed so heavily against them, farmers across the country are preparing to be in Delhi’s Ramlila maidan on 29 and 30 November, demanding that a special session of parliament be convened to raise crucial survival issues. Her voice was barely audible after a day at the rally. “Sorry, I’ve lost my voice,” she said, apologetic, but happy to see the issue get some traction. At the other end of the country, K Balakrishnan from the ‘Jai Kisan Andolan’ and Convener of the Tamil Nadu farmers’ agitation, said even rich farmers are in distress with cyclone Gaja having destroyed their crop. This is why crop insurance, the guarantee of a minimum support price from the state, and the allotment of land promised to tribals is crucial, he explained. And in the case of farmers reeling from the effects of the cyclone, compensation that hasn’t still been given. Ramesh Chander from Jind in Haryana, echoes these sentiments. He also added that this government has been particularly harsh on farmers. Until 2014, there was at least a minimum guarantee of 50-55 days of daily wages under the MNREGA scheme. Now, in the non-agricultural season, there is no guarantee of getting daily wage work. And the supplementary income from the sale of cattle once it’s past its prime has stopped, thanks to the cow vigilante groups, he added. “The rate of purchase of milk has dropped and I can’t sell my buffalo either,” Chander lamented. Adding that farmers groups – 200 of them were also being strategic in the timing of their agitation. “Yeh election ka saal hai, this is an election season.” He’s lost 30,000 rupees this agricultural season, and if he doesn’t join the tidal wave of voices now, it will be a big opportunity lost. His survival could be at stake. Avik Saha, Organising Secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination group or the AIKSCC summed it up in a catch-phrase he has coined for the march – “Modi Ko Harao, Rahul Ko Darao” (Remove Modi, Scare Rahul). “Our job,” he clarified, “is to make it impossible to ignore farmers.” The politics of the movement is absolutely transparent. They would like to build pressure on the Modi government at a time when they are aware it is facing the heat on every front. And they would like to extract these basic promises ahead of the 2019 elections. The long-term goal is to build the 200 farmers groups that have signed on into a collective block. Lingraj, a farmers’ activist from Odisha, said his organisation doesn’t have money. So about a thousand farmers from that state will travel by train, unreserved. “You can classify the farmers by the routes they take from different parts of the country,” Avik Saha remarked. Farmers from Bihar and Odisha can only travel unreserved, but in Karnataka, there are some who will be flying in. For now, they have nothing to hold onto but their dissent. Farming is all that Jijabai knows. At a hundred plus years, she would like to be able to hold on to that one basic thing – the right to grow food and for it to be sustainable.  ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"There was a time, starting with his Independence Day speech in 2014, when even Indians who   voted for Prime Minister Narendra Modi imagined that they too could be a part of his growth and development vision for India. This belief was reinforced in March 2015 when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formed a coalition government with the People's Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. In those months – despite odd attacks on churches, provocative statements of his party and ministerial colleagues, and a  affiliate's controversial Ghar Wapasi campaign – it appeared that Modi was willing to put the divisive past behind him. Forget Indians who had not voted for Modi; since August 2017, as dissatisfaction triggered by the slapdash roll-out of GST grew, it became evident – borne out repeatedly by election verdicts since the Gujarat result – that even large sections of those who   for him were no longer backing him. This sense deepened in June after Mehbooba Mufti resigned, following which BJP pulled out of the coalition and withdrew support to the PDP. The dissolution of the State Assembly last week has further pushed BJP to its core agenda. To understand, there is need to analyse what Modi jettisoned in March 2015 when he and BJP president Amit Shah were in attendance, when Mufti Mohammed Sayeed took oath as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir along with BJP's Nirmal Singh as Deputy Chief Minister, besides other 23 other ministers from the two parties. It was a courageous decision to align with the PDP. To do so, Modi had to silence the slogan which served as his party's clarion call on J&K for 62 years since 1953. The slogan was coined by the party in memory of its iconic founder president, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, after he died in June 1953 in Srinagar jail where he was detained for forcibly entering the state despite orders to the contrary: (The Kashmir where Mookerjee laid down his life, is ours) Neither was the air rent with this emotional slogan to convey sense of satisfaction of being in power in a 'lost' state – albeit in a coalition – nor did any of the party leaders or cadre give voice to what they have grown up with – Mookerjee's slogan, or the rhyme, he shouted along with party activists, including 29-year-old Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in the course of his agitation on Kashmir: (In one country, there cannot be two constitutions, two heads and two flags) Since Mookerjee's death, abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which grants autonomous status to the state along with a separate Constitution, was one of the three contentious issues that was the BJP's hallmark, contributing to its claim of being a party with a difference. But post 2014, with the BJP having a majority of its own and not being dependent on coalition partners, this response would not have sounded convincing. This was especially true because the BJP did not dilute its posture on the other two disruptive demands: construction of Ram temple and introduction of Uniform Civil Code. The formation of the coalition was not billed as evidence of majoritarian triumph in the only Muslim-majority state, despite this having been the stated objective since the Jana Sangh days. Each of BJP's 25 seats were located in predominantly Hindu-majority seats of the Jammu region. The BJP had mounted an audacious Mission 44+ campaign for the 2014 Assembly polls. Despite this acrimonious campaign, its decision to align with the PDP indicated a visible departure from Mookerjee's and BJP's past visions of the state’s relationship with the rest of India. Modi realised that as the national helmsman, he had to view challenges in the state beyond what the party was accustomed to. In utterances, Modi and colleagues indicated the necessity to leave behind the 3Cs – conflict, contradictions, cynicism. Instead, they had to follow just one mantra: R – reboot or reconciliation. Clearly, the party realised that to resolve conflict, dialogue and joint action were the only ways to reinforce the region's pluralistic heritage and extricate itself from the quagmire it has been trapped in for decades. Yet, Modi squandered the chance of securing the love and affection of the Kashmiris like Vajpayee did. His reiteration of Insaniyat (Humanism), Jamhooriyat (Democracy) and Kashmiriyat (Kashmir's age-old legacy of Hindu-Muslim amity) rang hollow because the Centre faltered on every pledge it made, the worst being the lack of urgency on the flood rehabilitation package. The situation worsened after the generational transition in PDP following Mufti's death. From April 2016, when Mehbooba Mufti became chief minister, the BJP's engagement in J&K was not with an eye on ushering normalcy into the state. There is little doubt that the BJP faces an uphill battle in 2019 and this cannot be won on the basis of this government's performance. To prevent the parliamentary hustings being reduced to a state-wise aggregation of polls, the BJP requires a set of emotive issues. This plank has been under construction for the past several months. The majoritarian platform contain several elements – Ram temple, fresh confrontation in  , renaming of cities and towns, continuing campaigns for cow protection and against Love Jihad, and so on. The BJP's latest tactics on Kashmir and its declaration that the state requires no special treatment coupled with the continuing tough posture on Pakistan completes the bouquet of Hindutva-centric issues with which the BJP will approach the electorate. As far as Kashmir is concerned, there is now little to differentiate between the sentiment of the fringe that supports BJP and the party's mainstream. The BJP's promise of a paradigm shift is now a mirage. In the hope of consolidating Hindus to vote on the basis of their religious identity, he has lost the support of those who considered him a pragmatist and not a committed ideologue. The wheel has come full circle for Modi, and also for J&K. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday, 26 November, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resign if he cannot ensure the CM's security, days after a man flung chilli powder at the Aam Aadmi Party chief inside the Delhi secretariat. ""The people of Delhi are proud of their honest chief minister. I want to ask the people of the country if they feel the same about their prime minister,"" Kejriwal said. He hit out at the BJP-led NDA government over the alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter-jet deal, and over Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi fleeing the country. Targeting the ""Gujarat model"" of development, the chief minister said, ""I challenge... the AAP government in Delhi did much more than he (Narendra Modi) did in Gujarat in 12 years."" Later in the Assembly, Kejriwal asked the prime minister “to step down if he cannot ensure the Delhi chief minister's security.” ""Narendra Modi should resign if he cannot protect Delhi's chief minister,"" Kejriwal said in the House, which had met to discuss the attack on him and the alleged deletion of names from the voters' list. ""If Delhi Police comes under the elected government of Delhi, it will start working for the good of the people,"" he asserted. The resolution, moved by Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain and later adopted by the Assembly with voice votes, also stated that in view of such pending amendments, necessary steps should be initiated by the Centre to devolve certain powers to the elected government, so that it is in a position to have control over the Delhi Police.

Taha Siddiqui,"Ten years ago, the Indian financial capital Mumbai, saw its worst terror attack in the city’s history, and perhaps the country’s history. The attack carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives from Pakistan went on for four days, starting on 26 November, and left over 160 people dead. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was caught alive, and revealed in subsequent investigations how the LeT planned, organised and executed the deadly act. Ten men had arrived from Pakistan via sea, disembarking from Karachi city, and landing on a beach in Mumbai. The Indian authorities hanged Kasab, the lone survivor of the attack in 2012. The Americans also caught another person involved in the attacks, David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-origin American, who confessed that he had done reconnaissance missions in Mumbai prior to the attacks, and had shared this information with those organising the attacks. Headley is currently serving a 35-year sentence in an American prison. On paper, LeT is banned in Pakistan since 2002, but it operates under different names today in the country and continues to find recruits, carry out cross-border terrorism from Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and expand its footprint in Pakistan without much hindrance. Lakhvi is said to be in charge of LeT in Pakistan and is a close associate of Hafiz Saeed, who founded LeT in the late eighties. Hafiz Saeed publicly disassociated himself from LeT and launched Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), which he professes is a charity organisation. However, both local and international authorities believe JuD is a front for LeT. The United States has even offered a $10 million reward for information that can lead to Saeed’s conviction for the Mumbai attacks. Post 26/11, JuD came under international scrutiny too and was designated a global terrorist group by the United Nations. Following this, Pakistan also took some cosmetic measures against it; but the group once again relaunched under a new name called Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation. Even that has been exposed and since then it is suspected to have come up with another new name called Tehreek-e-Azadi Jammu and Kashmir. Many point to its linkages with the Pakistan military. It is suspected that LeT enjoys support from the so-called parallel shadow government, and the real policy makers of the country: the Pakistan Army. Therefore, evidences against the group are rare to come by, and there is very little that the civilian authorities can do, even if they want to take action against the group. In 2015, Tariq Khosa, the former head of Pakistan’s leading civilian law enforcement agency called the Federal Investigation Authority, wrote how there was enough evidence that his organisation had uncovered against the LeT operating from a camp near the city of Karachi. Despite that, no one in Pakistan has been convicted to date in the Mumbai attacks trials, which continue to linger on without any meaningful progress for the last nine years. In an interview this year, when Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif posed a question to the reporter asking why the Mumbai attack trials had not concluded and why militants were being allowed to cross the border and kill people, Pakistani courts initiated a treason case against the former premier and the journalist who published the interview, for defaming national institutions. Observers say it is to serve the strategic foreign policy purposes of the Pakistani military which wants to keep the Kashmir conflict militarised, so that the Armed Forces’ relevance and dominance in Pakistan continues to remain unchallenged – because as long as there is a conflict with the next-door neighbour, the Pakistan army will be able to justify its budgets, its interference in political matters and its human rights abuses in the name of security. Recently, the military has also started using the LeT’s charity wing, JuD, for domestic political purposes. The JuD launched the Milli Muslim League (MML), and its backed candidates contested the recent general elections. While a former military general alluded that the group was introduced to politics to mainstream militants, the real reason many believe they were introduced in Punjab, Pakistan is to dent the vote bank of the last ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz faction (PMLN). The military believes the PMLN is harmful for its interests as it wants to normalise relations with India. But it is not just state support the LeT seems to enjoy in Pakistan. The group also seems to enjoy popularity among the population, partly because it can operate freely in many parts of the country, but mainly because these regions are areas where vulnerable Pakistanis are looking for subsistence, given lack of income, and at times, due to circumstances that have forced them to look for help. Also, the local Pakistani media reports on the movement favourably, projecting it as a welfare organisation. I have followed the group closely during my reporting missions in the country and have seen how they run a strong network of charity organisations. In one such reporting trip to South Punjab, I saw Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, one of the fronts of LeT, helping out the flood-affected by bringing them food and providing them shelter. When I asked one of the organisers about their motive behind the help, the organiser told me it was to find recruits among this population for their movement, adding how many households in such rural populations had large families, with too many children. When I had first learnt of how they were brainwashing youngsters in this manner, I had mentioned it to a serving Pakistani military intelligence official that I knew as a source. But this policy of allowing “external-looking” militancy to continue to exist has come back to haunt the country. In recent times, many former LeT operatives have joined other terrorist organisations like the ISIS, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi etc, and now consider Pakistan a target too and have carried out terror attacks on Pakistani soil. Pakistan’s policy makers must realise that by allowing such groups to continue operating in the country and thinking the country will remain safe from them is not the way forward. The Pakistani military repeatedly says it is committed to fighting terrorism and bringing peace. But if that is true, one of the right steps in that direction should include an actual crackdown against groups like the LeT. To start with, Pakistan should punish those involved in the Mumbai attacks and then also dismantle its infrastructure in the country. Otherwise, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region looks doubtful. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The first time voters are excited to cast their first vote and, boy, do they know their politics! We spoke about the job scene in the state, whether the alcohol ban is a good thing or bad, the rise (or not!) of the BJP and whether its time that Mizoram finally focuses on its road and public transport system. They also opened up about other things. Like the need to have opportunities to earn an extra buck on the side, more facilities for those who want to pursue things like football and dance, and of course, more focus on the youth. Finally, we ask them who they think will win this time – the traditional parties like the Congress and the MNF or a political underdog like the BJP? While some thought that experience – i.e., the Congress – will take it all, others went beyond the choices offered and chose the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) for its focus on the youth and teenagers.

PTI,"Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid on Monday, 26 November, alleged that former President Abdulla Yameen had tried to play India against China like a ""puppet master"" and said the new government was looking into the deals made with China to assess the debt accumulation. Maldives knows the importance of India as it was an ""important"" partner, said Shahid who was on his first visit to India after assuming charge as the foreign minister of Maldives. The visit assumes significance as the ties between both the countries were severely strained under the previous government in the island nation. The remarks of both the foreign and finance ministers of Maldives assume significance as reports suggest that China had been trying to expand its influence over the island nation. Ameer said, ""The Chinese portion of investment is taking long in assessment because all these deals took place in secrecy."" Shahid targeted former President Abdulla Yameen, alleging he tried to play India against China. He said Maldives considered India such an ""important partner"" that new Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih would be making his first foreign visit to New Delhi on 17 December. Shahid, however, said that on the 'Belt and Road Initiative', the country would continue their cooperation with not only China but with other countries too. Ameer said they have identified a number of projects which were bought at an ""inflated price"" from China. ""We believe most of these projects have been bought at an inflated price and we are looking into them. But you have to understand that all these projects are now completed and we cannot renegotiate them. In going forward, our main objective would be to reduce the cost of these infrastructure projects,"" Ameer told reporters. Minister of Economic Development Fayyaz Ismail said the island nation was trying to get past the instability that was witnessed in the last couple of years. He also said they were planning to ease visa norms so that Indian investors could travel to Maldives for business.

Relations between India and the Maldives had slumped further after Yameen imposed emergency on 5 February this year.

PTI,"The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) crossed swords on Monday, 26 November over the latter's frequent outbursts against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and on the issue of sharing seats for next year's General election. LJP parliamentary board chair Chirag Paswan accused the RLSP chief and Union minister Upendra Kushwaha of rowing in two boats and using pressure tactics to finalise a seat-sharing arrangement between the NDA partners in Bihar by Friday. ""By setting a deadline and taking a stand that he will not talk to anybody except the prime minister, he (Kushwaha) is taking recourse to pressure tactics. Besides, he keeps on speaking against the chief minister. You cannot go on speaking against the NDA constituents while being in the coalition. It is like rowing in two boats,"" Chirag said. Reacting to the young LJP leader's statement, RLSP general secretary Madhaw Anand said the party had been following the coalition dharma ever since they became a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), adding that it needed no lessons from Chirag or his father and LJP president, Ram Vilas Paswan. He made it clear that the RLSP would continue to raise any issue it deemed to be in the interest of the state, irrespective of whether the party was in the NDA or not. ""We do not wish to waste much time on the opinions the other NDA constituents express about us. At present, we are busy with the preparations for our rally in East Champaran on 6 December when Kushwaha would sound the poll bugle for the party,"" Anand added. Kushwaha, a former Janata Dal (United) leader, had floated the RLSP in 2013 and contested the 2014 Lok Sabha poll as an NDA ally, bagging all the three seats it had contested. On the JDU's return to the NDA last year, it was being speculated that the development would upset leaders like Kushwaha and former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha founder Jitan Ram Manjhi, both of whom had burnt their bridges with Kumar. Manjhi had quit the NDA earlier this year, ahead of elections to the Legislative Council, where he secured a berth for his son with the help of the RJD-Congress combine. It was seen as a rebuff to Kushwaha whose party has been demanding a greater share than the JDU, since the RLSP chief belonged to the Koeri caste, which is much more sizeable than Kumar's Kurmi community. Kushwaha's high pitch on the seat-sharing issues has brought him in confrontation with the JDU initially. Senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had also taken dig at the RLSP chief over its aggressive comments against Kumar. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, had on Monday, 26 November, laid the foundation stone for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, which will facilitate easy passage for Sikh pilgrims to the historic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. The decision to build the passage – from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district to the International Border – was taken by the Union Cabinet on 22 November. Further, Mehbooba said that the decision taken by Pakistan is commendable and the same was reciprocated with grace and statesmanship by the leadership of our country. By opening up the Kartarpur corridor, the country's leadership has exhibited statesmanship, and that too when electoral exercise is on, she added. ""It has given us an idea that electoral considerations cannot any longer hold back the governments from taking decisions that are aimed to improve the ties between two countries,"" she said. In Jammu and Kashmir, the opening of Uri-Muzafarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot routes for the people was a big achievement, she asserted. Condemning the recent killings in Kashmir, Mehbooba said as the wounds inflicted by past violence were still fresh, nine more people were killed this week in the valley. Urging the youth to shun the path of violence, she said there were solutions available within democratic and diplomatic space.

Shadab Moizee,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded just one Muslim candidate in the 2018 Rajasthan Assembly elections and he is going to contest against one of the tallest Congress leaders in the state. Meet Yunus Khan. Khan is a minister in the current Vasundhara Raje Cabinet and has filed his nomination from Tonk Assembly seat. Why is this seat crucial? Because this is the seat where Congress has fielded perhaps their most popular leader of the state, Sachin Pilot. Speaking exclusively to  , Khan answered the questions on Muslim representation in BJP, development policies and Sachin Pilot.  Why were you, an outsider, offered a ticket from Tonk and not the incumbent MLA? All of us are mere workers of the BJP. We have worked as the servants of the people. In the last 5 years, I was responsible for the construction of roads across Rajasthan and the bus transport service. I have visited every corner of the state. Even in Tonk, we constructed roads in all 36 Gram Panchayats. We also provided them national and state highways. So it’s unfair to reduce me to a constituency and call Sachin Pilot a state-wide leader. I entered politics before him. I have worked for this state. It’s okay if he has a tag of state president but I have also served the people in Rajasthan.   Has BJP made you the sacrificial lamb? These are the words of media. I don’t want to comment on it. But, what I will tell you is that on 11 December, the public and BJP workers will show you who is sacrificed and who is the lamb.     But Sachin Pilot is a big Congress leader. Also, Tonk has a significant number of Muslim voters and hence the BJP has fielded you.  I agree that Sachin Pilot has become a taller leader than Ashok Gehlot. I have been campaigning in Tonk. I don’t think that a big face alone will be of much help. This election is between a public servant and a master. I think Tonk’s voters will elect a public servant.   What do you mean when you say ‘master and servant’? I use these terms because Sachin Pilot is the chief of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC). He himself chose to contest from this seat because candidates in Congress are handpicked by Sachin Pilot and his friend Rahul Gandhi. And I call myself a servant because I have served the people of Tonk and Rajasthan. We have ensured that villages are connected to a road. He (Pilot) was an MP and a minister for 10 years and he never paid any attention to the people of Tonk. On the other hand, in all the 170 villages you will find a road constructed, which was commissioned by me.   PM Modi talks about ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ but BJP gives a ticket to just one Muslim candidate in 200 seats.   When a road is constructed or when water connection is provided, then all castes and religions avail the benefits. What about representation from that community?  Every party has its own political reasoning on who to give a ticket to and who not to. Tickets are not distributed on the basis of caste or religion. It depends on how much a person believes in the party’s ideology. I am connected to BJP’s ideology. I am a dedicated party worker. Hence, I am provided with the ticket. If someone else also works for the party then they too will be provided with the ticket.   Will you contest elections on national issues or local issues?   I am not a national leader and hence, I will not go into the national issues. The biggest local issue here is employment and how to create more employment. New industries need to be set up so that more jobs are created. New projects should be announced. These will be my issues. But you were in power for 5 years. Then why is unemployment an issue? Those who have ruined the state and this country for 55 years don’t have the right to demand our 5-year report card. But we will provide a report card. We did provide employment opportunities. We provided 3.25 lakh government jobs. Approximately 18 lakh were employed in private and other sectors. Around 45 lakh were given Mudra loans. So we have provided job opportunities and we want to do more. We are fighting on these issues. We want to increase the pace of development. Otherwise, whenever Congress has come to power, the speed of development has been reduced. We are working to ensure uninterrupted development.   How many seats will the BJP win? BJP will get an absolute majority under the leadership of Vasundhara Raje.   But no one is saying what number of seats. We will win as many seats as we won the last time. Are you feeling the pressure of this high-profile contest?   There is pressure. But not on me. It’s on him who you are calling a stalwart Congress leader.  But surveys show that BJP is trailing. We will talk about it on 11 December at 11 am about who is under pressure, who is the sacrificial lamb and who the surveys support. And we won’t, but TV channels across the world will say that history has been created in Tonk. This election is between Sachin Pilot and the voters of Tonk & BJP workers. This election isn’t about Yunus Khan. If we lose, then it’s my loss but if we win, it will be the victory of Tonk.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday, 26 November, trained guns at Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa over the attacks in Pathankot and Amritsar, and warned him against disturbing the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab and the country. “I would like to ask Pakistan Army chief Qamar Bajwa something, as a soldier. Which army teaches to violate ceasefire and kill jawans on the other side? Which army teaches to send people to attack Pathankot and Amritsar? This is cowardliness,” said Singh. Singh was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor to connect the Dera Baba Nanak Gurudwara in Gurdaspur to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur across the LoC in Pakistan’s Punjab. Vice President of India M Venkaiah Naidu, along with Singh, laid the foundation stone for the corridor. Union Ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Nitin Gadkari were also present. Backing Singh’s comments, Naidu said killing of innocent people will not be tolerated. “I must tell what Punjab CM said, that we can't allow terrorism and can't let innocents die, this isn't going to help, it's not the way; it must be understood. That’s why, let this be the start of this great event,” he said. Singh on Sunday had declined Pakistan's invite to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for the Kartarpur Corridor on the other side of the border, even as his cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu accepted the request. In a letter to Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Singh said though it was a historic occasion, he regretted his inability to be present, citing terror attacks in his state and killings of Indian soldiers by Pakistan troops as the reason. Secondly, the chief minister had claimed that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has started its nefarious activities in Punjab. ""Since March 2017, the state has neutralised 19 ISI-armed and controlled modules, apprehended 81 terrorists and seized 79 weapons, numerous grenades of the HG-84 type made in Pakistan's Ordnance factories with Austrian know how, and some IEDs,"" the chief minister claimed. The last attack took place in Amritsar few days ago, on a peaceful religious congregation in a village. Three people were killed and 19, including children, were wounded, Singh said, adding that the terrorists had been caught. ""I hope that the (Pakistan) prime minister will understand the circumstances... It will not be possible for me to be present in Pakistan on this historic occasion, despite the fact that paying my respects at Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib has always been my cherished dream which will hopefully be fulfilled once these hostilities and killings are stopped,"" he said. Thanking Qureshi for the invitation, Singh recalled his visit to Pakistan as Punjab chief minister in the past. ""As you will see from the stone laid at the Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, it was my grandfather Maharaja Bhupindra Singh who carried out flood protection measures from 1920 to 1929 to protect our gurdwara which was being ravaged by floods in river Ravi each year,"" Singh wrote in the letter. Singh expressed hope that the Pakistan prime minister ""will do all he can to bring the two countries together on the road to peace and friendship."" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Vishnu Gopinath,"Is Symbiosis Law School withholding Letters of Recommendation from its alumni after they wrote to the college administration expressing concern over the administration’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against  , Professor Srinivas Methuku? Several alumni of Symbiosis Law School have told  that they have not yet received Letters of Recommendation (LoR) from the college, despite having applied for the same as per the college’s prescribed procedure. Most, if not all foreign universities of repute require a Letter of Recommendation from a professor who has taught a student during their time in college. Some foreign universities even require two LoRs from the university the student graduated from. They also claimed that many others had also been refused Letters of Recommendation. None of these refusals were made over official communication channels. They were either communicated over the phone, in person, or in some instances, Whatsapp (screengrabs of the same are in  ’s possession). Now, the standard procedure for seeking a Letter of Recommendation from Symbiosis Law School can be found on the   of Symbiosis Law School, Pune. Here’s a screenshot for quick reference. Other students of Symbiosis Law School told  that getting a physical Letter of Recommendation from the college usually takes around two weeks. However, an online LoR doesn’t require the same time. It’s a form sent to the professor in question, and the professor fills out the same and reverts. The first letter was sent to the College’s Chancellor and Vice Chancellor on 30 October, and the second to the Registrar of Symbiosis International Deemed University on 8 November. The subject of both letters was the alumni's concern over the incident of college/hostel authorities   of Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, Apoorva Yarabahalli and Snigdha Jayakrishnan from their college hostel rooms on 26 October, and the Director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur reportedly verbally threatening them with rustication. Additionally, the alumni’s letters also asked the administration how CCTV footage of the two girls arguing with the college hostel’s authorities taken from the hostel’s CCTV cameras, also mysteriously found its way onto the internet. Symbiosis International University’s registrar, Dr MS Shejul replied to the first letter on 31 October, stating that disciplinary action was taken against the two girls as part of procedure. The reply added that the college couldn’t comment on the video because the video, which contained footage from the Symbiosis Law School Hyderabad hostel CCTV, wasn’t “sent officially” by the University. At the time of writing this piece, the college has not officially replied to the second letter sent by the alumni on 8 November. Now to be clear, the college has not officially denied or refused students a letter of recommendation. However, the students allege that through unofficial channels, the director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur refused Letters of Recommendation. In one exchange on Whatsapp, when the student asked Dr Gurpur (the phone number in question has been verified by  ) about her letter of recommendation, after completing the required procedure, Dr Shashikala Gurpur told the former student that they can’t issue LoRs to students who don’t have faith in the college. The students say, in the Whatsapp exchange, Dr Gurpur refers to the letter sent by the students expressing concern about the college’s action against Apoorva and Snigdha, and refuses to provide the college’s support to students who signed the letter sent to them. Now, remember, this wasn’t over an official channel, but Whatsapp. So, the college hasn’t outright refused or denied an LoR officially. They just haven’t provided one yet. Other students who signed the letters told  that they had written to professors at the college for an LoR, who initially agreed to provide the letters, but were informed later that they needed to get permission from the director, Shashikala Gurpur “according to a new circular.” On 24 November, the college told several alumni to reply from their individual email IDs to the college, CCing the person who sent the original letter, explaining that they were rescinding support to the letter. has mailed a questionnaire to Symbiosis Law School’s director and others concerned. When this reporter reached out to Shashikala Gurpur for a statement after the mail, she replied, “I don’t know you” and hung up. With few options left, and with deadlines for their foreign university and Masters’ degree applications fast approaching, many former students are now faced with a tough choice.

Raghav Bahl,"I admire two things about Prime Minister Modi. He is an audacious and energetic propagator of his pet ideas. And he coins really smart acronyms to catch the popular imagination. That was apparent when he celebrated India’s leap of 23 spots, from rank 100 to 77, in the EODB (Ease of Doing Business) Index compiled by the World Bank. Modi beamed. He was now tantalizingly close to his target of “getting India into the Top 50”, so you could not grudge him the joy. “Now our effort is to take India to the five-trillion-dollar club as soon as possible”. Several other things were left unsaid too. Most of us assume, quite innocently, that the World Bank’s EODB Index is the gold standard of economic performance. In reality, it’s an extremely narrow, even misleading, summation of a few economic rules which matter to a tiny,  , sliver of India’s vast population. Here are a few eye-opening (popping?) facts: Even more critical is to check what the EODB Index does   take into account (you will be now astonished to see how lethally narrow its underpinning is): Prime Minister Modi’s older echo chamber, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), had given a dire warning just two days ahead (on 16 November 2018) of his euphoric EODB outing. Although Modi, in another virtuoso act, remained silent on their prophecies of doom (which I am quoting verbatim): But the Gujarat warning was drowned in the EODB din, as Modi conjured up yet another big sounding theme. He announced a “Grand Challenge” for India’s techies to come up with smart ideas in “artificial intelligence, the internet of things, big data analytics and block-chain technologies to streamline and speed up processes”, that would catapult India into the Top 50. He used all the fancy tech terms in vogue to talk up his newest “brain wave”. Two years ago, the income tax department had issued similar notices, slapped taxes, and begun prosecution under the dreaded “angle tax” provisions. It’s an outrageous levy, which places the power to “value” start-ups in the hands of clueless inspectors. Imagine, even the most successful professionals, from private equity and venture capital outfits, get valuations right  . Because valuations, like beauty, lie in the eyes of the beholder! For example, if five investors had valued Flipkart at USD 1 bn, USD 2 bn, USD 3 bn, USD10 bn or USD 15 bn in 2012, who would have been right, and who wrong? Clearly, each person’s valuation would depend on her: Each person would have given different weights to these individual factors, and arrived at any number of different valuations. And each would have been right, because Flipkart was eventually sold for USD 20 bn in 2018. Do you seriously think any of our hypothetical investors would have put money under such a tax regime, where they were being coerced to pay cash taxes on unrealised/uncertain “profits”? Clearly, this tax is a travesty, and tragedy, inflicted on Indian start-ups by Prime Minister Modi. It’s an astonishing repudiation of Stand-up India, Start-up India, Digital India, Make In India and God knows how many more schemes. So, even as Prime Minister Modi got “India Shining” bouquets from his Mumbai/Delhi echo chamber on EODB (Ease of Doing Business), his Gujarati kinsmen and India’s first generation founders, if he had cared to speak to them, would have given a very different “India Taxing” brickbat: Egregious Officers Destroying Business, ie, EODB!

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was also in Ayodhya for similar purposes. Speaking to the media, Thackeray said he was only in Ayodhya to express the sentiments of Indians and Hindus across the world, who are waiting for a Ram temple.

Chengappa Bidanda,"In a significant move to strengthen coastal security management, a decade after the 26/11 sea-borne terrorist attack on Mumbai, the central government now plans to establish a National Academy for Coastal Policing at Gujarat. Today the country’s coastal state governments/UTs lack a permanent cadre for its coastal or marine security police wings and personnel posted there for a few years return to other police duties. As a result, the little hands-on exposure that these police personnel obtain to coastal security is lost when they are transferred elsewhere. For state governments, coastal security management proves to be a challenge because it transcends pure police roles and enters the military realm. And the state governments only possess police forces primarily oriented to operate on land and not the sea. Till the central government raises a Central Marine Police Force (CMPF), the proposed academy will train police personnel from the coastal states/UTs in coastal security management, which straddles both military and police functions. Therefore, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavais mooted the proposal to raise a CMPF in June 2016 at a meeting to review the status of the country’s coastal security management in Mumbai. The state has paid serious attention to coastal security due to the earlier LTTE threat from across the Palk Straits. Raised in 1994, the Tamil Nadu Police Coastal Security Group (CSG) is a well-trained force tasked to protect the state’s 1,076-km coastline. The marine/coastal security police forces in the other eight states and four UTs cannot operationally compare with Tamil Nadu’s CSG. The priorities of the Indian Police are political intelligence and VIP security, among other duties. To therefore expect the state police forces to focus on coastal security management is an unrealistic expectation. The fact that the country has poor police to population ratio with just one policeman for 761 people, which translates into approximately 131 policemen per lakh population, does not enable them to ensure effective coastal security management. Moreover, the state police forces across the country are not really oriented to tackle coastal security, and thereby the need for a CMPF which would fill a vital gap in the national security matrix. Importantly, the lack of progress to install fishing boats with transponders which are linked to the land-based Automatic Identification System is a lacuna in the coastal security system, and nullifies progress made on every other front. Every fishing boat with transponders that is tracked amounts to a pair of ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ at sea becomes part of the coastal security system. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat. State governments believe that national security, especially externally fostered internal security threats are the central government’s responsibility, and therefore, rely on the Indian Navy (IN) and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) across peninsular India to tackle sea-borne terrorist threats. However, the problem arises because the IN patrols the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles given the heavy tonnage of their warships; the ICG covers the waters between 12 and 200 nautical miles. The swathe of seas from the coastline to 12 nautical miles which is afloat with a high density of smaller craft like fishing boats, mechanized trawlers and dhows becomes the responsibility of the coastal/marine police forces. The Centre contributes considerably to the coastal security of peninsular India in terms of marine platforms and funds to establish coastal security police stations; besides other hardware like beach scooters and night vision devices. After the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, the central government established the National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security, with the Cabinet Secretary at its helm, to implement the National Maritime Domain Awareness project. The Navy, assisted by the coast guard, state marine police forces, and other state and central agencies undertook this project. Conceptually speaking, the coast guard is inferior to the fighting navy, but superior to the police in terms of marine platforms, weaponry and training, therefore ideally suited for coastal security management. Its first phase was to provide seamless coverage of India's coastline, which includes installation of a chain of 74 Automatic Identification System receivers along the coast and 46 coastal radars around the country’s mainland and the island territories to track small vessel traffic in the coastal waters. Clearly “boots on the seas” or a coastal security force similar to the Border Security Force, standing guard permanently on the country’s land borders, is necessary to complement this technology-driven security infrastructure. Only an active coastal police force could possibly conduct random checks on cargo in these myriad boats sailing on the shallow waters as a deterrent to wrong doers.

Ravi Joshi,"What is common between two Russians and one Saudi national – Alexander Litivinenko, Sergei Skripal and Jamal Khashoggi? Certain details first. The Russians are double agents, in that they were earlier working for the KGB now known as Federal Security Bureau (FSB) and then defected to the MI6 now called the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in Britain. Both Litivinenko and Skripal were poisoned, first one with a rare radioactive isotope – Polonium 210 and the second one with a nerve agent – Novichok. It was timely medical help that saved Skripal’s life, as the MI6 was well prepared to handle another attempted murder on British soil after the shock and shame of being outwitted by the KGB in Litivinenko’s murder. He was killed in a more primitive way, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, initially with fingers being cut off as part of an aggressive interrogation that devolved, resulting in a painful and tortuous death. President Putin once told a journalist who was becoming a nuisance to the government for highlighting the increasing violence against reporters in 2001, “You know Aleksi, you are not a traitor, you are an enemy”. The journalist asked him what was the difference and how on earth was that supposed to be of any comfort? Putin explained, “Enemies are right in front of you, you are at war with them, then you make an armistice with them, and all is clear. A traitor must be destroyed, crushed,” as quoted by Mark Urban in his latest book  . Though Litivinenko, in his dying declaration, directly blamed Putin for his death, the British government did not reveal it to the press at the time, nor did the Independent Enquiry Commission (set up later) blame Putin directly. They however, blamed the State Agencies of Russia for the death of Litvinenko in October 2006 and the near death of Skripal and his daughter in March 2018. Britain reacted to the killing of Litivinenko almost after 10 years when the Enquiry Commission submitted its report in 2016. It had clearly fixed the responsibility for the killing on Andrei Lugovi and Dmitry Kouvtun, both ex-KGB personnel who were colleagues of Litvinenko. Prime Minister Theresa May however, reacted much more sharply to the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter by expelling 23 Russian diplomats and freezing all Russian assets in the UK. More than 20 European allies expelled over 100 Russian diplomats and officials in solidarity with UK. Theresa May told the House of Commons that this was “the largest collective expulsion of Russian Intelligence officers in history”. Such was the European anger against Russia’s brazen methods of eliminating its traitors. The US too followed suit and expelled about 60 Russian diplomats under the Magnitsky Act, though it stopped short of making a formal determination that it had broken international law. The Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act signed by President Obama in December 2012, was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of a Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison in October 2009. In 2016, the bill was extended globally and authorised the US government to punish human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the US. Even as he announced expulsion of Russian diplomats, President Trump appeared as if he was being forced to take the decision under pressure from the ‘Deep State’, as it went against his deep-rooted desire to build a warm personal relationship with Putin. Only Germany took the matter forward by announcing a freeze on arms sale to Saudi Arabia, while questions hung over Khashoggi’s killing, and asked other European nations to follow the lead. Of all the reactions, President Trump’s reaction is the most genuine one, as he makes no bones as to where America’s interests lie. He has clearly refused to listen to the tape handed over by Turkey, nor has he agreed with the assessment made by the CIA that the murder of Khashoggi was ordered by none other than Mohammed bin Salman himself. Trump’s simple argument is that USD 110 billion of arms deal with Saudi Arabia is at stake, and thousands of jobs in the US are at stake. Again it is the ‘Deep State’ (the military – industrial complex) that is guiding President Trump. Trump is all deviance, sans morality. And he sports his deviance like a badge of honour dedicated to a higher cause – ‘America First’. No human rights, no rule of law can supersede that. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Tridivesh Singh Maini,"Even in the midst of tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad, certain links do remain intact – such as religious pilgrimages by the Sikhs to their holy shrines in Pakistan (of course, if relations were harmonious the number of pilgrims visiting Pakistan would be higher). The Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi recently issued 3,800 visas for Sikh pilgrims wanting to visit Pakistan to pay obeisance at Sikh shrines on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev (the first Guru of the Sikhs) which happens to be on 23 November. A statement issued by the   highlighted the fact, that this is the largest number of visas issued in recent years to Sikh pilgrims. In 2019, Sikhs around the world will be commemorating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The Government of India as well as the Government of Punjab (India) have already listed some of the steps they are likely to take for commemoration (this includes a series of seminars, setting up of chairs at universities) Both sides are at a distance of less than 5 kilometres from each other. Through this corridor, Sikhs will get visa-free access to the historic shrine, and will save them the hassle of travelling all the way to Delhi to secure a visa. While Sidhu’s move to embrace Bajwa was criticised by many in India, including his own party men, he cited the commitment given by Pakistan’s army chief towards opening the religious corridor. This did not spare Sidhu from attacks, with many arguing that he had gone in his personal capacity, and being a minister in the Punjab government, he was in no position to raise the issue. In September 2018, a member of Imran’s Cabinet,   again stated, that irrespective of ties between both countries, Pakistan would open the religious corridor, since it is an issue which pertains to ordinary Sikhs. Later on, as tensions have increased due to repeated militant attacks in Kashmir, as well as the cancellation of talks between Foreign Ministers of India and Pakistan (on the sidelines of the UNGA), Islamabad stated, that the corridor could only go ahead,  The Government of India on its part, first stated that this corridor could only go ahead, if a formal request came from Pakistan, though sections of the security establishment have repeatedly put forward their apprehensions. Even when it seemed that the movement had got a fillip, a   underscored the concerns of intelligence agencies and the army. Congress Member of Parliament  during a visit to the Indian side of the border, stated, “Under the current political scenario, where Pakistani agencies are regularly beheading Indian soldiers, we cannot even think of taking such an initiative.” In spite of a less than enthusiastic New Delhi and an ambivalent Islamabad, activists on the Indian side as well as from the Punjab (Pakistan) Government have continued to raise demands for the religious corridor. In a letter to Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister of Punjab (India)   raised the issue, stating that this was of concern to Sikhs. He again took up the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs in November 2018. The Ministry of External Affairs responded by stating that it could not do anything, until it received a formal communication from the Pakistani side. The Government of India recently stated, that it would install a high powered telescope and a screen on the Indian side for a view of the Kartarpur shrine for the benefit of the pilgrims. There was no mention about the issue of the religious corridor. Tensions between both countries have always proven to be an obstacle in people to people linkages between both countries in general, and the two Punjabs in particular; this time it is the Kartarpur Corridor. It is a pity, considering Guru Nanak’s universal message of peace and co-existence. It is also sad, that most Sikhs who want to visit Kartarpur Sahib where the first Guru spent an important phase of his life, are far removed from the politics of the nation-states.

Ajai Sahni,"A great deal of speculative nonsense characterised commentary in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack at the Nirankari Bhawan in the Raja Sansi area of Amritsar, well before any meaningful investigative inputs were available. Unrelated intelligence feeds were plugged in to raise the bogey of Islamist terrorism, a much-favoured meme in the current environment where the demonisation of Muslims is a critical instrument of partisan political mobilisation. Zakir Musa and his Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind had come, with their purported Islamic State affiliations, to ‘extend’ his group’s influence into the Punjab. Such claims are undeterred by the fact that Musa and the tiny fragment of the Hizb-ul-Mujahiddeen that he has broken away with, is fighting for its barest survival in Kashmir with a handful of supporters, and is unlikely to harbour ambitions of extension beyond, at this juncture. But if it isn’t Musa, it must be the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). The movement of a group of JeM terrorists through Punjab and towards Delhi had put the State Police on Red Alert, and so it must be this group who, perhaps wandering by casually, decided to chuck a grenade at the hapless Nirankaris. The very obvious inference – to anyone loosely familiar with the broad trajectory of terrorism in Punjab – that the perpetrators were likely to be tied to a Khalistani formation, seemed entirely to escape the attention of ideologically blinded commentators, but this is what is now unsurprisingly emerging from official pronouncements in Punjab and out of the limited evidence currently available. The Nirankaris – regarded as deviants and blasphemers by the Khalistanis (and the Akalis) – have long been a favourite target of the extremists. Indeed, it is useful to recall that the 15-year nightmare of terrorism in Punjab commenced with the targeting of the Nirankaris by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his Damdami Taksal followers in 1978, culminating in the murder of the head of the sect, Satguru Gurbachan Singh, in April 1980. The one consistent element in the continuous efforts to revive Khalistani terrorism in Punjab has been the role of Pakistan’s ISI, and it is likely to be confirmed in the present case as well. For one thing, almost all major active Khalistani formations have a base in Pakistan and are openly supported by the Army’s intelligence wing. Prominent among these are the Babbar Khalsa International, the Khalistan Zindabad Force, the International Sikh Youth Federation, Dal Khalsa International, the Khalistan Commando Force – Panjwar and the Khalistan Tiger Force. Several past operations, as well as large numbers of arrests and seizures of weapons in Punjab over the years have been linked to these formations. Equally significantly, cells affiliated to these groups, as well as prominent overground Khalistani organisations across the world, receive support from the ISI and Pakistani diplomatic missions, and this was visible in the orchestration of the recent Referendum 2020 demonstration at Trafalgar Square, where potential participants from Pakistan were offered an all expenses paid four-day trip to London. The K-2 project, a plan to ‘unite’ Kashmiri and Khalistani terrorist formations, has been a long term effort on the part of the ISI, though the obvious ideological divergence between Islamist and Sikh fundamentalist terrorist formations have kept any real unity of purpose out of reach over the decades. Nevertheless, some limited operational cooperation has been evidenced in the past, and cannot be excluded in the present or future. Groups like JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba are fully owned enterprises of the ISI, and if told to support specific Khalistani operations, would do so. Such operational cooperation must remain a cause of concern for intelligence and enforcement agencies in the Punjab. The attack at the Nirankar Bhawan has also drawn the usual accusations of intelligence failure – and, of course, every terrorist success does, in some sense, indicate a failure of the intelligence system. However, in most cases it is only in our fantasies that we will be able to discover or predict the specifics of every potential attack to the levels of precision necessary for effective preventive action. It is useful to remind ourselves that the Raja Sansi attack would have taken little more than a few seconds to execute, and could, in fact, have occurred anywhere across Punjab. No country in the world can ever have a security apparatus that can prevent every such possibility. Indeed, numerous intelligence and enforcement successes over the past years elude public attention, since they are seldom reported, or at best, are reported as the arrests of ‘suspected terrorists’, and provoke little interest. The revival of Khalistani terrorism at a scale that threatens the state apparatus remains highly unlikely; the terrorists, however, backed by Pakistan’s state system and by elements in a wealthy diaspora, will ‘get lucky’ from time to time. Crucially, there is no scope for complacence in the face of any measure of terrorism, and no way to predict possible triggers of abrupt escalation. Some political sagacity – instead of the current proclivity to inflame the situation with partisan posturing – will be necessary if Punjab is not to be pushed into an escalatory cycle, however limited.

Ishadrita Lahiri," Abhishek Sharma and Vivek Gupta Robert Romawia Royte’s size betrays his larger-than-life personality. As he arrives for an interview with  at Aizawl’s Assam Rifles Ground, all eyes are on him. He notices the attention but chooses not to acknowledge it. Instead, he takes to helping the crew look for a “proper” place to conduct the interview. “It’s Roma-way Roy-te”, he enunciates upon being asked the pronunciation of his name. “People just call me ‘RRR’ or ‘Triple’ R”,” he adds with a chuckle. On that note, we begin the interview. Known across the affluent circles of Aizawl as a well-off but helpful man, Royte is the promoter of Aizawl FC – the football club which made history by winning the I-League in 2017. Their rag to riches story became a talking point in the national media and a matter of much celebration in Aizawl. “It was like India had won the World Cup”, said Zuala, a local driver, describing the celebrations. Royte, now, wants to take his passion forward from football. And so, in the upcoming state election due on 28 November, he is contesting as Mizo Nation Front’s candidate for the Aizawl East (II) constituency. Royte’s inclination towards politics comes from his experience as a promoter for the football club. He joined the Mizo Nation Front – the principal opposition to the ruling Congress in the state – in September 2018. “Mizoram has no sports policy”, he says. “It makes it very difficult for a promoter or sportspersons to be incentivised to invest in sports, or take it up as a full time career.” Royte trails off to talk about the kind of boys who come to play for Aizawl FC. Young boys, of about 14 to 15 years of age, who come from the rural areas of the state. “We don’t have the funds to arrange for residence and food for all of these boys. But it is their passion for the sport because of which they manage by staying with relatives and working part-time jobs”. There’s a world-class stadium that is underway, he says. “It is still seeing some legal and bureaucratic troubles. But once it’s done, maybe we’ll be able to house more people.” As we speak, a group of kids in school uniform take to the field. Many of them are young girls, passing around the ball or doing routine warm-up exercises. “Women in Mizoram are very interested in sports too”, Royte remarks. “Aizawl FC used to be the only club to participate in the National Women’s League at one point of time.” At this point of the interview, we challenge him to a rapid fire. “I will give you the name of a football player, and you tell me the name of a politician – in Mizoram or nationally – that you think is most similar to the said footballer. Shall we start?” “Yes, please.” Royte agrees. “First – Cristiano Ronaldo.” He thinks for a bit and then says, “I have a name in mind but it is not prudent to say it in front of the media.” After refusing to respond to a few more names, he finally adds, “RRR will be the Cristiano Ronaldo of Mizoram politics.” “Just like Aizawl FC came out of nowhere to win the I-League, I will come out of nowhere to take politics by storm,” he adds confidently. With that, he walks off to greet the starry-eyed school kids waiting to take a picture with him. He also passes a few balls with them. After that, he leaves – his exit grabbing as many eyeballs as his entry. One of the schoolgirls comes up to us and asks, “Miss, are you friends with Mr Royte? Can you please give me his number? He’s a star!” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Thousands of devotees thronged the temple town of Ayodhya on Sunday, 25 November, to attend VHP's marathon 'Dharam Sabha' for discussing the construction of a Ram Temple there, with a senior religious leader asserting that the date would be announced early next year. Addressing the sabha after the inauguration marked by chanting of mantras at the Badey Bhaktmaal ki Bagia, Ramji Das of Nirmohi Akhara said, “The date for construction of the Ram temple will be declared in the 2019 Kumbh, which will be held in Prayagraj”. ""It is only a matter of a few days, and I request you all to show some patience,"" the seer remarked. While bhajans of Lord Ram played at different places all along the route, the involvement of some Muslims led by member of Ayodhya Zila Panchayat, Babloo Khan, who has been linked to the movement since the past three years, emphasised the composite culture of the town. “I have been associated with the Ram temple movement for last 3 years, and I feel that even the Muslims of Ayodhya want a Ram temple should be built. I am a Muslim, and I am welcoming the Ram devotees,” Khan told PTI. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad claimed over 3 lakh people attended the congregation as devotees from all walks of life descended here to discuss the way forward for building the temple. Senior VHP leader Champat Rai declared that no formula dividing the disputed land will be acceptable for temple construction at Ayodhya. ""We want the entire land for temple construction... no formula dividing the land is acceptable,"" he told the Dharam Sabha. Though Rai did not spell out the details, his assertions are considered to be in reference to the Allahabad High court verdict dividing the land into three parts. Nritya Gopaldas, the president of the Ram Janmbhoomi Nyas said, ""such a large attendance shows that how much people from different walks of life are attached to the Ram temple. ""We respect the courts. We have great hopes from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. I request Adityanath to pave the way for construction of Ram temple,"" he said. The religious congregation which lasted for nearly five hours saw around 50 seers from different ashrams and akhadas taking part in the religious meeting. Saints from Haridwar, Chhattisgarh, Hrisikesh, Ujjain, Gujarat, Chitraoot, Prayagraj and Lucknow attended the congregation, said Mahant Ramdas of Nirmohi Akhada of Ayodhya. Slogans of ‘ ' and ‘ ' could be heard from various corners of the programme venue and also on the stretch of the road leading to it. Senior religous leader Ram Bhadracharya claimed he had met a senior minister on Friday with regard to construction of the temple. ""On 23 November, I had called a senior union minister who assured that after the model code of conduct comes to an end on 11 December, the Prime Minister is likely to sit with them and take such a decision so that Ram temple could be built,"" he told the gathering.

Large hoardings of Mahanat Avaidyanath (guru of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath), Mahant Ramchandra Das and VHP stalwart Ashok Singhal dotted the place. Babloo had installed a flower petal showering machine to welcome the devotees on the way to programme venue. A model of the proposed Ram temple was also displayed at the venue. Elaborate arrangements including for food and medical facilities were made on the occasion, with the  of the BJP setting up camp and providing medicines for the needy. Days ago, the BJP's youth wing had come out with ‘Ram Dhun’, a one-minute devotional song that can be downloaded as a ringtone in mobile phones by devotees, with a view to garner support for construction of Ram temple. The All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM), an umbrella body of more than a dozen Muslim religious and social organisations, has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his urgent intervention into the developments in Ayodhya. VHP's Dharam Sabha is being touted as the largest congregation of 'Ram bhakts' in Ayodhya since the 1992 'kar seva' and it took place less than two weeks ahead of the 26th anniversary of the demolition of the 16th century Babri Mosque, that had triggered unrest in this pilgirm town and riots in other parts of India. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said he disapproved of the Shiv Sena's push for constructing a Ram temple here, saying the party had no role in the temple movement. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who arrived here ahead of the rally, on Saturday asked the Modi governent to wake up from a ""Kumbhakarna-like slumber"" and declare the date for the temple's construction.

The Congress, meanwhile said that all the parties have gone to Ayodhya only because the general elections are due next year. “Everyone's going there due to elections. Who stopped Uddhav Thackeray from going there in past 4-5 yrs? On one hand, they're friends with BJP and on the other they want to tell people they're interested in constructing Ram Temple and are pressurising the government.

The Quint,"Performer and music academician Swarnamalya, who has been at the forefront of the #MeToo movement in Carnatic music and also vocal about her support to those who called out lyricist Vairmuthu for alleged sexual harassment, says that she has been dropped from an event being held by the Sahitya Akademi in Coimbatore on 11 and 12 December, after initially being invited for it. While Swarnamalya says that she has been given no reason as to why those who invited her changed their minds, she believes it could be because she has been vocal on several controversial issues, including the recent MeToo movement. Representatives of the Sahitya Akademi say that she was never officially invited in the first place. After a delayed start, work on the pedestrian plaza in T Nagar — a Smart City project — picked up pace. But the recent spells of rain have exposed the lack of planning, putting road users to inconvenience. Pedestrians have started complaining to the civic body about water stagnation in the huge pits dug up for the pedestrian plaza, along several sections of Thyagaraya Road. For instance, a huge pit dug up for the project has led to traffic congestion near Hotel Residency Towers. “Vehicles are unable to turn at the junction. Pedestrians are walking on the road,” said a police constable. “At least 25 km of roads have been tendered out for street design. GN Chetty, Boag Road and Usman Road will have street designs with parking management. A total of 500 parking slots will be identified,” said a civic official. On Saturday, 24 November, Minister for Tamil culture, 'Ma Foi' K Pandiarajan, said that the government will not allow a 'derogatory and slanderous' conference organised by the St Joseph’s College in Tiruchi to discuss violence of women as portrayed in Tamil literature, to be conducted. Though the government claims the move is to protect Tamil culture, many have questioned whether this was just another attempt to clamp down on the freedom of speech and expression of academia. The international seminar on ‘Harassment of women as registered in Tamil literature’  announced by the Tamil department of the college was set to be held on 6 and 7 December. According to a brochure, it sought to address the gender imbalance that prevails in society from Vedic times. A traffic police inspector was shifted to the Armed Reserve wing after a video of him pulling down a traffic constable from a moving bike in Alwarpet went viral on Saturday, 24 November. Dharuman, a constable to the Teynampet traffic enforcement wing, went on a rant over his walkie-talkie. He claimed that his superior did not grant him leave to attend a ceremony following his mother’s death. She had passed away on 6 November and he had taken a few days’ leave. Following the incident, the constable was placed under suspension. On Friday, CCTV footage from the CV Raman Road junction in Alwarpet showed Teynampet traffic police inspector Ravichandran run to the middle of the road and pull down Dharuman from the moving bike. The bike slid under a mini-van and luckily, the constable was not caught under its wheels. After receiving numerous complaints, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) has formed a special team to curb transgender people from troubling passengers in the suburban trains in the city. The special team would conduct drives in various suburban sections to prevent harassment being meted out to commuters by transgender people seeking money, a senior RPF official said. The special drive, to be jointly conducted with the Government Railway Police (GRP), will have police inspecting the suburban trains on the four sections daily. The RPF official said that complaints were being received from commuters about the abusive behaviour of transgender people when passengers do not give them money, especially on the mass rapid transit system (MRTS) and Chennai Beach-Tambaram section.

Sanjana Ray,"Mohd Irshad Alam Voting for Mizoram’s 40-member state Assembly is almost around the corner, with the polls commencing on 28 November. The three main contenders for the seats – the Congress under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla that is currently in rule; a regional party named Mizo National Front (MNF), who have been giving the Congress a run for its money since Mizoram became a state in 1987 and the BJP, which surprisingly doesn’t have much of a stronghold in the state. These elections are an important run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, as Mizoram is the only state out of the eight making up the north-east, where the BJP is not in control – individually or in any form of alliance. While the Congress has been in power in Mizoram since a decade ago, it was the MNF which had formed the first independent state government, when it won 24 seats out of 40 in the 1987 elections, and had its leader, Laldegna, swear in as the state’s first Chief Minister. From 1987 to 2008, the MNF remained in power, although the vote-share differences between the Congress and MNF had started decreasing through the years, as the Congress started catching up with the latter, in terms of mass popularity. In 2013, the Congress under Lalthanhawla emerged victorious again, winning 34 seats, while the MNF, now sidelined, won only five seats. The BJP, again, did not win any seats. The Congress and the MNF have made it a point to present the BJP as an “anti-Christian” party, as a result of which it has never quite managed to gain a stronghold in the predominantly Christian state, PTI reported. The BJP, however, is looking at new ways by which it can enter as an equal contender in the fight. It has been pushing for the repatriation of the exiled Bru refugees, who fled the state for Tripura, back in 1997, following an outbreak of ethnic clashes against them. Another option that the BJP has is to tie-up an alliance with one of the major parties in the state – either the Congress or the MNF. However, while both parties have allied with the BJP at some point in the past, they have loudly proclaimed that they will be contesting the November elections by themselves, PTI reported. With the parties denying any kind of tie-up with one another, and instead, dissing one another’s chances in the upcoming polls, it remains to be seen who will emerge the victor. The results of the Mizoram elections, will be announced on 11 December. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Claiming to have cracked the case, police say they have arrested seven juveniles including the 17-year-old brother of Shankar’s girlfriend, in connection with the crime. On Tuesday morning, Shankar’s body was found on the banks of the Thamirabarani river near Vellanguli, Tirunelveli with a fatal wound inflicted by a knife on his neck. An employee of Tirunelveli District Central Cooperative Bank, Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath in the river. The 17-year-old brother is the main accused in the crime, say police.  Speaking to TNM about the case, Ambasamudram DSP Zaheer Hussain said that despite the girl’s parents agreeing to the wedding between Esakki and Sathyabama, her younger brother was unhappy with his sister’s relationship with a man from a different caste. “The boy knew that Esakki goes to take bath in the river every morning. So on Tuesday, he and his friends followed Esakki and attacked him with a knife. There were six cuts on Esakki’s body. Although Sathyabama’s parents did not believe that the boy would have killed Esakki, later he himself confessed in front of his family that he murdered Esakki,” the DSP added. “Esakki belonged to the Konar community (OBC) and we are hearing that he and a young woman from his neighborhood were in love.

Manasa Rao,"A week after singer Chinmayi was expelled from the South Indian Cine, Television Artistes and Dubbing Artistes Union, she has given clarifications on allegations that she had not paid her membership fee to the body. In a 19-minute video published on her YouTube page, Chinmayi said that she had, in fact, paid a lifetime membership fee of Rs 5,000, in excess of the prescribed amount. “Their telling me that my membership automatically expired because I did not pay the subscription fee is false. Because I have paid the lifetime membership fee,” she says. “In 2006, February 11, I have a bank transfer that has gone out to the dubbing union for the payment of a lifetime membership fee. It is pegged at Rs 2,500 in the by-law book which is in Tamil. But they asked me to pay Rs 5,000 and I paid it. They have not given me a receipt for it. One week later, they have also released a payment for a film that I had dubbed for, after reducing 10 percent.” Chinmayi admits that neither the union nor she, followed up to get a receipt for the payment. As part of the MeToo movement, Chinmayi had lent her support to women who had spoken out against alleged harassment by veteran actor Radha Ravi who heads the union. Chinmayi had also accused Tamil lyricist Vairamuthu of sexual misconduct, leading to much debate in the Tamil film industry. The singer had come under huge pressure and many people within and outside the industry targeted her. In the video, Chinmayi adds that in March this year, the dubbing union had released a list of 97 members, including her, who would not be eligible to vote in the General Body elections as they had not paid the membership fee of Rs 180. However, she points out that only her membership had been terminated. Soon after she announced on Twitter that her membership had been axed by the dubbing union, Radha Ravi told TNM that the singer was only allowed to continue dubbing because she was popular. This did not, however, stop the union from continuing to take their cut. ""Chinmayi was not allowed to vote this time during the dubbing union elections because she is not a member of the union. Judge Vasuki, who oversaw the elections, told us she cannot be a member since she has not been paying her membership fee. I don’t know how things were run two years ago, I've just come to power. For the past two years, she had been exempted and allowed to dub only because she's a well-known artiste,” Radha Ravi had  . Further explaining that the the dubbing union takes a 10 percent cut off an artiste’s salary, Chinmayi was reportedly informed that while half of it goes to the dubbing in-charge-cum-PRO who manages the artistes, the other half goes to the dubbing union welfare fund. The last film that Chinmayi dubbed for was the superhit 96 which released in October 2018.

Raghav Bahl,"A week is a long time in politics, or so goes the cliché. But as the previous week showed, it’s also   time to prove how dramatically India’s politics has changed since Prime Minister Modi took power. Finally, 2014’s extraordinary general election created sharp edges around India’s democratic institutions. It’s now clear, with the wisdom of hindsight, that 2014 smashed India’s centrist consensus, injecting an avowedly right-wing government in office. Until then, it was thought that India would only   left or right, but stay within a circumference of centrist, moderate ideologies. However, the Modi government has now decisively aborted centrist politics. I say this as a matter of fact, without passing any value judgement. Since it won democratically, it has used its mandate to begin building a majoritarian edifice. It has expanded the state, nationalising a spectrum of free market institutions, from the pricing of pharmaceuticals and sports rights to oil. It aggressively conflates the political party with the government and ultimately with the nation. So if you are either against the BJP or its government, you are damned as being “anti-national”. It mocks the language of moderation as weak pacifism. It treats ideological opponents as “enemies” who should be neutralized – casually charging them with treason, calling them traitors – instead of looking upon them as adversaries who need to be intellectually vanquished. It wants to reconfigure institutional structures that are seen as too soft and accommodating. Just see how three events rammed home this hard reality, altering the chemistry of democratic conventions in the wink of a week! In 2015, the Modi government made a bold political departure from its hardline attitude towards J&K. It created a coalition with the “soft separatist” PDP of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. People applauded, convinced that Modi had sued for peace. It was the season of hope and reconciliation, both proving ephemeral. The coalition collapsed in a welter of acrimony, and Modi reverted to his jack-boot policy on J&K. Alarmed, Modi’s three opponents – PDP, National Conference and Congress – quickly buried their mutual animosity to cobble a strong majority of 50+ in a house of 90 members. By all democratic canons, the new coalition   to be invited to form the government. But the governor brazenly played truant. He switched off his fax machine, and waited for a good eight hours until he had spoken with the rulers in Delhi. His instructions were clear. Dissolve the house. And he did that instantly, trampling over every legislative convention. It was a suicidal moment to indulge in petty, muscular politics. But right-wing ideological pressure had triggered an executive/legislature explosion; a delicate consensus was violated. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) autonomy used to be an article of faith. But the Modi government wanted to influence it politically. It wanted to mitigate the hardships that demonetisation, GST and slow economic growth had heaped on small businesses. It also wanted failed public sector banks to restart lending, but that would have required fresh capital. Ideally, the government should have used its fiscal book to achieve these objectives. But its budgetary arithmetic was fragile. So it simply threatened to use Section 7 of the RBI Act, which would have   RBI to do its bidding. Such a coercive use of the law would have been unprecedented. Now, while pointing this legal gun, its hand-picked board nominees browbeat the central bank into submission. The governor relented, and gave a few concessions. The regime pulled back on other demands by a few weeks, until the next meeting in mid-December. It’s an uneasy truce, but the regime has drawn the first blood. The CBI fiasco could challenge even the most imaginative authors of spy thrillers. The regime sent in its armed guards at midnight, installing a new chief, sacking the feuding top cops, raiding their offices and snooping into their gadgets and files! The next day, the sacked officers approached the Supreme Court and filed all kinds of petitions against the state and each other. A harried court tried to grapple with this extraordinary situation. It ordered a court-monitored enquiry into the allegations against the CBI Chief. But one of his responses got leaked. The court flew into a rage. Did the court then infringe a cardinal principle of jurisprudence by   guilt?  Because while the leak could have happened at any point in the chain – including from the defendant’s keyboard operator or the court’s clerks – the bench assumed that the CBI Chief had committed a breach of trust. Clearly, the judges were, somewhat understandably, unsettled by the unusual circumstances; so they overlooked what they had once advocated, that “noisy” journalists are the lifeblood of a democracy. But in the current context, they took great umbrage against the pesky, irreverent news portal that had dared to publish the “unprintable” stuff. To be fair to the Modi regime, while its methods are questionable and extreme, its tools are “democratic”. After all, it did win a historic mandate in 2014; and Prime Minister Modi is using that to graft a new ideological skin on India’s political democracy. To peel away that skin, his opponents   to create a counter narrative that appeals to the electorate, thereby wresting the political mandate. In the ultimate analysis, Modi’s opponents cannot be squeamish, simply crying foul. They will have to mount a vigorous and energetic   response. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Modi’s reply came while he was addressing a rally in Chhatarpur. In an apparent dig at UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, he also said 125 crore people of the country were the ""high command"" of his government, which was ""not remote-controlled by a madam."" Attacking Gandhi, Modi said that ""coffers of banks were emptied for the rich during the madam's government. However, our government opened doors of banks for the needy youth."" The prime minister asked why the Congress was worried about Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan being called ""mama."" He said the Congress was voted out of power in Madhya Pradesh 15 years ago because it indulged in the politics of divisiveness. Babbar’s remark led to both the BJP and his party chief Rahul Gandhi calling for an apology. The rupee has seen a continuous fall against the US dollar this year, hovering a little over the 70-mark on Friday, 23 November. Modi's mother Hirabai is a nonagenarian. Babbar made the controversial remark while addressing a rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh's Indore city on Thursday. MP goes to polls on 28 November. ""(Before becoming the prime minister) Modi used to say that compared to the (US) dollar, the value of the rupee has fallen to a level where it is almost the same as the age of the then Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh),"" Babbar, the Uttar Pradesh Congress chief, said. BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said it was not proper to use unparliamentary words or drag any person's mother into politics. ""But the Congress' attitude against the prime minister's mother has been improper from the beginning and such language was used even against the prime minister,"" he claimed.

"Sreedevi Jayarajan, The News Minute","Missionaries of Jesus, that has been consistently supporting rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal, has once again failed the survivor nun. This time, the congregation that is a part of the Jalandhar diocese, has asked the police to shift the survivor and 5 witnesses away from the convent. The congregation has disagreed to implement certain security measures, claiming that they did not have the money for it. In a letter written to the police, which TNM has accessed, the Mother Superior General of the convent, Sister Regina, has said that it would be ideal to shift the survivor and the witness nuns to a secure government facility, as the convent would not be able to provide additional security for them. The issue dates back to October 27, 2018, when the Kuruvilangad sub-inspector wrote to Sister Regina, asking her to increase security measures at the convent. In his letter, the officer added a list of security measures and spoke about the death of Father Kuriakose in Jalandhar. ""Under this circumstance where controversies surrounding the death of the main witness of the case Fr Kuriakose of Jalandhar diocese have been circulating, upgrading the security of the survivor, the witnesses and the St Francis Mission home is an immediate requirement,” the letter said. The requirements included CCTV cameras in the entry and exit gates, street lights from the main road leading up to the convent, grills over wells, proper lighting in the terrace and cuting of big trees in the compound, so branches won’t block vision. The officer also asked the convent to give a spare key of the exit door to the survivor, to maintain a registry with all details of the residents and to have a separate cook for the six nuns. Within three days, the Mother Superior General, responded stating that the convent did not have the 'financial capabilities' or the power to execute these arrangements. ""It is of utmost necessity to ensure the privacy, security of the nuns and other residents of the mission home and provide them with a tranquil environment. The convent does not possess the financial capacity and power to carry out the measures you have listed out for the additional security of the survivor nuns and the witnesses. Some of the security measures listed in the letter will also affect the day to day working of the mission home, the privacy as well as safety of the nuns and other residents of the home,” was the response. Adding that the security of the survivor nun and the witnesses was of utmost importance, Sister Regina said, “If you think there is a threat to the complainant and the other nuns who are witnesses in this case, I believe it would be ideal to shift them to a secure government facility to ensure their safety.

Further, Sr Anupama said that most security measures listed in the letter were not difficult to implement. ""There are already six CCTV cameras installed in the convent. Only two are working and the other four stopped working due to rains and thunder. Apart from this, there were only some small arrangements that were asked to be made. The excuse that they have no money is a blatant lie. Just sometime back, 14 nuns were flown to Delhi so that they could campaign for Bishop Franco,"" she added. It must also be noted that Franco had a battery of lawyers, including a senior lawyer representing him at court, all paid for by the diocese. “We feel a bit scared to eat from the convent. The list of security measures were sent after consulting us and inspecting the convent,"" Anupama said. The Thrissur arch diocese of the Catholic Church celebrated Father Franco by putting his photograph on their annual Catholic calendar issued by the church.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed against the preventive detention of an accused in the case of smuggling rice allotted for distribution under the PDS scheme. “It is brought to the notice of this court that for 2017-18, Rs 2,110 crore has been spent for distribution of free rice. ₹2,110 crore is a huge amount, which should be spent judiciously including for infrastructure building.

PTI,"Noting that there is disillusionment with governance and functioning of institutions, former president Pranab Mukherjee said they are a mirror of national character and must immediately win back the people's trust to save India's democracy. Mukherjee, who was speaking at the inauguration of a national conference on ""Towards Peace, Harmony and Happiness: Transition to transformation"", stressed the need for maintaining the delicate balance of power between institutions and the state, as provided in the Constitution. Correctives, he said, have to come from within these institutions to restore their credibility. ""Our Constitution provides a delicate balance of power between various institutions of the state. This balance has to be maintained,"" he said at the event organised by Pranab Mukherjee Foundation and the Centre for Research in Rural Development (CRRID). In the last 70 years, the former president said, the country has established a successful parliamentary democracy, an independent judiciary and strong institutions such as the Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General, Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Information Commission that sustain and support our democratic structure. The country needs a Parliament that debates, discusses and decides, and not disrupt, a judiciary that gives justice without delay and a leadership that is committed to the nation and those values that made us a great civilization, Mukherjee asserted. ""In the recent past, these institutions have come under severe strain and their credibility is being questioned. There is widespread cynicism and disillusionment with the governance and functioning of these institutions. To restore this credibility, the correctives have to come from within,” he added. His remarks come in the wake of the recent strain between the RBI and the government. In Mukherjee's view, peace and harmony prevail when a nation celebrates pluralism, practices tolerance and promotes goodwill among diverse communities. ""The land which gave the world the concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one) and the civilisational ethos of tolerance, acceptance, and forgiveness, is now in the news for rising levels of intolerance, manifestations of rage and infringement of human rights,"" he added. Peace and harmony, he asserted, prevail when the toxins of hatred, envy, jealousy and aggression are purged from our everyday lives. According to the former president, for peaceful and harmonious social transformation, society must have the capacity to meet the basic human needs of its citizens, establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their lives and create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential. ""Where people are largely dependent on the governments for basic amenities, good governance has a vital role to play in such transformation,"" he said. Mukherjee said the conference is being held at a time when the country is passing through a ""difficult phase"" with newspaper headlines a painful and a distressing experience as they only highlight violence, anger and hatred. An inclusive public policy with poor implementation is of little value to society and the nation and the country's bureaucratic system ""tends to work in silos leading to poor coordination and lack of teamwork"", he said. While policy formulation is critical, it is essential to pay focussed attention to policy implementation, he said. ""In the light of these facts, we all - the politicians, the academicians, the thought leaders, the opinion makers, the intellectuals and the civil society have to work together, to carve-out the path for a violence free transformation of the society towards peace, harmony and happiness,"" Mukherjee said. Former Union minister and BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi also spoke on the occasion, stressing on the transformation towards creating a peaceful, harmonious and happy society. He said the ""world is one"" and the concept of holistic universe where science and spirituality converge can lead to a better understanding of human relationships and goals of creating a peaceful, egalitarian, inclusive, non-violent and progressive world.

Addressing the gathering in Medchal, Hyderabad, Sonia Gandhi said that the Congress-led UPA decided to create a separate state of Telangana for the welfare of the people – despite knowing that they will face a setback if they do so. Recalling the Andhra Pradesh bifurcation, Sonia said, ""I remember how much difficulty we faced during state bifurcation. It wasn't achieved easily.

This is the second time that the ED is carrying out a search at Chowdary’s properties in less than a month. According to reports, the ED team from Chennai, launched a raid at the offices of the MP on Friday night and continued their search well into Saturday. Officials searched Chowdary’s offices located in Punjagutta and in Jubilee Hills. According to local news reports, the officials have seized several documents from his offices. Chowdary allegedly took a loan of Rs 304 crore from three banks and transferred them to shell companies, without paying back the loan. He also has three cases against him filed by CBI. Sujana Chowdary was a Union Minister holding the portfolio of Science and Technology until recently, before the TDP pulled out of the NDA in March, citing the Centre’s denial of Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh. On October 10, the ED, had for the first time, raided Chowdary’s offices in Hyderabad. Following this, his colleague CM Ramesh, a member of Political Affairs Committee (PAC) had sought an explanation from the Income Tax Department on the searches against the TDP leaders. Almost a week later, the IT conducted raids against Ramesh, after which he hit out at the IT Department and accused the BJP of playing ‘vindictive’ politics for his protest against the Centre.

Maanvi,"Brahminical patriarchy. Two words which sparked a huge debate everywhere, when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was seen holding a placard with the words ""Smash Brahminical Patriarchy"" in a photo posted on – yes, you guessed it – Twitter. But what do these two words mean? Who wants to smash it? And why is everyone angry? Take these two words separately. Brahminical and patriarchy. One means a need to maintain caste purity in society. The other, a need to control women. Combine these two and you get a basic understanding of the term. According to a 1993 essay by Uma Chakravarti, the term means ""the need for effective sexual control over women to maintain not only patrilineal succession but also caste purity."" One term which seeks to maintain both the oppressive caste system and the oppressive patriarchal system. Got it. Everywhere, really. On 2 November 2018, a 45-year-old Dalit woman in Rajkot was slapped by an upper caste man when she went to fetch water at a borewell. The upper caste man wanted to wash his jeep, the woman told him to wait his turn, and she got assaulted. That's brahminical patriarchy in action. It's even worse, when you hear cases of Dalit women being raped or killed. According to this system, you're liable to violence because you're a Dalit, and you're a woman. And keeping you in place is the way the caste system and patriarchy will live on. Well, yes. Brahminical patriarchy is not a new term in Dalit or feminist literature. It's been researched, written about and protested against for years. Most notably by BR Ambedkar. In ‘Against the Madness of Manu: BR Ambedkar’s writings on Brahminical Patriarchy,’ Sharmila Rege writes that ""Ambedkar saw caste’s exclusionary violence and subjugation of women inherent in the very processes that lead to caste formation."" And the most powerful way BR Ambedkar proposed that Brahminical patriarchy can be smashed is inter-caste marriage. Yes, a woman's freedom to marry outside her caste ends the power wielded by the upper-castes to oppress and further maintain the caste system. This is why most reports of caste-based violence are centred around inter-caste marriages where a Dalit man marries an upper-caste woman. That's brahminical patriarchy for you. So, if you now see “boycott Twitter” calls or just general outrage, pause and explain to them what brahminical patriarchy means. It's not just an academic term, it's all around us. And maybe it is indeed high time to smash it. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Yadav, who is serving jail term in fodder scam cases, is currently lodged at a paying ward of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi. His condition had deteriorated on 18 November due to a festering boil on his right leg. The former Bihar chief minister’s dose of insulin had been increased to bring down the sudden increase in sugar level on Sunday. The doctor had said Yadav’s creatinine level also increased to 1.85 from 1.5 and so did the while blood cell count to 12,000, the normal range of which is between 4,000 and 8,000. Due to the boil, Yadav was experiencing difficulty in standing up and going to the washroom, sources close to him said. Convicted in the Rs 900-crore fodder scam, the RJD chief surrendered before a special CBI court in late August, following the Jharkhand High Court’s refusal to extend his bail on medical grounds. He was admitted to the RIMS and later shifted to its paying ward after he complained that he could not sleep properly due to the barking of dogs and the mosquito menace. The fodder scam is related to fraudulent withdrawal of government funds from the treasuries of various districts of undivided Bihar in the 1990s when the RJD was in power and Yadav the chief minister. Yadav was in Ranchi jail since December last year in fodder scam cases. The Jharkhand High Court had first provided him bail for specialised treatment in hospitals in various states and again in July to attend the wedding of his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav in Patna.

Yashwant Deshmukh,"It started with a fun-tweet at my end, joking with Prof Yogenadra Yadav that he doesn’t take   numbers seriously. I interjected in a conversation between Dr Sanjay Kumar of CSDS and Prof Yadav. Dr Sanjay disagrees with Prof Yadav in his assessment (or rather assertion) that BJP’s fortunes are taking a nosedive in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Shekhar Gupta, in the “spirit of healthy disagreement”, asked for a debate between “two brilliant psephologists” aiming for a   and   conversation. Now, the only way to get myself counted among the greats, was to jostle in, to bask in the reflected glory of great minds, ones that I deeply respect. Shekhar ji, being a gentleman, amicably replied, and I wasn’t going to let go of this opportunity. The recent CVoter Tracker in MP/Chhattisgarh/Rajasthan shows similar voting trends like the CSDS surveys, with some differences in seat share projections. In MP/Chhattisgarh seat share projections the CVoter tracker is projecting a slender Congress lead, and a massive Congress sweep in Rajasthan. This is understandable as the vote shares in both studies are within close range, and the FPTP (first past the post) system inherently does not have any direct correlation of votes polled and seats won by any party. The thumb rule says, the party with more votes will get more seats, but in FPTP, even that rule goes for a toss. However, when the difference in assessments between poll pundits is not a marginal one, it sure calls for a detailed dissection to ascertain if we are talking about the same universe. In that light, this debate is important and interesting. To cut a long story short, you can read the full analysis by Yogendra Yadav on “Why BJP is staring at a loss of nearly 100 seats from 2014 tally”  . When what started as a joke became serious (during my Twitter “intervention”), I said I am game. Yadav replied: “Great. So, for clarity’s sake, can we break the dialogue into 4 Qs: 1. Likely gains for BJP in the east followed by 2. Likely losses for BJP in west + south; 3. Likely losses for BJP in UP and finally 4. Likely losses for BJP in rest of Hindi belt. Feel free to change/challenge.” Yadav: The east offers the BJP its only growth possibility over 2014. It won 11 seats in this entire region and thus, has room to grow. All credible polls indicate that its support base is growing in Odisha at the expense of the Congress, and in Bengal at the expense of the Left Front. The only question is whether it can convert its additional votes into additional seats this election. As of now, the BJP appears to have crossed that threshold in Odisha, but not in Bengal. It may overtake the Left to emerge as the runner-up in Bengal, but it is still way short of challenging Mamata Banerjee’s hegemony. It cannot grow more in Assam but is likely to pick additional seats in the hill states of the northeast. All in all, the BJP may pick up to 20 additional seats from this region. (Yours Truly) Yashwant Deshmukh (YD): Agree with the observations. Our latest tracker this month shows a gain of 24 seats for the BJP in this region. Not far off from 20 additional seats that Yadav is indicating. For these detailed inputs, I am putting in all the updated data for each state in the east zone. Prof. Yadav has raised an extremely important point while stating that the BJP will be a force to reckon with in East India. He is absolutely correct in raising doubts that the massive upswing of votes for BJP in the eastern zone may not end in equally “massive” addition to its seats tally. This is very much possible. In May 2014, the NDA had polled just about 19 percent in this zone, and as of 16 November, our tracker data is indicating a massive 12 percent upswing, taking the BJP vote share to almost 36 percent in this zone. Classically, this upswing is not coming from the Congress kitty, which is retaining its approximately 19 percent vote share in this zone. A small portion of these votes is coming from NDA allies in NEDA, which constitutes only 11 out of total 88 seats in this region. These 11 seats in 7 northeast states have only about 8 percent votes of the entire eastern region. The remaining 92 percent electorate is spread across 3 major states, namely West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, where BJP has arguably conjured up a massive upswing. While in Assam and Tripura the BJP has formed a government on its own, the tracker data shows something extraordinary happening in Odisha and West Bengal. In Odisha the BJP is polling almost 38 percent at the moment, significantly above the ruling BJD’s 33 percent. Certainly, BJP looks set to cross the ‘threshold’ of votes to convert that into seats in Odisha. The state ruled by TMC is witnessing an extraordinary scenario, where CPI (M) and Congress are headed for a complete meltdown and their votes are polarising towards BJP, against Mamata Banerjee. So, the more bipolar it gets, the more likely it might end up helping TMC, simply because of arithmetic. Right now, the BJP is polling around 31 percent vote, while TMC is a full 10 points ahead with 41 percent votes. With further polarisation, it is very likely that Muslim voters in North Bengal would leave Congress and move to Mamata. The opposite would happen from Left Front towards the BJP. If the trend continues in this manner, they may finally settle for 35 percent for BJP and 45 percent for TMC. Yes, the BJP would become the principal opposition to Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, but will the 35 percent vote share result in seat conversion? Unlikely. I fully agree with Prof Yadav here that in West Bengal, even with the massive upswing of votes, the BJP might not cross the threshold. It didn’t look likely as of 16 November. Our algorithm converts these votes into approximately 9 out of 42 seats for BJP in West Bengal, but it is highly probable that BJP might end up with a big zero even with a possible 35 percent vote share. In a bipolar contest, a gap of 10 percent votes is way too big to counter. The TMC’s lead is not 10 percent across all the regions. We spotted this trend in the massive round of survey we did during the panchayat elections for Anandabazar Patrika, the highest-selling Bengali daily. From a mere 3 percent votes in 2013, the BJP shot to almost 27 percent votes during the panchayat elections, and the regional variations were staggering. The latest round of CVoter tracker only confirms that this trend has consolidated further. Look at the TMC leads over the BJP across different regions. They are as large as 21 percent in north border regions, and 13 percent in deltaic regions, but crash down to about 5 percent in northern hills and just about 2 percent in southern plains. And in the highlands, the tables have turned already and TMC is trailing by about 3 percent behind BJP. Yes, you guessed it right, it is the same region that comprises areas like Jhargram and Purulia, where the TMC is accusing the BJP of joining hands with Maoists for electoral gains. Just a couple of points swing from the Left Front to BJP in these areas, is bound to turn the tables. But if that doesn’t happen, then further polarisation of Muslim votes to TMC will increase the gap, and that would only mean just about 4 or 5 seats for BJP in the largest state of the east zone. Talking about probability, Mamata Banerjee could very well end up with a score line of 42-0 within the same vote share range. If the news about the sitting Congress MP from Malda, Mausam Noor joining the TMC gets confirmed, it will sound the final nail in the coffin for the West Bengal Congress unit. She is the niece of legendary Congress leader ABA Ghani Khan Choudhury, and it’s the Malda votes which form the majority of the 15 percent votes that Congress is picking up in the northern border region. Our data shows TMC leading in 7 out of total 8 seats in this region, and with Mausam Noor switching the sides, it will be 8-0 for TMC with well over 50 percent votes in this region. This episode of West Bengal precisely exposes the equation of TMC and BJP. It is in TMC’s interest that BJP grows in West Bengal at the expense of Left Front while TMC eats up the entire Congress support base. This ensures the complete TMC sweep as on today. However, as Prof. Yadav talked about the ‘threshold’, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this threshold has already been breached in one region and on the verge of being breached in two more major regions of West Bengal. If the TMC leadership thinks that their 10 percent lead over BJP is evenly distributed in entire state, they might be in for a rude shock. That shocker is just a 1 percent swing away in the southern plains and another 2.5 percent swing away in the northern hills, and at this moment, as many as 18 out of the 32 projected seats for TMC are coming from these two regions. Else, my current estimate of BJP gaining 24 seats in the eastern region is more or less the same as Yadav’s estimate of 20+ seats gain for the saffron party.

PTI,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, 22 November, said the Ram temple issue is raked up before every election, and wondered for how long people will be 'fooled' by the ' ' slogan. Thackeray said that during his visit to Ayodhya on 25 November, he would ""seek an answer"" to how many more elections would pass with people being ‘fooled’ by the slogan. Thackeray had announced during the Shiv Sena's Dussehra rally in Mumbai that he will visit Ayodhya on 25 November and ""question"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of the construction of the Ram temple. ""The soil where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born carries with it sentiments of all Hindus and collecting these sentiments will speed up the process of the construction of Ram temple,"" he said.

The Quint," Anubhav Mishra  Abhishek Sharma The war of words between Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leader Ram Madhav and National Conference’s Omar Abdullah continued on Thursday, 22 November, after the former challenged Abdullah to prove “genuine love” between NC and Mehbooba Mufti-led People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and fight the next elections together. Both political leaders sparred on Twitter after Madhav questioned Abdullah and Mehbooba’s wish to form a government in Jammu and Kashmir. Mehbooba Mufti too joined in later in the fracas, as she lashed out against Madhav over his ""Pakistan"" remark, saying that she was ""shocked to see baseless allegations against mainstream parties"" in Jammu and Kashmir. Madhav on Thursday stirred a fresh controversy by accusing National Conference’s (NC’s) Omar Abdullah and PDP President Mehbooba Mufti of coming together to form an alliance at the “behest of instructions from across the border.” Moments after Madhav’s accusation, Abdullah asked him to prove his accusation or apologise. “I dare you Ram Madhav ji to prove your allegation. You have RAW, NIA & IB at your command (CBI too is your parrot) so have the guts to place evidence in the public domain. Either prove this or be man enough to apologise. Don’t practice shoot & scoot politics,” Abdullah tweeted. After Abdullah’s demand, Madhav asked the former to take it in his stride, saying he didn’t mean to offend him. However, Abdullah wasn’t satisfied with the response. While slamming Madhav for his ""Pakistan"" remark, Mufti questioned if supporting the Centre was the sole criterion to become ""nationalistic and patriotic"", indicating that MLAs of PDP and NC were labelled ""anti-nationalistic"" just because they had ""enough integrity to stand up to your (BJP's) failed attempts of defection"". Madhav had accused the PDP and NC of coming together after “fresh instructions from across the border.” “PDP and NC boycotted local body polls last month because they had instructions from across the border. Probably they had fresh instructions from across the border to come together and form government. What they did prompted Governor to look into the whole issue,” Madhav said, charging at political rivals Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. Political tempers have shot up with Madhav’s accusation on Thursday morning. He said Mufti never claimed that she will form the government in her letter to the governor. “Only Governor can answer why his home's fax machine is not working. Only he should answer. But this is lame excuse on the part of Madam Mehbooba. In letter, she never claimed that she will form the government. She said I'll come see you and stake the claim. It was all a drama,” Madhav said. Jammu and Kashmir plunged into a political crisis on Wednesday when Governor Satya Pal Malik dissolved the Assembly after Mehbooba Mufti and People's Conference leader Sajjad Lone staked their respective claims to form the government in the state.

Zijah Sherwani,"Puneet Bhatia Abhay Sharma A photograph does many things at the same time. It provides evidence and dispenses justice, it captures history and sometimes says a lot more than what’s seen. Nobody knows this better than Praveen Jain, perhaps India’s most well-known photojournalist. He has been a photographer for over three decades now. From riots to earthquakes in India, from Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi, from the lathicharge on Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the BJP’s ascent to power, he has captured it all. Praveen even risked his life to capture the horrific Hashimpura massacre where 42 men were killed. Pictures he took of the incident were key evidence in the recent judgment which came 31 years after the killings. Praveen specialises in political mood photography. In almost every picture, we see the real person behind the garb of the politician. Some of his iconic pictures, like former Prime Minister Deve Gowda’s sleeping photo, took on national significance – it gave him the name 'the sleeping PM'. In fact, some leaders were so aware of Praveen’s presence that they had strict diktats. Former President KR Narayanan always had one message for Praveen Jain – “Don’t take ulta- pictures of me”. Most of Praveen’s photographs were clicked because of his personal rapport with the politicians or if Praveen saw potential in a rising politician. He shot pictures of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav when he was living in his brother's servants’ quarters. These pictures became a rage when Lalu became chief minister of Bihar. Praveen’s latest exhibition ‘200 and 1’ chronicles his journey of three decades as a political photographer. He comes from the film reel era where a photo couldn’t be viewed instantly – perhaps that’s what made him a more observant and better cameraperson. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"The very idea of a grand coalition in Jammu and Kashmir has given the BJP jitters, former chief minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said on Wednesday, 21 November, after the dissolution of the state Assembly by Governor Satya Pal Malik. The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was abruptly dissolved by the governor hours after the PDP staked claim to form a government with the backing of rival National Conference and the Congress, followed by another bid from the two-member People's Conference which claimed the support of the BJP and 18 legislators from other parties.

Nevertheless, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to @OmarAbdullah and @Ambikasoni4 ji for helping us achieve the seemingly impossible."" Former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the governor’s decision to dissolve the Assembly ""cannot be a coincidence"" as it came within minutes of Mehbooba Mufti staking claim to form the government. Minutes after Satya Pal Malik’s decision to dissolve the state Assembly, Abdullah tweeted: Former Finance Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram lashed out at Governor Malik and indicated that the Assembly was dissolved following the announcement of the ‘grand-coalition.’ Congress leader Manish Tewari termed the decision to dissolve the Assembly as ""unconstitutional, immoral and unethical"", adding that it was a ""murder of democracy.” Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Ghulam Nabi Azad said while the talks for formation of a popular government were in its infancy, the BJP government at the Centre was so worried that they dissolved the state assembly. ""It is clear that BJP's policy is either we or nobody,"" Azad told PTI. The BJP, on the other hand, said the best option in J&K is to have fresh Assembly polls at the earliest as it slammed the proposed alliance of opposition parties as a ""combination of terror-friendly parties"". Taking to Twitter, soon after the state governor dissolved the Assembly amid claims by rival formations on forming a government, the BJP said that the border state cannot afford horse-trading and instability keeping its security scenario in mind. ""The best option in such a scenario is to go in for a fresh election at the earliest. This assembly cannot produce a stable government,"" it added. J&K BJP President Ravinder Raina welcomed the decision taken by Governor Satya Pal Malik to dissolve the Assembly. “Once again, the NC, Congress and the PDP hatched a conspiracy in Jammu & Kashmir that would have done injustice to Jammu and Ladakh. Will they form alliance before elections,” questioned Raina. Veteran politician and Loktantri Janata Dal Chief Sharad Yadav on Thursday called the dissolution of the J&K Assembly a ""murder of democracy.” ""Democracy has been murdered in J&K by dissolving the assembly.

The seven-term Lok Sabha MP also criticised the government's decision to hold the urban and rural civic body polls in the state as, he said, the elections had been held without participation of the major political parties in the state. Yadav said the BJP neither cares for the Constitution nor does it have any respect for various institutions of the country.

Poonam Agarwal,"The DIG CBI Manish Kumar Sinha’s petition in the Supreme Court on 18 November not only opened a can of worms, but also raised the issue of privacy and illegal phone tapping. In his petition, Sinha alleged instances of top officials, right from the National Security Advisor, to the MoS for Coal, to the Union Law Secretary, intervening in the ongoing bribery investigation against the CBI’s Special Director Rakesh Asthana. Sinha and CBI’s Deputy SP AK Bassi mentioned in their petition a series of telephonic conversations between senior officials in the government. In one of the conversations, the Special Secretary R&AW, Samant Goel, allegedly told Somesh, the middleman, “Do not come to India at any cost” Sinha’s petition also mentioned that “The NSA informed the Special Director CBI Rakesh Asthana about registration of FIR” on 17 October. In return “Rakesh Asthana reportedly made a request to NSA that he should not be arrested”.  spoke to former senior CBI officers and Ministry of Home Affairs officers on condition of anonymity to find out whether CBI officers illegally tapped the phones of senior government officers. But this begs more questions: Can the CBI intercept our phones without the permission of the competent authority? If yes, then under what circumstances can they do so? How common is this kind of phone-tapping? A former CBI director had this to say: Did CBI illegally tap the phones of senior government officers in case of bribery against Rakesh Asthana? “The CBI Special Unit can put anybody’s mobile phone under surveillance to investigate a case, provided the CBI Director has granted permission to the Investigating Officer (IO). Simultaneously, within three days, the Director has to inform the Ministry of Home Affairs about the tapping and confirm permission within seven days. In the bribery case against Asthana, it appears that mobile phones of those who are named in the FIR were under surveillance. It was not illegal on the part of the CBI Director to give phone-tapping directions to the IO, if he had at the same time moved the files seeking permission from the competent authority.”  According to Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Centre and the State Governments have a right to tap phones. The investigating agencies can intercept calls of individuals merely on suspicion in case of public emergency or in the interest of public safety. The procedures and guidelines for lawful interception were laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of . The court ruled that telephone tapping is a serious invasion of an individual's privacy. However, the agency can carry out lawful interception after securing permission from the competent authority. According to a former CBI director: Can investigating agencies intercept anyone’s phone?  “The law agencies can put anybody’s phone under surveillance merely on the basis of suspicion, sometimes it is done only to extract information and sometimes intercepted calls are used as evidence. If the agency wants to use calls as evidence in the court then it is mandatory to take permission from the Home Secretary, without which it shall not be considered as admissible evidence.” Does the CBI illegally tap phones? “The CBI does intercept calls illegally just to extract information especially in trap cases, to know exactly when the bribe money will exchange hands. Sometimes illegal interception goes on for months. But illegal interceptions cannot be used as evidence.”  asked a former Home Ministry official: Under what circumstances can law agencies use tapped conversations as evidence? “Only those telephonic conversations can be used as evidence in court which have the permission of the Home Secretary. Without it, the court will not take it as an admissible evidence.” According to a former CBI director: Can the investigative agency  initiate phone tapping, only after the FIR is registered? “The agencies can start tapping phones even before registering the FIR. Within three days, from the day the phone has been tapped, the CBI Director has to seek  permission from the Home Secretary and get confirmation within seven days. The file seeking permission is confidential and is carried by hand, by a Joint Director-level officer to the Home Ministry. The JD has to show the file personally to the Home Secretary and explain the matter to him. Generally, the process is completed within a day.” What if the authority denies permission? “If the authority denies permission, then the agency cannot use the recordings as evidence and also has to destroy them at the earliest.” Does the authority’s job end with the issuance of permission? “No. The permission is valid for only two months from the date of issuance. However, the total period of interception cannot exceed six months. The agency has to  seek permission again from the authority to continue intercepting the phones. On the other hand, the authority has to maintain records of intercepted communication, a list of those people who are privy to the intercepted recordings or are in possession of the same, and the extent to which the material is copied.” One petition after another in the Supreme Court on the CBI row has snowballed into a major crisis. Now it is up to the SC to decide whether it orders probe on the telephonic recordings of the senior officials as claimed by CBI officers Sinha and Bassi. The SC is also likely to look into whether CBI Director Alok Verma followed procedure and wrote to the Home Secretary seeking permission to intercept calls of those who were involved in the bribery case against Asthana. Now, if Verma did follow procedure, then what is the current status of the file? (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Speaking on the panel of BloombergQuint’s primetime show about the timing of the dissolution, BJP leader Brigadier Anil Gupta said: When asked if the PDP’s alliance with the NC and Congress was the “prod” needed by the governor to dissolve the Assembly, Gupta said, “these parties have been asking for the dissolution of Assembly.

The Quint,"Amid the ongoing political turmoil in Jammu and Kashmir, Sajjad Lone, leader of the People's Conference, on Wednesday, 21 November, staked claim to form government in the state with the support of the 25-legislator strong Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ""more than 18"" other lawmakers. Once a separatist leader, Sajjad Gani Lone joined mainstream politics after his father and prominent J&K leader Abdul Gani was assassinated in Srinagar in 2002. Even after taking over the reins of the People’s Conference, Lone continued to be part of separatist politics but differences with hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani ultimately forced him to part ways with the separatist group. In 2004, he parted ways with his brother Bilal Gani Lone to float his own faction of the party. He went onto contest the 2009 general elections as an independent candidate from the Baramulla constituency, but was defeated. Lone was elected to the State Assembly from the Handwara constituency after the 2014 elections. A few months prior to the election, he had made the headlines for meeting with Narendra Modi in Delhi in connection with the then ongoing J&K elections. Born on 9 December 1966, Sajjad Lone did his schooling from Burn Hall School in Srinagar and later completed his graduation from the University of Wales College of Cardiff, UK. He married a Pakistani national of Kashmiri origin, Asma Khan, in 2000 and the couple have two children – Emad Lone and Adnan Lone. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Alok Prasanna Kumar,"Just as surely as the settling smog is a sign of winter across North India, so also a state government’s announcement of reservations to a dominant group, a sign of impending elections in the state. This time, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has   the dominant Maratha community in the state, reservations as a “socially and educationally backward community” on the basis of a report said to have been submitted to it by the Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission. The basis on which the Commission has concluded that Marathas are “socially and educationally backward” is not entirely clear – the report has not yet been made public and is likely to be tabled in the Maharashtra State Assembly in the winter session. That said, there is   to suggest that Marathas as a people, are anything but. Whether on education, access to government jobs, poverty rates, or land ownership, Marathas are relatively better off than most other castes in Maharashtra. More crucially, there is no evidence to suggest that Marathas, if they suffer any deprivation, do so   of social backwardness. This is a key point that is often missed in the debate over reservations. Reservations are not charity meant to alleviate poverty – rather they are tools used to address systemic inequality and discrimination that had been a feature of Indian society for the better part of two millennia. Increasingly however, the demand for reservations is being made not to ensure parity, but to entrench inequality and power. Even assuming that Marathas are somehow considered “socially and educationally backward” for the purposes of reservation, Maharashtra’s proposal may run into further legal problems. As it stands, the Supreme Court has held that reservations in a state cannot cross the 50 percent limit (save for “exceptional circumstances” which are yet to be decided). There is already a “special backward category” entitled to 2 percent reservation, but quite clearly the state is not looking to fit Marathas into this group. Rather, what is being promised is a new category, namely, “Socially and Economically Backward Class”. This is not really a new categorisation, as the Constitution requires that reservations be granted  to socially and educationally backward classes under clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution. But that still doesn’t answer the question as to   the state of Maharashtra plans to reserve jobs and educational seats for Marathas. There are broadly three options – include them within the category of “other backward classes”, create a sub-category of “socially and educationally backward class” within OBCs, or create an entirely new category of “socially and educationally backward class” outside the existing reservation matrix. Since Marathas constitute 16 percent of the state’s population, any attempt at creating an exclusive category for them within the OBC category is likely to invite a strong backlash from the remaining OBCs in the state. The third option, of adding to the existing reservation with a new category only for Marathas, is likely to fall afoul of the Supreme Court mandated limit of 50 percent on reservations. Tamil Nadu is the only state which has managed to provide reservation well above the 50 percent limit. However, the legality of this move is still pending decision in the Supreme Court. On the other hand, the Supreme Court and High Courts have repeatedly   any move to grant reservations beyond the 50 percent limit. Given the facts on the ground and the legal hurdles, it is difficult to see this move by the Maharashtra government, withstanding any legal scrutiny. The Bombay High Court has   reservations for Marathas in the past. The state government may have gone through the motions of following procedure in getting the State Backward Classes Commission to submit a “report” on the status of Marathas but it is unlikely to convince many that Marathas suffer deprivation  of their social status. Politicians are well aware of the legal limits (flawed as they are) on the power to grant reservations, yet continue to promise and grant reservations to groups, in as unconstitutional and illegal a manner as possible. On the other hand, they have now been appropriated by dominant groups who want to retain their position and status in the ‘graded inequality’ that is the caste system.

PTI,"Saudi Arabia has warned that criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a ""red line"", after Donald Trump heaped praise on the kingdom in defiance of warnings he was giving Riyadh a pass on a journalist's grisly murder. His comments came as the US president praised Saudi Arabia for keeping oil prices low – one strand of his argument against punishing Riyadh even though the CIA reportedly found strong evidence that the crown prince, the de facto Saudi leader, was involved in the murder.

But Trump, on holiday at his Florida Mar-a-Lago Club on Wednesday, doubled down on a statement from Tuesday. “Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy!

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"The senior-most woman leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union Minister for External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj has announced that she would not contest the next Lok Sabha election. This move of hers raises more questions than providing answers regarding her current stand in the party and government. For starters, if her health is indeed a concern, what is she doing in the government? Would it not be better to stay at home and tend to her well-being? Or, does this show that being a minister in the Narendra Modi government is not taxing on one's health? After all, yet another vacancy after Ananth Kumar's death is something that can be done without. But, if her announcement is indeed a prelude to retiring from public life, the decision impinges on future continuance of several of her colleagues who remain in office despite indifferent or even critical health. Without a doubt, if Swaraj's statement on Tuesday, 20 November, is indeed a personal voluntary retirement declaration, it would add to the call that the prime minister must, henceforth, seek medical certification before appointing colleagues as ministers or retaining them. There can be only two other reasons besides her health (not so precarious that she cannot continue as minister, yet severe enough to prevent her from tending to the parliamentary constituency, which a good MP must). First, she has picked up the message from the power duo that she has been selected for promotion to Marg Darshak Mandal and be politely informed on the eve of 2019 polls that the party has ""other plans"" for her. Second, she has read the signs of an impending doom and no longer believes in the hype around the modern-day political Titanic: God himself could not sink the ship. All the possibilities we are faced with and examined so far suggest that Swaraj is a smart politician. To have survived cumulatively for five years in two innings, spread over more than a decade between 1977 and 1990 in Haryana's Aaya Ram-Gaya Ram politics, is indeed a pointer of consummate skills in political survival. And these two tenures as minister were with one of the most astute Lals of Haryana politics as chief minister -- the patriarch, Devi Lal. Women in the sangh parivar have been just a handful, and most have owed their position either to being the wife, mother or sister of someone powerful, or having a commanding leader as patron. Sushma Swaraj, on the other hand, was a trailblazer for being the first woman mass leader who made a career by sheer dint and tactically aligning with senior leaders. Not a person with a background in the sangh parivar, she passed the litmus test at her first outing in the union ministry in 1996. She proved her  bonafides by banning, as Information and Broadcasting minster in her short 13-day tenure, an advertisement of a television brand which showed a woman in a billowing skirt. She followed this with other decisions, including the directive against Fashion TV. Ultimately, her  push proved to be a limiting factor and she too was reduced to being a mother or sister. In an article   on Swaraj's decision, Vani Tripathi -- a member of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and a former national secretary of the BJP -- wrote, ""Sushma Didi is a mother figure and an elder sister to me in many ways."" The concept that a woman politician can inspire another only as a maternal figure and nothing else demonstrates that the firm grasp of patriarchy does not even spare women in politics, particularly in sangh parivar, which still does not admit women into the ideological fountainhead - the RSS. But, Shashi Tharoor has, on this occasion, not been a paradox that he once was and the politician in him has also read what an astute analyst and commentator has. He tweeted a couple of hours after Swaraj's announcement, ""For all our political differences, I am sorry that @SushmaSwaraj will leave Parliament..."" But then, history is replete with instances of leaders not even being put up by their party in an election and later bouncing back – PV Narasimha Rao in 1991 being the most eminent instance. He had packed to return to his home state when Rajiv Gandhi's assassination ensured he became prime minister. For a new innings for Swaraj, one will have to bank on glorious uncertainties. In a regime where certainty and decisiveness have been its proclaimed hallmarks, possibility of such a development is not happy augury for its presiding duo.

The Quint,"Defending his immediate call to dissolve the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Wednesday, 21 November, Governor Satya Pal Malik said he took the call in order to save the Valley from an “unworkable alliance” and “a mess”. The following are reasons listed by the governor for dissolving the assembly.  Talking to the media, Governor Malik said that just because the alliance presented numbers does not mean that they will be allowed to form a government in Jammu and Kashmir. “For giving a chance, number is not important. They are so diametrically opposed that they cannot run a government for even four days. I cannot thwart the state into a mess ( ” he told News18, and added that the alliance’s number cannot be ascertained unless proven in Assembly. The state plunged into a political crisis on Wednesday, 21 November, when Governor Satya Pal Malik dissolved the Assembly after PDP President Mehbooba Mufti and People's Conference leader Sajjad Lone staked their respective claims to form the government in the state. The governor further stated that he did not want the state to suffer from a “directionless alliance”. “I cannot hand over the government to an unworkable alliance, I don’t know what will they do if I hand over the government to them, they might go ahead and dissolve panchayat elections, which are currently underway,” the governor said while clarifying his move. The governor said the mandate PDP President Mehbooba Mufti is talking about was never given to her by the state. “Let them fight elections now. I will be honoured if they are chosen by the people.” “When was this proposed alliance a mandate? Had this been a mandate, they would have made the government earlier and she would not have formed the government with the BJP,” Malik told News18. He said that the proposed alliance by Mufti was not the mandate but an opportunistic alliance of people who had nothing in common. The governor said that under no circumstances, he would have allowed “horse trading” and “under defection” of MLAs. “I have been saying it since day one of my appointment as Governor that I'm not in favour of any government formed in the state with underhand defection and horse trading,” Governor Malik said, adding that he would instead prefer elections are held and selected government rule the state. Making a revelation, the governor added that he has been receiving complaints of horse trading and MLAs being threatened. “I've been receiving complaints for past 15 days of horse trading and that MLAs are being threatened. Mehbooba Ji herself complained that her MLAs are being threatened. The other party said there is planning of distribution of money. I couldn't have allowed this to happen,” the governor added. The decision to allow the alliance of NC, PDP and the Congress would have demoralised the armed forces, Governor Malik reasoned. “Police and army have put their life in way against terrorism in the Valley. They are protecting every life, think about them. They are demoralised and the move to allow the alliance to stake claim would have made for a directionless government with four people going in one direction and six people going in another,” Malik told News18. Faced with accusations of ignoring Mehbooba Mufti’s attempt at staking claim to form a government in the Valley - including a tweet - Governor Malik said, “Are governments formed through social media? I neither tweet nor see the tweets. I selected yesterday’s day for the decision of dissolution of assembly as it was a holy day, it was Eid.” “Election Commission will decide when polls will be held,” he announced. On being asked what happens when the parties who wanted to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir take a legal route, Malik said they (the parties) can go to court and tell the judge that they wanted the Assembly to be dissolved for five months, which has finally happened. “They can go. They can say that ‘we wanted the Assembly to be dissolved and now we have got it’,” Malik told News18. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Ifra Jan,"Never has the luxury of staying aloof from Indian mainstream politics been as non-existent for the Kashmiris as it is now. Till 2014, it was either the Indian National Congress (INC), People's Democratic Party (PDP), or National Conference (NC) which would get to form the government in the volatile state of Jammu and Kashmir, with differing power-sharing equations. With the grand entry of BJP into the Indian parliament and a robotically efficient election army, it started making forays into hitherto non-BJP bastions, one of the places being the Kashmir Valley. After the PDP-BJP alliance broke up, it was believed that the PDP was on the verge of a split being engineered from New Delhi, where a fraction of PDP wanted to form a coalition with the government. However, the inroads that were made into the recent Urban Local Body Elections, by the BJP-backed Junaid Azim Mattoo, and Sajjad Gani Lone forming the new 'anti dynasty front' – the Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference – surely gave the NC and PDP sleepless nights. Their decision to not participate in the local body elections meant that many proxy candidates with the support of the BJP were able to get elected to the local level posts. It set the alarm bells ringing for both PDP and the National Conference, and within a day, rumours of a possible alliance between the two started making it to social media networks, soon to be confirmed officially by the legislators of respective parties. In a dramatic turn of events, Mehbooba Mufti, tweeting from her official verified account, that her letter to form a stake for the Legislative assembly with PDP being the largest party with 29 MLAs, with the support of 15 MLAs of NC, and 12 MLAs of Congress, should be allowed to prove her majority through a floor test. The 'fax' was apparently not received by the Raj Bhavan. Within an hour, Sajjad Gani Lone, with the support of BJP and 'rebel' MLAs who were not named, also staked a claim. Ethically, the governor, should have called for a floor test and challenged both of them to prove their majority. Instead, within five minutes, the governor announced the dissolution of the assembly. When the BJP-PDP alliance was formed, many hoped that the 'marriage between East and the West' would ferment and calm down the hardliners on all sides, as now the power was seen to be shared equally between the Hindu-dominated Jammu, and Muslim- dominated Valley. It was seen to bring the Valley closer to Jammuites after the Amarnath agitation drove a wedge between the two main provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. So, what are the political permutations and combinations that could work in Kashmir? None that can be pre-postulated. Consider this. Kashmir has mostly witnessed periods of calm during the governor's rule, a constitutional post which is the direct representative of the Centre. Snowfall, onset of winter, police intelligence, sporadic events (like the death of popular militant leader, or civilian causalities in an encounter) get to determine the level of calm in the Valley. A 'mahagathbandhan' as it is was being called, would have been seen standing up to the ruling party at the Centre –as it was clearly an anti-BJP alliance, and therefore would have had the potential to restore some degree of credibility to democratic process and institutions in the Valley. In fact the huge turnout in the last state elections –a rare occurrence – and a non-existent fury on the part of the separatists, was a result of an understanding of not letting the BJP make inroads into Kashmir. Jammu constantly complains of not having an equal voice in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir, and of neglect by the Centre. If all the elected representatives of the province got to sit in the opposition, it could have flared up the sentiments of the people. The alliance should also force the political parties in Kashmir to now tone down their 'Self Rule' documents and reorganise their manifestos to suit a present Kashmir in contemporary India. Thanks to the digital revolution, with every Kashmiri now boasting a smart phone, gone are the days when you could should shout 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' in Delhi and next day in Kashmir, votes would be collected in the name of Pakistan. It was this unethical politics which was responsible for the considerable erosion of legitimacy of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It was after all the widespread rigging in 1988 state elections that first pushed the Valley into the grip of widespread militancy, with almost all members of the Muslim United Front crossing over to other side of Line of Control. However, the decision of the governor could face the Supreme Court, with the Karnataka precedent strongly on the side of Mehbooba Mufti. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Addressing a gathering in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday, 21 November, former prime minister Manmohan Singh tore into the current government’s promises made to youth and farmers. The former prime minister also slammed Modi-led government’s demonetisation move and called it a “monumental failure”. “Demonetisation was a monumental failure; it was a deliberate and designed attack on SMEs, farmers and housewives,” the former prime minister said and added that the move was a dubious one to convert black money to white. Days before Madhya Pradesh votes for their next state government, Dr Manmohan Singh reminded that state of its agrarian crisis. “The farmers are in great pain all over India, including Madhya Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh has a very high incidence of farmer suicide; a farmer commits suicide every five hours in the state. Between 2004 and 2016, MP saw nearly 17,000 farmer suicides,” he said. Reminding people of PM Modi-led government’s election campaign slogan “Achhe Din”, Dr Manmohan Singh said that the promise has been reduced to a pipe dream. “Creation of 2 crore jobs per annum for the youth promised by Modi ji in 2014 is a pipe dream mooted by the Modi Government. The only reliable data is the quarterly survey of the Labour Bureau,” the former prime minister said. The former prime minister said that the people of the country are suspicious of Rafale deal. “The Opposition and various groups are demanding a joint parliamentary committee but Modi government isn’t ready for it,"" Singh said in his address to media in Indore on Wednesday.

The three are likely to stake claim to form a new government – with senior PDP leader, Syed Altaf Bukhari, likely to be the consensus chief ministerial candidate. Here’s everything you need to know about the state’s next probable Chief Minister. A leading businessman and horticulturist, Bukhari is the owner of FIL Industries, Asia’s third largest fruit juice concentrate manufacturing unit. In the past, he has been on the Board of Directors of the National Horticulture Board, and on the Board of Governors of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. The senior leader has also served on the board of Management of the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences and Technology, in Jammu and Kashmir. In the 2014 Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Bukhari contested and won from the Amira Kadal constituency in Srinagar. The PDP leader defeated the BJP’s candidate, Hina Bhatt, in the process. In March 2014, Bukhari was appointed as the state’s Finance Minister after Haseeb Drabu, was sacked by the then state Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti for his remarks that Kashmir is “not a political issue”. Altaf Bukhari is the frontrunner for the post of chief minister if the three big parties in the state form the government in the state that has been under the Governor’s rule for the last five months. According to local daily  , Bukhari confirmed that the three parties were in talks to form a government, after a meeting with former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.

Abheek Barman,"This weekend, toxic trolls morphed into savarna saviours. Ironically, the focus of their wrath was Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, a portal that turns sociopaths into stars and broadcasts the existential angst of US president Donald Trump in 280 characters, real time. Poor Jack was mauled after a photograph of him holding a poster that read, “Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy”, on a visit to India went viral. Brahmanical patriarchs (BPs) worldwide weren’t amused, and expressed themselves in language that would’ve shamed any  . This included a serving central police officer who mused why Dorsey shouldn’t be jailed for ‘provoking’ caste riots. Thankfully, such conflagrations have not occurred. But Twitter has grovelled for its CEO’s ‘misstep,’ much as a Dalit would have to if her shadow darkened the water of a high-caste well. The venom dumped on Dorsey proves many things. Nearly 250 years after Raja Ram Mohan Roy began his campaign against child marriage and the practice of  , upper-caste misogyny remains a toxic undertow in Indian society. Roy was horrified by the practice of child marriage and condemned it strongly. The   had prescribed, “A man of 30 years shall marry a maiden of 12 who pleases him, or a man of 24, a girl of eight years of age.” Upper-caste society improved on this by condemning boys as young as seven or eight to marrying girls who were five years of age, or younger. His carriage was attacked by mobs on the streets of Calcutta. For some time, he had to be protected by police from hooligans rented by powerful conservatives. In 1829, four years before Roy’s death, Governor General William Bentinck abolished  . In 1883, Kadambini Ganguly (nee Bose) and Chandramukhi Basu became India’s and the British Empire’s first women university graduates. That year Kadambini married Dwarakanath Ganguly, Brahmo pioneer and reformist. With Dwarakanath’s support Kadambini graduated as a doctor from the Bengal Medical College. Dwarakanath fought each slander in court and with a recommendation from Florence Nightingale, Kadambini sailed for Britain to specialise. She returned in the 1890s, with multiple degrees from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin, south Asia’s first western-trained woman doctor. She was no political wallflower: in 1889 she was one of six women at Congress’ fifth session; in 1906, she organised a womens’ conference to protest the previous year’s partition of Bengal and was president of a meeting to express solidarity with Gandhi’s satyagraha in Transvaal, South Africa. Around the same time, Ramabai Dongre, who was given the title of Pandita Saraswati by Calcutta University for her mastery of Sanskrit texts, turned her unforgiving gaze on Hindu society. Born to a Brahmin home in 1853, she converted to Christianity in Britain in the 1880s. She travelled in the US, talking and writing her best-known book, ‘The High-Caste Hindu Woman’ in 1888. She points out that Vashishta writes, “There is no place for a man (in Heaven) who is destitute of male offspring…. If unfortunately a wife happens to have all daughters and no son, Manu authorises the husband of such a woman to supersede her with another in the 11th year of their marriage.” She concludes, “In no other country is the mother so laden with care and anxiety on the approach of childbirth as in India.” We believed caste abuses would die with affirmative action, universal adult voting and a narrowing of the upper-lower caste wealth gap. But in a 2015 paper in  , Smriti Sharma of the Delhi School of Economics finds the opposite is true. Violence decreased in intensity when SC-ST incomes stagnated and upper caste spending soared, widening the gap. Ramabai wrote, “A humorous author has said, with some truth, that ‘the Hindus even sin religiously.’” It’s not funny, 210 years on.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Namit Saxena,"The unusual   case unfolding before the Supreme Court has attracted a lot of attention. Tuesday’s (20 November) hearing (or not?) attracted maximum attention as Chief Justice of India Gogoi expressed extreme displeasure on the leakage (or not?) of Alok Verma’s response to the CVC, being carried in the form of an article by  . Justice Gogoi was also upset about the request from Alok Verma’s Counsel the day before, seeking more time to file the response. Unusual as it may seem, Senior Advocate Fali S Nariman appearing for Alok Verma, responded by shifting the blame to the press, terming the article ‘irresponsible’, and on the Counsel, who requested for more time, calling it ‘unauthorised’. Graciously, Justice Gogoi permitted this. When the matter was taken up again, Nariman sought to clarify the article, but Justice Gogoi had made up his mind by then. He refused to hear him and the other counsel who were trying to clear out their names, and made it clear that the Supreme Court is the place for adjudication of legal rights alone. Three things are important here. One, whether the response by Alok Verma to the CVC report filed in the court was to be in a sealed cover. Second, whether the sharing of a response to the CVC questionnaire by an online media portal irk the top court of the country to the extent that it would postpone the hearing of a matter as sensitive as this, by  . And I ask myself this question, should a judge get irked at all when he wants to decide only on legal issues? Third, are we enhancing the ‘sealed cover jurisprudence’ and is it valid? Due to reasons best known to it, the CVC report was filed before the Court in a sealed cover, such that the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta also did not receive a copy, had to seek the same from the Court. But on 16 November 2018, the Supreme Court adopted the sealed cover mode, and directed that the CVC report be furnished to the Counsel appearing for Alok Verma in a sealed cover, and that he can file his response to the same before the Court in  . The story by   dated   that is, prior to the hearing on the same date, claims to have seen Verma’s official response to the CVC Questionnaire. It is therefore crystal clear that the intent of the Supreme Court was that the response by Verma to the CVC Report should be for the eyes of the bench only. Interestingly, the Counsel appearing for Verma requested on 19 November, seeking more time in filing the response to the CVC Report. I wonder how, if the response to the CVC Report wasn’t even prepared to be filed, could The Wire have seen it. It will be interesting to see if Justice Gogoi takes it forward or proceeds with the case on its merit. Second, a good judge must not only be independent, courageous, and knowledgeable, they must also possess integrity and a calm, rational mind. Justice Gogoi ought to have kept his calm, and should decide on legal issues alone. The sharing of the response was not crucial to the legal issues involved in the matter. I must also point out the trend of the ‘jurisprudence of sealed cover’. Justice must be transparent, not opaque. Of late, on a number of occasions including the Judge Loya case, the Bhima Koregaon row, the NRC issue and the Rafale deal, all these saw sealed covers directly for the bench. Transfer of information from bar to bench, which is directly accessible by the bench alone, violates the constitutional dictum of open justice and reasonable justification. Justice Gogoi recently said at the 3rd Ramnath Goenka Memorial Lecture that ‘independent judges and noisy journalists are democracy’s first line of defence’. Rephrasing the same, makes less sense. Independent journalists and noisy judges does not make for a healthy combination. I hope the judiciary, as the 3rd pillar and the media as the 4th one, fight the evils independently and noisily, together. Till then, fingers crossed. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

He also said that he would be resigning from the Lok Sabha. In a three-page letter to TRS chief and incumbent Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Vishweshwar wrote, ""A separate Telangana was the aspiration of the people and a noble cause, as the people felt that the injustice meted out to them in the combined state of Andhra Pradesh would end...You had asked me to join the TRS party in 2013. Acknowledging your leadership role in the history of the struggle, I did join the party. KT Rama Rao visited me many times and showed me the vision of a people-centric, ideology-based party...and hence, I joined with hope and enthusiasm."" Vishweshwar then outlined how he had worked hard for his constituency, touring several places, representing the people who voted him to power in the Parliament as well. ""I was forced into a position of contemplating leaving the party despite the fact that today, TRS enjoys significant goodwill in the social circles that we are in. I thought long and hard about this step before deciding to take this major decision and analysed the scenario by listing my disappointments at various levels,"" he added. Vishweshwar also said that he had fought for the party when it needed him but he was now 'powerless' and could not 'speak out' and had also decided to resign from the Lok Sabha. ""However, the party has inducted people who were against Telangana and our ideology into the cabinet and given them more power and prominence. I feel people who were fighting for Telangana and share a common ideology, including me, are no longer needed in the party,"" Vishweshwar wrote.

Mudasir Ahmad,"18-year-old Nadeem Manzoor, a student, was kidnapped by suspected militants on the eve of 15 November, in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. Two days later, Huzaif Ashraf, a young baker, was abducted from his shop early morning as well. In between these two disappearances, Kashmir saw a total of eight abductions taking place within72 hours. While six of them were let off, Huzaif and Nadeem didn’t make it. The bullet-riddled body of Nadeem from Shopian was found in an orchard in a Pulwama village while the throat-silt body of Huzaif was spotted some 15 kms away from his home. Tragically, the families of some of the deceased, have fallen prey to the belief that their sons deserved to die, if they indeed were informers. Bhat’s elder brother Abdul Hamid interrupted him. “This punishment is less for him if he has really done what people are talking about in the video (on social media),” he said. The Bhat clan, consisting of seven brothers (all married) live in same locality. Since Nadeem’s killing, members of the extended family haven’t left their homes. More than the death of Nadeem, Manzoor and his brothers talked about the “disrespect our son has brought to the entire family”. “Imagine if somebody asks for the reason my son was killed, what will we say. My back is broken,” said a distraught Manzoor. In the Kashmir Valley, where deaths of civilians trigger massive protests, the lack of mass anger and protest is conspicuous, an indication that militants were behind the acts. In a video released by militants on social media, Nadeem, who had completed his class 11 examinations last month, admits about informing the Army about the presence of militants in his neighborhood on 6 November. Two militants were subsequently killed in an early morning encounter the following day. “That evening as the encounter raged on, he (Nadeem) rushed to my room and complained of having developed sudden pain in his heart… he was frightened. That was for the first time he wanted to sleep in my room,” said Nadeem’s elder brother, Sartaj Ahmad, as his father and uncles listened to him keenly. Over the past four days, the Bhat family has seen a trickle of mourners visiting them, mostly relatives and neighbors from the locality. However, his funeral had seen few in attendance. “This was written in our fate,” sighed Nadeem’s uncle, Fayaz Ahmad, a government teacher. More than 30 kms away from Safanagri, in the remote Manzgam village of Kulgam, the Kutay family fails to understand what led to the killing of their son, Huzaif. “They came to my shop and asked me to work as their informer. They took my mobile number and called me in the evening, promising they will pay me Rs 10,000…they forced me to work for them as an informer. Our family is very poor. I won’t repeat this mistake,” Huzaif admits to acting as an informer for the forces, in another video released by militants. On 17 November, masked men arrived in a car at his shop at around 10 am. “They bundled him in the car and before fleeing the spot they also took along my son and another local youth,” recalled Mohammad Amin Ganai. His son Shahid Ahmad Ganai and Farooq Ahmad were released, but Huzaif reached home – dead – his throat slit. According to Shahid, after driving them around for some time, the “masked men” covered the faces of their victims and took them away in separate vehicles. “I was released in the evening. That is all I know,” a frightened Shahid said, refusing to talk further. “Please leave me alone,” he said at Huzaif’s home, before rushing to his cousin’s grave, barely 100-meters from the Kutay house. “At home he never indulged in any wrongdoing. I don’t know what the allegations were,” he said. Then, after a brief pause, the elderly man continued: “The last time he came home was on Eid (20 August). He was a baker, and that is all I know. We were all yearning to see him, not knowing that he would be brought home dead.” “I couldn’t even gather courage to see his face for the last time,” said Ashraf, his eyes welling up. This isn’t for the first time that Kashmir has witnessed the killings of civilians, accused by militants of working for security forces. This summer, Hajin town in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district saw a series of such assassinations; one of those killed was beheaded. However, the fact that the killings of Huzaif and Nadeem were recorded and the video clips released on social media, is something that has happened for the first time. A senior police official from south Kashmir said the Hizbul Mujahideen was behind the killings. “We have credible inputs that two groups of the outfit carried out the killings separately,” he said. “Probably for the first time in the history of terrorism in J&K, a slaughter committed by terrorists has been filmed and circulated. There have been many in the past but those weren’t filmed…,” senior superintendent of police Imtiyaz Hussain, wrote on Twitter. (       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The party conducts a survey to see which candidate is likely to win from which constituency. My name came up in that survey. So the party discussed it with Kailash Vijayvargiya and said that since the party does not encourage dynasty politics, it would give the ticket to either one of us. My father suggested I should be given the ticket since my name came up in the survey and that he would work toward bringing the BJP to power in Kolkata.

Basudev Mahapatra,"With the assembly elections due in Odisha in early 2019 alongside the parliamentary elections, the bugle has been sounded. Although there is still time for the Central Election Commission to make necessary notifications for the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in Odisha, political parties in the state have begun their election-related exercises already. A few media and survey agencies have also started fuelling the political mood of an election through different speculations. The ruling party Biju Janata Dal (BJD), seems to be confident about winning a fifth consecutive term in the assembly polls because of the personality of its party president and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. This, and the populist schemes implemented by the state government for the benefit of almost all segments of society. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expects that its success in the 2017 panchayat polls will go further in the 2019 elections under the influence of the ‘Modi magic’. Though the strong Modi wave of 2014 couldn’t fetch any significant benefit for the party’s state chapter, his persona may work well this time “because of his work for social and economic development of the country,” said a senior BJP leader seeking anonymity. Although the party has been following a declining trend in Odisha since 2000, leaders of the party believe that a revival through the current makeover exercise added with an aggressive campaign, can place the party as a strong political force by the time the 2019 elections approach. Surprisingly, neither BJD nor BJP considers INC as a political threat or an important competitor despite the fact that the INC was the second largest as well as the Opposition party in the assembly with 16 seats out of 147, while BJP was the third with only 10 seats. However, the INC saw a decline from the 2009 tally where its vote share was 29.10 percent. But BJD and BJP on the other hand saw a growth from 38.86 percent and 15.05 percent respectively. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which were conducted simultaneously with the assembly polls, the BJD had a share of 44.77 percent valid votes against INC’s 26.38 percent and BJP’s 21.88 percent. In less than three years, in the , BJP emerged as the main contender (against BJD) by winning in 297   (ZP) zones out of a total of 853. In 2012, the party had been able to win in only 36 zones. This gave a huge boost to the BJP, and prompted the party’s national president Amit Shah to set his ambitious dream of winning a minimum of 120 out of 147 seats in the Odisha Assembly in the forthcoming 2019 elections. Encouraged by the result, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told the  , “You will see the change in the next two years. We are ready with our plans and we shall execute them.” From a whopping 654 in 2012, it plummeted to 473 in 2017. The INC’s performance was poor in the panchayat polls. It could bag only 60 zones as opposed to the 128 it won in 2012. Barely a year after this, the victory of BJD’s Rita Sahu by a margin over 40,000 votes against the BJP candidate in the Bijepur by-election, came as a boost for the BJD. The result was however quite bitter for the BJP and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who led the campaign after being perceived as the chief ministerial face of the party. During the panchayat polls of 2017, political experts believe that a part of the traditional Congress votes went to the BJP to bring it its unexpected success. But in the Bijepur by-election, the trend didn’t remain so because the Congress votes went to the BJD, as its candidate, Rita Sahu, happened to be the wife of Congress MLA Subal Sahu, whose death led to the by-election. The sympathy factor and the INC’s inability to field a proper candidate, went in favour of the BJD. Now, in order to fulfill its dreams of performing big, the BJP needs to bring a part of the Congress votes to its fold, while expecting the benefits of the anti-incumbency factor. The BJD too may try to realise its dream of coming to power for a fifth term, bringing more Congress votes to its side, to counter the anti-incumbency factor. As BJD has already tried it to win the Bijepur by-election, the BJP seems to be replicating the same in many assembly constituencies. Keeping this in mind, and in order to reverse the declining trend, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) in the state has already started its makeover exercises. It has brought many fresh youthful faces from different walks of life to its fold who are becoming more acceptable to the public. “The leadership also wants to include youth faces while selecting candidates for the coming elections,” said Satya Prakash Nayak, a popular face from the media sector who now chairs the media committee of the party in the state. With youth and intellectuals showing interest in the party, the scenario seems to be changing for the INC in Odisha. “We have taken up the farmers’ issues and different social issues concerning people living in rural Odisha,” Nayak added. In such a situation, the first casualty will be the BJP, which will not only fail to attract Congress votes, but also its vote share may decrease with migrated Congress votes returning to the original party fold. The BJD vote share may also fall, with the Congress votes returning to its original fold. Anti-incumbency being a strong factor in Indian elections, the INC may emerge as a strong power and give the BJD a tough fight in the 2019 elections, if things go as expected.

Kritika Goel Neeraj Gupta," (We don’t want the difference in the price for our produce, we just want the right price),” a group of farmers told   in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur. Ahead of the Assembly polls in the state, farm crisis and agrarian distress remains a big poll issue, and this discontent among farmers in Mandsaur could dampen the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) performance. The farmers in Mandsaur’s   are angry with the government, and they say they don’t want compensation, insurance or loan waivers but the ‘right price’for their produce. Panna Lal, a farmer, who had come to Mandsaur   from Deori village, told : Lal was referring to the Mandsaur farmer agitation in which at least six farmers were killed in police firing. Another farmer, Paras Choudhary, who had come to the with his garlic produce prompted, “  (First the British enslaved us, and now Shivraj Singh Chouhan has made farmers slaves).” Echoing the vehement opposition against the government within the farmers in Mandsaur, Anil Soni, another farmer from Nagri, said,“A common man doesn’t want to die like he died during the 2017 farmer agitation, but what do we do?” “  (On one hand, the government says we feed everyone in the country, and on the other hand, they insult us like this),” Soni added. “I think I will vote for the Congress because I think a change is needed,” Soni told  . Soni also spoke about the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana that was launched by the Madhya Pradesh state government after the 2017 farmer agitation to provide relief to farmers in case of a price difference between the minimum support price and the model price. He said, “We don’t want any such scheme, we only want the price of our produce.” The farmers   spoke to said none of the schemes of the government have helped them in any way. “Earlier, we used to sell soyabean for Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 a quintal but now we get half of what we should be getting. Why does this happen?” Lal told  . A group of farmers in the   said they are selling garlic for Rs 500-Rs 1,800, which they used to sell for Rs 4,000-10,000. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, in 2015, a total of 12,602 persons involved in the farming sector killed themselves. Of these, 8,007 were farmers/cultivators and 4,595 were agricultural labourers. Of the 8,007 farmers, 581 came from Madhya Pradesh. The data also reveals that major causes of suicide were reported as ‘Bankruptcy or Indebtedness’. Lal also questions the central government’s claim of doubling the farm income by 2022 and says the government doesn’t do anything for the farmers unless it’s election season. He also says all the political parties are using the Mandsaur agitation as a political tool. “The government hasn’t done anything, nor has any other political party. They have only made the agitation a political issue for their benefit,” farmer Panna Lal told  . While there is anger and vocal opposition against the government, farmers say they will either vote for the Congress or NOTA, and if the Congress doesn’t perform well, they will show their strength in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The BJP and the Congress have made aggressive promises to the farmers in their manifestos. On one hand, the BJP has promised to ensure irrigation to every farmland and subsidy to farmers, while the Congress has promised to write off farm loans up to Rs 2 lakh. However, the brewing unrest among the farmers of Mandsaur give a sense that the farmers might give a big jolt to the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state election.

The Quint,"External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday, 20 September, announced she wouldn't fight the upcoming 2019 polls, citing health reasons. Swaraj, a senior BJP leader, was appointed the Minister of External Affairs after Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the 2014 general elections, making her only the second woman to hold the coveted post, after Indira Gandhi. Her tryst with the Lok Sabha elections began in 1996, when she first won a seat from the South Delhi constituency, and was subsequently re-elected from the constituency in 1998. Swaraj registered her first loss in the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 from the Bellary constituency in Karnataka, losing to the Congress’s Sonia Gandhi by a slim margin of 7%. Following this, Swaraj won the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Vidisha constituency in Madhya Pradesh, retaining the seat in the subsequent 2014 elections. Among the most tech-savvy politicians of her time, Swaraj has insightfully tapped into the potential of Twitter as an official communication tool, often conducting her business over the social media platform. She has reached out to several people in need via the platform, earning herself the title of  . Swaraj’s husband Swaraj Kaushal, erstwhile Governor of Mizoram and a Supreme Court lawyer, is almost as active as the EAM on Twitter, if not more. In fact, soon after her announcement, Kaushal responded on Twitter, replete with his dry humour: Kaushal has also often come to her rescue and also fought by her side against abusive trolls. A recent example of this is when Swaraj decided to issue passports to an inter-faith couple in Lucknow, after they faced harassment at the hands of the officials in the passport office. Swaraj was immediately targeted by several trolls on Twitter – with one particularly nasty troll stating that she be thrashed. Kaushal immediately jumped to her defence, tweeting: Interestingly, the couple have also engaged in some fun conversation on Twitter, often pulling each other’s leg. In 2016, the EAM tweeted: Similarly, in 2017, when Kaushal was asked by a Twitter user regarding his wife’s salary, he responded in his inimitable tongue-in-cheek manner by by saying, “Dekho – Meri umar aur Madam ki tankhah nahin poochho.

Avinash Kalla,"The nominations for assembly elections in Rajasthan that ended on Monday, 19 November, went down to the wire, as both parties kept going back and forth till the last hour. This resulted in hysteria and frenzy among ticket hopefuls. Party candidate one evening, and rebel by the following evening, was the order of the day. Monday ended with 2,212 candidates filing their nominations, but only 23 among them became the talk of town. They rebelled against their party and threw their hats into the contest as independents, thus, spicing up the election. Five ministers and eight MLAs have rebelled within the BJP, whereas four former ministers and six MLAs have rebelled from the Congress. Things started to heat up, as the Congress, while declaring its first list on 15 November, stuck to the guidelines of not giving tickets to those who have lost two consecutive MLA elections and denied a ticket to Brahmin leader and former state minister BD Kalla from Bikaner West, in turn giving Yogesh Gehlot a chance. It also nominated Khaniya Lal Jhawar from Bikaner East after he was included in the party merely hours before the announcement, at the behest of the Leader of Opposition, Rameshwar Dudi. The move irked Dudi, who publicly announced that if Jhawar is denied a ticket, he too will not contest from his seat Nokha, near Bikaner. In its second list on 17 November, the Congress announced that Manvendra Singh Jasol who had left the BJP, would contest against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje from Jhalrapatan. The announcement took many by surprise and voice of dissent started emerging in the constituency, as local congressmen cried ‘parachute’. Local Congress leader Shailendra Yadav has been upping the ante against Raje for the last three years, and has been at the receiving end. In the BJP, the first one to rebel was minister Surinder Goyal who has been a five time MLA, but was denied a ticket from Jaitaran in western Rajasthan. Soon he was joined by ministerial colleagues Hemsingh Badhana, Rajkumar Rinwa, Dhansingh Rawat and Omprakash Hudla. Another notable name for BJP is Bhawani singh Rajawat (considered close to CM Raje) being denied a ticket, and motormouth MLA Gyandev Ahuja who has been making headlines during mob lynching incidents in the state. To pacify these rebellions, backroom boys from both the parties have swung into action. Congress has deputed a four-member team comprising Vivek Bansal, Tarun Kumar, Kazi Nizamuddin and Devendra Yadav. They will rope in the top leaders from the state as and when required. She would be assisted by party chief MadanLal Saini, senior leader OM mathur and Union minister of State Gajendra Singh Shekawat. The Congress didn’t give an impression of a united house all through the nomination process, and would like to make up for it by acting swiftly to manage the situation in the next 48 hours, pacify the maximum number of people, and strategise accordingly. A look at the previous four assembly elections reveal that barring the exception of 2013, independents have managed to get around 10 percent votes and win seven to ten seats in the house and impact the fortune of around 15 seats.

Maj Navdeep Singh,"I am usually the last one to claim superiority of the military over other services. In fact, I have always maintained that officers serving the defence services and veterans should not be caustic about civil servants all the time, since it not only vitiates the working environment, but also reflects the shallow knowledge of the military community about other professions. Having said that, I found the tweets and letters by various civil service associations on the Bomdila incident a little odd. I say so because of several reasons. Ironically, the tweet, especially the one by the IPS Association, backfired, as can be seen from the responses to the same. But that is not the point that frightens. The point that disturbs the most is the fact that acerbic statements were made by civil service associations and also by veterans in return, which display a complete lack of respect for each others’ occupations. The point that disturbs also is the fact that many personalities justified the beating up of the troops in custody on the pretext that they were ‘caught’ misbehaving with ladies. Coming to the behaviour of the Commanding Officer. I do not find it wrong for him to have visited the police station to look into whether his troops had been illegally detained or not. His anger on finding them badly injured in lockup was natural. He is legally and morally bound to ensure the safety and welfare of his troops and whether any illegality has been committed on them. What followed, including the reports of manhandling of a young IAS officer, cannot be justified by anyone. In fact, it seems unlikely that a senior Army Officer would encourage such behaviour by his troops. However still, if in the chaos and the melee that ensued, the young Deputy Commissioner was manhandled, it is highly unfortunate since these young officers are representatives of the government in districts, and need to be fully protected and provided a shield against any such mishap. They need to be encouraged, not discouraged from their duties. The larger question of civil military relations also needs a re-look. While civil servants should be properly attuned to the needs and requirements of the military society and veterans, and there is an increasing feeling of alienation, there is also a need for the latter to refrain from passing sweeping comments against the civil services. It is wrongly perceived by veterans, that most members of the civil services are corrupt and inefficient, not realising that all of us come from the same society. Both the military and the civil services perhaps suffer from the same ills. The perception of military superiority, in any aspect, is highly misplaced. The job of young civil servants posted as DCs/DMs and SPs in charge of districts is not an easy one. There are so many pressures and multiple facets to the job such as magisterial functions, revenue, administration, health, crime, policing and what not on the shoulders of these young officers, which others are not aware of. To continually pinprick them with derogatory words on social media will not result in any respect to the military community, but will have just the opposite effect. The military needs to revolve around the real world, not the other way round. Mutual respect is the need of the times, and it is hoped that the incident in Bomdila would rather act as a catalyst for better times ahead with more optimum coordination and understanding of the roles of the defence services and civil servants.     .)

According to the data obtained by Nayak through RTI applications and poring through the scant records maintained by the Parliament, and those maintained regularly by the World Bank and RBI, it has been revealed that, between 2012 and mid-2018 more than 24,570 Indian workers died in six Gulf countries, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This works out to an average of more than  per day. The same data reveals that for every USD 1 billion they remitted to India during that period, there were at least   of Indian workers in these six Gulf countries. A comparative analysis of the data regarding remittances received from Indians working in Gulf countries with the datasets relating to death reveals the following preliminary results: On 4 April this year, the Minister of State for External Affairs Gen (Retd.) V K Singh, in reply to a question from Rajiv Pratap Rudy, said that there were 87.76 lakh Indians working in Gulf countries who have remitted USD 33.47 billion between April- September 2017. However, the Ministry of External Affairs does not maintain data on deaths of Indian workers  . While the Embassy of Kuwait replied that most of the details regarding deaths of Indian workers in that country was available online on its  (which contains month-wise deaths since 2014 only), UAE refused to provide even this data citing Section 8(1) (j) of the RTI Act, which exempts the disclosure of personal information which may cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual, or where the disclosure  . In order to fill up the gaps in the data (between 2012-13 which the Indian Embassy in Kuwait did not display) and the data which UAE refused to disclose, Nayak's analysis of data on the websites of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha indicated that the number of deaths (24,570), in the six Gulf countries between 2012 and mid-2018, could in fact   if the complete figures for Kuwait and UAE are made available publicly. Only the Indian Embassy in Qatar provided some information about the cause of deaths. In order to get comparative data on remittances, Nayak’s analysis of the World Bank’s   and the   suggested that “Indians working in Gulf countries accounted for more than half of the remittance that India received from all over the world during 2012-17.” According to Nayak, “when compared with the dataset regarding deaths of Indian workers obtained through RTI and parliamentary records, there were more than 187 deaths for every USD billion received from Oman during 2012-17; more than 183 deaths for every USD billion received from Bahrain and 162 deaths for every USD billion received from Saudi Arabia”. Conversely, Bahrain, which came at the bottom of the list in terms of total remittances during the same period (USD 7.19 billion only), stands at second place in terms of the number of deaths of Indian workers per USD billion remitted (a little more than 183 deaths). In other words, every USD billion earned by Indian workers remitted from Bahrain cost much more in terms of deaths than a similar amount remitted from UAE. The data suggests that that blue-collared workers are contributing more to India’s FOREX kitty than the white-collared workers in the developed countries. Indian workers in the UAE remitted USD 72.3 billion between 2012-2017, while remittances from Indians in USA were only USD 68.37 billion during this period. However, because of the disproportionate political influence wielded by Indian expatriates and NRIs in the developed countries, the workers in the Gulf countries go unsung and unacknowledged, despite their sweat, blood, and toil. The Indian government hardly recognises, let alone acknowledges the contributions of Gulf workers, and efforts to help them are scant. In 2014, the MEA tried putting in place a   but as this  , the efforts are piecemeal, fragmented and sluggish, not taking into account the harsh reality of the widely prevalent  system which the International Labour Organization has termed as a   and the severe and rampant violations of labour rights, especially those of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers who go to work there. Apart from that, the government has so far also remained blind to the plight of domestic workers who are subject to rampant exploitation and sexual and mental abuse. Nayak is loathe to call the Gulf remittances “blood money”, but expects the Indian government to be much more cognisant of the plight and contributions of Indian workers in the Gulf countries than it cares to do at present.

Rajan Mahan,"Vasundhara Raje has passed the ‘ticket distribution test’ with flying colours. Her writ runs large in the Rajasthan BJP, as Raje has clearly trumped BJP National President Amit Shah who was at loggerheads with her on the issue of distributing party tickets. The two lists and 162 warriors the BJP has so far fielded for the electoral battle, are packed with Raje loyalists. Besides other calculations, a prime reason for ignoring Shah’s plan to drop a large chunk of sitting MLAs was to prevent a possible revolt that might be ignited if too many MLAs were sidelined. By reposing faith in the party’s old war horses, Raje hoped to scuttle any threat of sabotage by leaders denied party tickets. But that hope has been belied as over a dozen MLAs and some Raje Ministers have openly defied the party in the past few days. After resigning, he blamed the RSS for his ouster and said : Many soon followed Goyal’s example, causing a mini-rebellion within the BJP’s ranks. Among the most prominent names to quit the party is the MP from Dausa, Harish Meena. A former DG Police in Rajasthan, Harish Meena moved to the Congress which is keen to counter the influence of Kirori Lal Meena, a strongman of the tribal Meena community who recently re-joined the BJP and was made a Rajya Sabha MP. The Meena tribe plays a crucial role in over 30 seats of eastern Rajasthan. But with Harish Meena switching to the Congress, the BJP’s desire to woo this major votebank has been crushed. Another major leader who has deserted the BJP is Habibur Rahman, the 5-time sitting MLA from Nagaur who was denied a ticket under the reported BJP plan not to field any Muslim candidates. Rahman has promptly joined the Congress which may now make him a party candidate. Sidelining Muslim leaders seems to be a part of the hardcore Hindutva agenda being set by the RSS. This is also an attempt to push further the politics of  polarisation that the BJP has pursued in Rajasthan in recent years. Word has it that he may finally be ‘sacrificed’. Many are closely watching to see, if despite getting a decisive say, Raje will be able to swing a ticket for her favourite – despite the obvious but unstated RSS plan to deny tickets to all Muslim leaders, along the lines of Uttar Pradesh. Protests by other BJP leaders and cadres have erupted in over a dozen districts since the first list was released. The party office in Jaipur has seen multiple rounds of angry protests, slogan shouting and heated exchanges. A large contingent of policemen has been deployed around the clock to ensure security of the BJP HQ in Jaipur. Besides dropped Ministers, MLAs and their supporters, much of the party cadre is also upset with the ticket distribution – albeit, for a very different reason. For years, most of them have nursed grievances against their local MLAs and ministers, and were hopeful of change – given Amit Shah’s original plan to drop a large number of current MLAs and bring in new faces. A ticket aspirant in Jaipur echoes the anger of many party workers : “Why did our party bosses hold surveys at different levels if their results were to be ignored? When surveys in most areas went against local MLAs, it’s pointless to field them. Leaders who promised to change everything in this election, have betrayed us.” Internally, there are growing worries, but overtly Raje claims the protests will soon be checked. For the moment, the desertion of major leaders and anger among party cadres is spoiling the ‘atmospherics’ for the BJP, as Raje bids to retain power in Rajasthan. As a steady stream of leaders quit their posts and the party, Raje’s task is far from easy. Vasundhara may have won the showdown with Shah and dominated the process of choosing BJP candidates, but as protests escalate in Rajasthan, her is challenge is getting tougher. Whether this gamble woos voters, will be clear only when results get declared on 11 December. As it enters the battlefield, the BJP has a powerful lady-general but a cadre that's far from being charged up.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ashok K Mehta,"The strains and tension in civil-military relations were visible again last week (9-11 November), surprisingly during the commemoration ceremonies of the centenary of the Armistice Day World War I. Prime Minister Modi too tweeted endorsing this sentiment, adding he had been to Haifa and Neuve Chapelle, both World War I memorials to deceased Indians. Yet, our IAS bureaucracy, bereft of strategic culture but beaming with disdain for dignity and decorum of sacred military ceremonials (like their turning the Beating Retreat into a  ) kept the two planned and sanctioned functions, on tenterhooks: cancelling one and giving the go-ahead for the other at the 11th hour. The two solemn events were at India Gate – a joint Indo-British brass band concert being cancelled and the venue having to be shifted to the residence of the British High Commissioner; the second being the laying of wreaths at Delhi’s India Gate memorial of Indian soldiers killed in World War I by a British MP, a former RAF officer Tom Tugendhat, chairman Foreign Affairs Committee, and two British Generals for which permission was needlessly delayed. The elaborate function was virtually boycotted by MoD and MEA with the Army represented by its Ceremonials Division’s Maj Gen Kalita, though the Army Chief’s bungalow at Rajaji Marg is separated from the British High Commissioner’s by a wicker gate. This is in sharp contrast to the 2014 centenary of the start of World War I, when the then UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, the then Indian Defence Minister Arun Jaitley and Army Chief Gen Dalbir Singh attended identical functions with all the pomp and pageantry that accompanies such memorable occasions. This time, the Brigade of Gurkhas and Royal Engineers bands regaled the largely military gathering of retired soldiers, historians and researchers of World War I on the role played by Indian soldiers in the war which has remained unknown until recently. The second part of the commemoration was the returning of war diaries of the British Indian Army regiments of that period to the Colonels of their regiments. These serving general officers were invited but not permitted to attend. Instead senior retired Generals took their place and received the war diaries from former Army Chief Gen VN Sharma who was the chief guest. Gen J J Singh, a former governor, was the other Army chief present. In his speech, Sharma thanked the British High Commissioner, Dominic Asquith, for organising the event and went on to introduce the youthful Tugendhat, who, he said, had an illustrious military background while bemoaning the fact that unlike in the UK, the political class in India did not send their wards to the military. Clearly the British mindset is changing by their belated recognition of the strategic contribution by the Indian Army in a war that was underplayed so far. Similarly there is now belated Indian official acknowledgement of its momentous role in the war (still not ‘our’ war). The Teen Murti Chowk which honours princely states armies has been renamed Teen Murti-Haifa Chowk in a ceremony attended in 2017 by Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. For the first time in Britain, the Flanders poppy, which is worn on Remembrance Day, was made also in  . In India, the marigold has been chosen to signify “India Remembers”, because saffron is often seen as the colour of sacrifice, and the flower too is easily available in the country. This has become law, and embraces particularly the veterans so that they should suffer no disadvantage and be given special consideration. In India, many veterans are still protesting the incomplete implementation of Modi’s crown jewel achievement of OROP. The government’s claim that it has done for the armed forces unlike any other government is hollow: four defence ministers in one government, the lowest defence budgets, no CDS as promised, and the cumulative anomalies of Pay Commissions including the 7th Pay Commission are some deficiencies that dog the exceptionally tolerant and obedient armed forces. But to ensure that there is no repeat of the faux pas one witnessed last week, there is need for institutional change in culture and conduct of the bureaucracy. It is also time the Army made itself count. And all of India wore the marigold at least for one day. ( .      (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Haripriya Suresh Nitin B,"The assets of the first family of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the state has grown by a considerable percentage over the last four years, a look at the affidavits filed by K Chandrasekhar Rao, his son, K Tarakarama Rao, and nephew, Thanneeru Harish Rao in 2014 and 2018 revealed. In his affidavit, KCR also said that he had a net agricultural income of Rs 91,52,657. As far as his movable assets are concerned, KCR has Rs 2,40,000 cash in hand, compared to Rs 9,90,000 in his previous affidavit. His wife has Rs 93,595 cash in hand, compared to Rs 1,50,000 in 2014. His investment of Rs 55,00,000 in Telangana Broadcasting Pvt Ltd (which runs T News) and Rs 4,16,25,00 in Telangana Publication Private Limited (which runs Telangana Today) remains unchanged. His wife, Shobha Rao, owns 2,200 grams of gold, diamonds and valuable gemstones worth Rs 93,66,184, compared to 650 grams worth Rs 19,50,000 in 2014. It must be noted that KCR also has taken loans from KTR and KTR’s wife, which he has shown in the form of liabilities. In 2018, KCR has gross total movable assets of Rs 11,35,37,725 and gross total immovable assets worth Rs 8,88,47,570, which brings his gross total assets to Rs 20,23,85,295. In 2014, the same figures respectively were Rs 6,50,82,464 and Rs 8,65,00,000, which means that his gross total assets were worth Rs 15,15,82,464 four years ago. This means that KCR's assets have increased by 33.514 percent since 2014. KT Rama Rao’s total annual income for the financial year 2017-18 was Rs 74.6 lakh, compared to Rs 29,59,219 in 2014. Cash in hand has decreased for both KTR (Rs 1,42,594 from Rs 6,25,000) and Shaimila (Rs 1,08,231 from Rs 7,56,300). The couple’s bank balance also shot up. KTR’s increased from Rs 3,93,920 in 2014 to Rs 34,36,131. Meanwhile, his wife's bank balance also increased from Rs 20,92,439 to Rs 1,06,98,043. Rs 19,59,692 was also deposited in a bank account on his daughter's name. As far as jewellery is concerned, KTR owns 100 grams of gold worth Rs 2.5 lakh, while his wife owns Rs 3.9 kg of gold ornaments and diamonds worth Rs 1,09,05,000 – an increase from 3.5 kg worth Rs 87,50,000 in 2014. In 2018, KTR and his spouse disclosed total movable assets worth Rs 31,53,59,828 and total immovable assets worth Rs 10,29,34,600 bringing his gross total assets to Rs 41,82,94,428. The numbers respective for 2014 was Rs 5,11,25,759 and Rs 2,87,53,690, bringing his total assets to Rs 7,98,79,449. This means that his total increase in assets is 423.657 percent. In his latest affidavit, Thanneeru Harish Rao's annual income was Rs 20,39,110, as opposed to Rs 6,44,349 in 2014. His wife showed an income of Rs 2,25,03,681 in 2018, compared to Rs 10,54,300 in 2014.

T M Veeraraghav,"Rajinikanth’s personal political inclinations are towards the Bharatiya Janata Party. This is not a new revelation or something that needs to be deciphered from his cryptic comments over the last few days. This has been clear since 2004 when he revealed his endorsement for the BJP-AIADMK alliance in the state. At that time, he did not campaign or seek votes for the alliance, but merely stated that he would vote for the BJP. As it turned out, in the 2004 elections, the AIADMK-BJP combine was routed in Tamil Nadu and could not win even a single parliamentary seat. In fact, the BJP shifted over from the DMK to the AIDMK on the eve of those elections and that decision, party insiders would admit, cost it 40 parliamentary seats. Certainly, things have changed over the last 14 years. But where does Rajinikanth stand now and even if that is clear does it matter? Firstly, Rajinikanth still remains the reclusive star that he was, and the metamorphosis into a politician seems very uncertain. Almost a year after the South superstar announced that he will enter politics, he is yet to launch his political party. So, true to Rajinikanth’s own admission, he is not yet a politician. This is important because as the 2004 precedent shows that just statements of support from Rajinikanth does not have electoral impact. He needs to be a full time politician first, before hoping to make an impact. Second, while Rajinikanth’s recent comments, inferring that the BJP is “strong” because it is facing all other parties alone, may reiterate his inclination towards the BJP and Narendra Modi, it is also true that his last film   portrayed him as a character taking on a Hindutva politician promising economic growth. In fact, the antagonist in the film was a character who bore a likeness to the PM’s persona. The film did raise fresh questions over whether Rajini was making an effort to shed an image of being close to the BJP and reiterating that he is not a Hindutva mascot. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has stitched up a powerful alliance with the Congress, left parties, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazagam(MDMK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Indian Union Muslim League(IUML). The DMK has already portrayed the elections as a battle between Dravidian political philosophy, championed by it, and Hindutva as a divisive force. Now, the BJP’s hope seems to be to piggy back in the southern state, where it has negligible presence, on an alliance bringing together AIADMK factions, and parties like the PMK which have been left out by the DMK. It hopes Rajinikanth as a political entity would be part of such an alliance and perhaps lead it as the mascot, behind whom these parties can unite. But the reality is not that simple. Firstly, the ruling AIADMK faction is in total disarray and is held together only because it was in power when Late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa passed away. It seems to have little credibility in the state, and Rajinikanth himself has questioned it on issues like the controversy around fellow actor Vijay’s blockbuster film  . Allying with such a dispensation will dent Rajinikanth’s credibility. It must be recalled here that, in his speech announcing a political entry, Rajinikanth had said his party would contest in all 234 assembly constituencies in the state. This cannot be different in a parliamentary election, and if he does get his party in place, the expectation will be that it will contest in all seats. This apart, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) has had serious differences with Rajinikanth in the past. This dates back to 2004 when PMK workers even attacked Rajinikanth fans and issued public statements against him. Even as recently as 2017, PMK leader Anbumani Ramadass had said Rajni should not aim to rule the state as there were “more efficient” leaders to do so. So, it may be difficult for Rajni to ally with both the AIADMK and PMK. Given that the Opposition has arithmetic in its favour, an alliance between Rajini and the BJP alone may be a non- starter, and it will further brand Rajinikanth as the ‘Hindutva face’ in Tamil Nadu. He may be a spiritualist and Hindu, but does not want to be branded communal or against Dravidian principles. Such a branding would alienate Rajinikanth from the masses in the state. So, there are conflicting priorities at play here. Rajinikanth is unpredictable, and often retreats into silence when there is too much controversy around him. Thus, the possibility that he may want to stay away from the parliamentary elections and pick up the pieces later, in an assembly election, is a strong one. Having said that, to quote one of the most famous Rajinikanth film dialogues, “I will never tell you how or what I will do. You will know only when I do it”. Can he pull off such an act in real life politics ahead of 2019? Seems unlikely, but only Rajinikanth knows his script!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Avinash Kalla,"The election bugle has been sounded in Rajasthan, with the Bhartiya Janta Party releasing its list of 131 candidates for the assembly elections. While the names suggest an advantage to Vasundhara Raje, the same can’t be said for the BJP. With 85 MLAs set to contest again, the much-hyped theory that BJP National President Amit Shah would be in charge of ticket distribution, has gone out of the window. Once again, Raje’s will prevails, and this sets the tone for the upcoming elections. Let’s see how this might work out and what implications it might have. Over the last fortnight, names of probables, criteria for selections have been the bone of contention between Shah and Raje. As per reports, Shah’s survey suggested that the names proposed by Raje don’t fit the “winnability clause”, and he wasn’t happy with what was offered. This didn’t go well with Shah and he returned the list for reconsideration, owing to which, a miffed Raje went back to Jhalawar in Rajasthan and locked herself up. But on the night of 11 November, Raje emerged as the winner in the first bout of candidate selection. She persisted with the time-tested old names to safeguard herself in case BJP miraculously reversed the trend of coming back to power, second time in row. If this is the scenario post 11 December, Raje, with the old guard, would be better placed to hold fort in Rajasthan. It’s a clear edge to Raje so far as ticket distribution is concerned, but insiders in the RSS suggest that the list is balanced and their demands and agenda have been considered. Others like Kalicharan Saraf, Rajpal Singh Shekawat don’t feature in the list. Rural development minister Surinder Goyal lost his seat, but ministers with RSS background like Arun Chaturvedi, Vasudev Devnani and Gulab Chand Kataria will be contesting from their constituencies, namely, Civil Lines, Jaipur,Ajmer North, and Udaipur respectively. While the MLAs have been lucky, the fate of many Cabinet ministers including the ones mentioned above, hangs in the balance. The most notable being Yunus Khan. Khan has been the lone Muslim face and was the closest minister to Raje. His ticket being held back is likely to be a bone of contention between Raje and RSS over the next few days. The grapevines have it that Saraf too didn’t score well on the RSS parameters, hence in limbo. ‘Dynasty’ has been the favourite punching bag of the BJP when it comes to taking potshots at the Congress. However, this time around, of the 131, there have been a notable 11 constituencies where the BJP has decided to field the kins of their incumbent candidates. Ramswaroop Lamba, son of former MP late Sawar Lal Jat (who lost the Ajmer Lok Sabha by-polls), Atul Bhansali (nephew of Jodhpur MLA Kailash Bhansali), Gurmit Singh Barar (grandson of Gurjant Singh), Sailesh Singh (son of late Digambar Singh), Poonam Kanwar (daughter-in-law of Devi Singh Bhati) have been fielded. Also reports claim that eight to ten dissidents from places like Kekri, Masuda in Ajmer and Mandalgarh in Bhilwara among others, will be contesting as independents. With a mere 69 seats left to be declared, pushing fresh faces in the arena would do little good. The rank and file, and the dissidents were thinking ticket distribution would leave some space and chance for them to up the ante to reverse the anti-incumbency trend.

Akanksha Kumar,"Around 78 lakh new jobs were created in the formal sector between April 2016 and September 2018, under the flagship scheme of the NDA government –   – said the Ministry of Labour in response to an RTI filed by  . 77,83,658 employees have benefited, between April 2016 and September 2018, under the Centre’s PMRPY, said the Ministry of Labour in its response to the RTI query. The ministry further claimed that 96,921 establishments across 36 states and Union Territories have benefited from the scheme till 30 September 2018. Data provided by the Ministry of Labour shows that Maharashtra has the highest number of beneficiaries at 13,85,671 followed by Tamil Nadu (9,24,680), Karnataka (7,38,692), Gujarat (7,02,142) and Haryana (6,56,574). Among the states going to polls, Chhattisgarh has 80,475 employees who have benefitted from the scheme, while for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the figures stand at 2,99,776 and 2,27,799 respectively. The Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched by the BJP-led government in 2016. Under the scheme, the government agreed to pay 8.33 percent of employers' contribution towards EPF for new employees who have joined on or after 1 April 2016. The scheme was applicable only for those employees who have a salary of up to Rs 15,000  . It is one of the flagship schemes launched by the Centre in a bid to create more jobs by offering an incentive to the employers. The government had allocated a budget of Rs 1,000 crore for this scheme in 2016. An organisation applying for benefits under the PMRPY has to be registered with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). According to the figures provided by the National Data Centre (EPFO), 87,015 establishments have been covered under the scheme between August 2016 to August 2018. So, basically the government counts all the new PF holders who have enrolled under the PMRPY as new employees who have joined the workforce since 2016. In February 2016, during his budget speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced government’s new policy on job creation. Under the sub-head, ‘Job creation’, Jaitley went on to elaborate in his budget speech how the government’s new incentive policy for employers will generate new jobs: The figure for EPF contribution was revised to 12 percent in the Budget 2018-19. But the method of counting new jobs based on new PF (Provident Fund) holders has been under the scanner with experts questioning the veracity of data. Consider this, an organisation with 20 employees or more needs to register for PF contribution, and so if a workplace that had 19 employees till 1 April 2016, and has inducted one employee later, will count all the 20 employees as ‘beneficiaries’, with the government bragging about 20 new jobs. However, only one new job has been created in that organisation. In September 2018, a team of researchers at Bangalore’s Azim Premji University released the ‘State of Working India (SWI)’ report which claimed that unemployment is the highest in India since last 20 years. On the issue of ambiguity regarding EPF (Employees’ Provident Fund) numbers, Amit Basole, lead author of the SWI 2018 report and Professor of Economics, says, “It’s hard to tell whether these are new jobs,” adding: Details about the implementation of the scheme indeed seem to be sketchy as apprehended by Basole. To a query regarding the methodology used for counting the number of beneficiaries, the ministry has responded by saying: (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Rajan Mahan,"The big surprise by the Congress party has made it the ‘big fight’ of the Rajasthan elections, which pits Manvendra Singh, son of former BJP stalwart Jaswant Singh, against Vasundhara Raje. The Jhalrapatan seat in Jhalawar district will now be the arena for the ‘grudge match’ between Chief Minister Raje and the Jaswant Singh family. And the heavy political missile launched by the Congress will now be the most keenly watched contest of the desert state. For years, the cold war between Vasundhara Raje and the Jaswant Singh family has been the stuff of legend in Rajasthan politics. Now, for the first time, the two sides will directly square off in the electoral battle. This will be no ordinary poll battle, with a dramatic mix of ego, pride and politics at play. The grudge match involves a deep personal and political family feud that has raged on for over a decade. While the personal and the political are deeply inter-twined in this battle, first a quick word on the electoral calculus behind the Congress deploying Manvendra. With the spectre of anti-incumbency vote haunting the BJP, this is a clever move to derail Raje’s campaign and confine her energies in her own Jhalrapatan constituency. The strategy aims at forcing Vasundhara to spend more time in her own fortress in order to check her – as far as possible - from campaigning on other seats in the state. This seems to be the prime reason why Manvendra was fielded in Raje’s backyard, rather than his own political turf of Barmer-Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan. The Congress also hopes that fielding Manvendra, a prominent Thakur leader, will help to en-cash the anger of Rajputs with the Raje government over several issues. Many experts believe a Rajput backlash could erupt strongly as the community is upset with Raje’s mishandling of the “Padmaavat” film row, the police encounter of Rajput strongman Anandpal and most recently, over her stalling Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, from becoming the state BJP president earlier this year. The inept handling of contentious issues related to the Rajput community has been magnified as an insult to the community’s pride and Manvendra Singh is sure to play up the humiliation of Jaswant Singh as a matter of ‘Swabhiman’ or Self Respect of Rajputs to dislodge his formidable foe. This brings us back to the bad blood between Raje and the Jaswant Singh clan which lends a special edge to the electoral clash in Jhalarapatan. A fortnight ago, The Quint had discussed the deep roots of this rift at length. Suffice to say now that the Jaswant Singh-Vasundhara Raje cold war has been full of bitterness, with charges of betrayal flying around for well over a decade now. The deep differences that turned the two friends into permanent foes could make for an enthralling political novel. Political observers in the desert state know how the two sides have rarely lost an opportunity to embarrass each-other. Inevitably, after being declared the Congress candidate, Manvendra lost no time in attacking Raje: “She ( Raje ) doesn’t belong to Jhalarapatan. She is a Rajasthani by marriage, not birth. In that sense, she is an outsider, though she has been here for many years. In that sense, I am more Rajasthani than she is,” he said. Despite all the attacks and calculations, it must be remembered that Jhalawar has been Raje’s fortress for decades. She has won the Jhalarapatan seat since 2003, which is a part of the Jhalawar Lok sabha constituency, that Vasundhara won 5 times and has been held by her son Dushyant since 2004. As such, the task facing Manvendra is more than tough. No wonder, on Manvendra being fielded against her, Raje retorted: As the Raje-Manvendra battle lines get drawn, it’s clear that Jhalrapatan will see a high-stakes, high-voltage campaign. A fascinating facet of the Jhalrapatan battle is that Rama Pilot, the mother of Sachin Pilot, the current Congress Chief in Rajasthan had also fought against Vasundhara Raje in 2003. If Sachin and Manvendra can now combine to trump Raje, that will be sweet revenge, indeed in more ways than one. As the personal turns political, the Vasundhara Raje-Manvendra Singh clash promises to be a battle royale.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Papri Das,"I am a 27-year-old politically aware citizen of India who has never voted in her life. Why? ‘Cause I am what you’d call an internal migrant – someone who has moved from one place to another for education, livelihood or other reason. Like me, there are 139 million internal migrants (including those who have moved within a state and those who have moved out of a state) if you go by the 2011 census. So what holds back internal migrants like me from exercising their voting rights? Well, time and money. The exceptions being voters on election duty, service voters and special voters –people working for the Indian army or the Govt of India but are posted away from their constituency – and wives of the aforementioned people.  is a detailed list. Since I am none of the above: For me to cast my vote, I have to take a leave from work for at least three days, book a flight or a train to West Bengal from New Delhi. The entire process will cost me anything north of Rs 5,000 by moderate estimates. While this figure may vary for the rest of the 43.37 cr people in India who identify as an internal migrant, why should there be any sort of poll tax to exercise my right as a citizen? It turns out that apart from the above mentioned list, there is another group that is allowed to vote remotely – the NRIs. Yes, as of 2017, the Non-Resident Indians can cast their vote in Indian elections remotely through a method of proxy voting. Setting up remote polling stations, Internet voting, and postal ballots were also considered but rejected due to security, privacy and logistical reasons. So why was the proxy voting never considered for the 139 million internal migrants in the country? I reached out to Vinod Zutshi, former deputy election commissioner, to understand this better. This is what he had to say: I could enlist my name in a new voter’s list that simply? This was news to me. “Every time you move, you have to request the Electoral Registration Officer of the constituency you have moved to, to enroll your name in the voter list of that particular constituency, and delete your name from the voter list of your previous constituency,” Zutshi further clarified. But this method can be repeated as many times as one moves out of their polling station area, as long as a valid address proof of the new location is provided. Valid address proof may include any government ID like passport, Aadhaar, etc, bank passbook, or even utility bill such as electricity bill or gas connection under one's own name. Duly registered rental documents are also considered as address proof when enrolling to a fresh voter list. Here’s a full list of documents accepted as address proof. While doing house to house survey, if it is found that a person on the voter list does not reside in the address mentioned in their records, their name may also be taken off from the list after sending them notice. But was this method really as simple as the former deputy election commissioner makes it to be? To find out, I logged in to the ECI website and applied, and… ...failed. The website simply couldn’t upload the documents I had submitted as my identity, age and address proof (a passport size photo, my Aadhaar card, and my gas bill). In the age when even political campaigns are happening over WhatsApp groups, I wasn’t able to submit a simple online form seamlessly. The last resort was to download the form, fill it manually and physically present it to the election register officer of my area, which was cumbersome to say the least, but the only choice. I did so on 12 November. As I wait for the authorities to tell me if my name made it to the new list or not, tell us in comments if you will go through the ‘due process’ to enlist your name on a new voter’s list, or prefer an easier way out to cast your vote.

Mayank Mishra,"Compare the two scenarios: With a modest vote share of 37 percent, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate had won Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 general elections. The constituency, with an estimated 50 percent Muslim voters, has a long tradition of electing a Muslim member of Parliament. However, of the 12 candidates in the fray then, seven were Muslims. All major parties, except the BJP, had nominated Muslim candidates, leading to a fragmentation of the votes of the minority community. But that was 57 months ago when there were fancy layers of this worldly promise of jobs and eradication of black money on the relatively subdued Hindutva narrative. Cut to the 2018 by-election for the Kairana Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) candidate, a Muslim, won the seat by securing nearly 52 percent of the votes polled. The seat is estimated to have 38 percent Muslim voters and the combined Opposition candidate perhaps got bulk of those votes and more, despite the presence of two other Muslim candidates in the fray. The two examples given here indicate a shift, and a politically very significant one at that, in the way Muslims have been voting thus far. The latest name changing exercise, intended to do away with remnants of the composite culture with clear Islamic imprint, is one of the many manifestations of aggressive Hindutva. Through Kairana, Muslims have perhaps signalled that voting together for a particular candidate/party is going to be a new normal. Let us look at some data first. The country has 14 Muslim-majority Lok Sabha constituencies. While Assam has maximum four such constituencies, West Bengal and Jammu & Kashmir have three each, Kerala has two and Bihar has one. The Lakshadweep seat is yet another Muslim-majority constituency. Additionally, there are 13 seats where Muslims constitute more than 40 percent of the population. If we combine the two, we can say that in as many as 27 Lok Sabha seats, Muslim votes alone can ensure victory of parties or candidates they wish to vote for. According to reliable estimates, there are as many as 101 Lok Sabha seats where Muslims constitute more than 20 percent of the electorate. In fact, in nearly 50 Lok Sabha seats, Muslims make up for almost a third of total voters. According to a   by  , Muslim MPs got elected from only seven states and one union territory, and as many as 22 states and six union territories did not elect a single member of Parliament in the last general elections! My   shows: “An analysis of six recently constituted state Assemblies and the Lok Sabha shows that there has been a fall of nearly 35 percent in the number of Muslims elected. The states are Maharashtra, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. Together they account for 968 Assembly seats. The number of MLAs belonging to the minority community in these states has dropped from 35 to 20 between the two elections. And the tally of Muslim MPs at 22 is at an all-time low in 62 years. Only the first general elections saw fewer Muslims entering the Lok Sabha.” My research showed that there was 5 percent increase in the number of Muslim candidates in 2014 compared to the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. And there was identical increase in case of Maharashtra Assembly elections the same year. But that was another era when some parties were blamed for their so-called minority appeasement (I don’t know why this phrase gained currency as numbers never suggested anything close to any appeasement). Many renowned scholars had talked about the growing urge among Muslims to join the mainstream. That members of the minority community had begun to venture into rapidly growing businesses, which recommendations of the Sachchar Committee gave us enough hint on. The new-found economic empowerment, despite the government, further fragmented them politically and quite rightly so. And the growing chorus of denigrating anything and everything associated with Muslims has only added to the despondency. Hence, the realisation to make their votes count. While the elusive Hindu consolidation has never happened and unlikely to ever happen, if growing despondency forces Muslims to vote as a block, the BJP will find it extremely tough to come anywhere close to even a simple majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

PTI,"Opposition leader Sharad Yadav said on Sunday, 18 November, that the BJP’s hope to return to power at the Centre will be buried in the same states — Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — which had propelled it to a big win in 2014. He also asserted that the Congress will trump the saffron party in all the five poll-bound states. The results of the assembly polls, including BJP-ruled Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, will lay the foundation for the Lok Sabha elections next year, he told   in an interview. People want to get rid of the Narendra Modi-led government as it has not fulfilled a single promise made to them 2014, Yadav claimed. “The Congress is in the driving seats in all the five states. People are under distress and want to defeat the BJP. The results of these (assembly) polls will lay the foundation stone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” he said. Working to forge an alliance of opposition parties and win over new allies against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, Yadav said they will be united in 2019. The NDA had won 104 of the 120 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in 2014 but a likely alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) has made things much more challenging for the BJP in the politically most crucial state that sends 80 members to the lower house of Parliament. The BJP has boosted its prospects in Bihar by allying with Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) President Nitish Kumar, who had fought against it in 2014, but the opposition is working to shore up its support by wooing leaders from the NDA camp. Yadav had recently met RLSP leader and BJP ally Upendra Kushwaha, and there is speculation that his Loktantrik Janata Dal and the RLSP may merge to boost the opposition alliance. He declined to comment on the matter but Kushwaha’s drift from the NDA is becoming increasingly evident as he said on Saturday, 17 November, that the number of seats offered to him by the BJP for the Lok Sabha polls is not “respectable”, setting the deadline of November 30 to the saffron party to sort out the matter. Attacking Modi for “chasing the Congress with a lathi day in and day out” while “not fulfilling his promises”, Yadav said the Prime Minister rakes up sentimental issues like his tea-seller background to target the main opposition party. The Congress was defeated in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the subsequent assembly elections. There cannot be a bigger punishment for a party than this, he said. Whether it was the BJP’s promise on generating employment or boosting the economy and cleaning the Ganga river, none of it has been fulfilled, he claimed and alleged that instead, measures like demonetisation hit people hard and the GST “destroyed” small traders. These are the real issues on the ground, besides distress of farmers and high oil prices, he said while reiterating that the assembly polls will boost the opposition and set the tone for the Lok Sabha polls. Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram are due on November 26, and in Rajasthan and Telangana on 7 December. Chhattisgarh had gone to the polls for 18 seats on 12 November and polling for the remaining 72 seats will be held on 20 November. Counting of votes for all the five states is due on 11 December.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"The first phase of Jammu and Kashmir panchayat elections recorded 74% percent voter turnout on Saturday, 17 November, even as some parts of the Valley observed a shutdown called by the separatists. Kashmir Divisional Commissioner, Baseer Ahmad Khan, told   that no incidents of violence or disruptions were reported during polling hours on Saturday, but a Panchayat Ghar in Kupwara’s Nutnusa was torched by miscreants in the evening. In the 86 Panchayat Halqas of Rathsun, two candidates were declared winners without a contest and there was no polling in the remaining 84  . Out of the 10 Sarpanch  of the region, three candidates won unopposed while no one filed nominations for the other 7 seats. Polling officials said that the turnout was 70% in Kupwara district, 69.1% in Baramulla, 56.20% in Bandipora, 30.14% in Budgam and 21.80% in Srinagar. In the Ladakh region, 77.7% turnout was recorded in Kargil district and 60% in Leh. With the aggregate turnout of 64.1%, as many as 1.05 lakh exercised their right to vote in Kashmir division, that includes Kargil and Leh districts of Ladakh. An overall turnout of 79.5% was recorded in Jammu division as 2.35 lakh out of 2.95 lakh residents cast their votes.

Nearly 5,000 sarpanches are also in the fray. Polling will be conducted in nine phases from 17 November to 11 December. Unlike the urban local body (ULB), Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, panchayat elections in Jammu and Kashmir are held on a non-party, non-political basis. The National Conference and the Poeples Democratic Party (PDP) had boycotted the ULB and panchayat elections over alleged “tinkering” with Article 35-A. However, members of both the parties were seen contesting or voting on Saturday. J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik complimented the civil and police administration for ensuring fair and peaceful polling across the state on Saturday. He said that the high turnout was proof of a clear mandate by the people of the state. The Governor added he was hopeful that voters will participate in the next 8 phases of the elections to ensure a newly-empowered Panchayati Raj System in Jammu and Kashmir. Panchayat elections were last held in the state in 2011. Polling could not be held since 2016 due to unrest in the Valley after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in July that year. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"In the 2014 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP had set a target of winning more than 44 seats in the House of 87 members, thus, forming a government of its own in the country’s only Muslim-majority state. It bagged an unprecedented 25, but   in the Hindu-dominated Jammu division. In the 50 segments in Muslim-dominated Kashmir and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh, it failed to win a single seat. It was for the first time since Sajjad’s father Abdul Gani Lone’s plunge into electoral politics in 1967 that someone from his legacy won two seats. In four years of his victory, thanks to BJP’s unflinching support, Sajjad Lone, it is being speculated in some political circles, as the next chief minister in Jammu and Kashmir, even though he has never staked such a claim publicly. Lone served as a Cabinet Minister from BJP’s quota in the PDP-BJP coalition, first headed by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and later by Mehbooba Mufti, till it ended prematurely on 19 June this year. Since the Assembly has not been dissolved and it has just been put under suspended animation, speculations of the BJP forming a new coalition with ‘dissidents’ from PDP and other parties have been fluctuating during the Governor’s rule. Nevertheless, several BJP leaders are on record, having asserted that their party could form government if the number of its MLAs and allies touched the magic figure of 44. Lone’s unparalleled advantage is being the alliance’s only ‘presentable’ Muslim face in the Muslim-majority state that has never seen a non-Muslim Chief Minister. For two months after Mehbooba Mufti’s exit as chief minister, speculations were rife that “over 20 MLAs” from her party would support BJP to install Lone as the next head of the government. On a couple of occasions, people even began distributing the portfolios. But the crescendo plummeted the day Mehbooba carried along a brigade of her MLAs and MLCs to A B Vajpayee’s funeral. Of the five ‘dissidents’ in her party of 28 MLAs, Mehbooba managed to win back two—Javed Hassan Baig and Abdul Majeed Paddar. Three of her MLAs— Shia leaders Imran Reza Ansari and his uncle Maulvi Abid Ansari and Mohammad Abbas Wani— are still openly supporting the BJP-PC axis. Yet another PDP MLA, Haseeb Drabu, is known to be upset with Mufti. He has not attended any of PDP’s meetings after his unceremonious dismissal as Finance Minister in March 2018 and has publicly declined to accept a party position. But he has not been seen with PDP’s rivals either. “It will never happen until the BJP high command takes a leaf out of the Congress’s history of political engineering,” said an analyst with reference to 1953, when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru engineered a split in Sheikh Abdullah’s National Conference to install Bakhshi Ghulam Mohammad as Prime Minister of J&K, and 1984 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi got Farooq Abdullah dismissed with defections in NC and the installation of Ghulam Mohammad Shah as chief minister. If well-placed political sources are to be believed, there is a huge difference of opinion in the BJP-RSS fold, as several top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are categorically against using a “Congress formula” to fulfill the ambition of ruling the country’s only Muslim-majority state. At least two senior BJP leaders revealed to   on condition of anonymity that there was “no question of offering money, Cabinet berths or any other privileges” to any MLA. “These have been the traits of the Congress party. BJP doesn’t believe in such dirty tricks,” said one BJP leader who claimed that his party would not expose itself to criticism, more so ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. “These rumours and speculations are limited to Srinagar. Here in Delhi, we are concerned about nothing but parliamentary elections,” he asserted. NC’s and PDP’s boycott of the recent municipal elections over the issue of Article 35-A, has indeed provided some space to Lone’s PC which found convenient to occupy the urban local body in Handwara. Five of PC’s nominees were returned without polling, as nobody filed candidature in their wards. The party won eight seats by contest. However, the district headquarters of Kupwara and PC’s second Assembly segment was swept by the independent candidates, fielded by the PDP Rajya Sabha member Mir Mohammad Fayaz’s brother. But the much-engineered contest in Srinagar Municipal Corporation, in which BJP’s national General Secretary Ram Madhav played a significant role, came as a big morale-booster for Lone. Former NC spokesman Junaid Azim Mattu was elected as the Mayor, as 40 councillors out of 74, mostly independent, voted for him days after he resigned from Omar Abdullah’s party and returned to Lone’s camp. One of them got a total of 8 votes. Congress won 15 seats. Some well-connected politicians insist that even the son of a senior NC leader got six to eight of his ‘proxies’ elected from downtown Srinagar and finally sold them off to a BJP leader to benefit Mattu. Some political and social media circles dismissed these elections as a “fixed match” while referring to one of Governor Satya Pal Malik’s interviews in which, days before the counting, he had said that a “foreign educated youth” was likely to become the mayor in Srinagar. Ram Madhav, Lone, three members of the Ansari family, two of PDP’s ‘dissident’ MLCs and even a senior Congress leader’s businessman son, attended the celebration for Mattu at an eminent hotel. A few days later, when Ram Madhav on Twitter asked NC and PDP to make clear if they would also boycott the next assembly elections, Omar Abdullah retorted that the two conventional mainstream parties would not give Team Madhav the luxury of a walkover. He claimed that the nominees of the BJP and its allies had won some seats in the urban local body elections, only due to the two parties’ boycott. Polling was held in less than 200 out of nearly 600 wards, as most of the wards either went blank or had single candidates in the fray. Madhav, Lone and his former ministerial colleague Imran Ansari have made frontal attacks on NC and PDP while challenging their “dynastic monopoly” over mainstream politics in Kashmir. But their tirade has had a limited impact for more than one reason. None other than Madhav was the architect of BJP’s coalition with PDP, which had been publicly berated by Prime Minister Modi as “ ” (the party of a father and his daughter). Lone and Ansari served as ministers in the same coalition. Apparently to win more favour with BJP, this new political amalgam has also targeted Congress, holding it responsible for all “electoral rigging and manipulations” in Kashmir. Interestingly, the fathers of both the young leaders have been veteran politicians, who not only pioneered the challenge to Sheikh Abdullah and his NC, but also created their own legacy and dynasties. Both were originally creations of the Congress party, contested and won several elections in the most challenging circumstances and both functioned as ministers. So calling their successors ‘underdogs’ would be inaccurate. Abdul Gani Lone served four terms as MLA before switching over to separatist politics in 1990. In the 1967 Assembly elections, he was declared elected on a Congress ticket from Handwara. In the 1972 Assembly elections, he again returned as the Congress candidate from Handwara, getting 24,291 votes. Both these elections are known to have been rigged by the Congress as nomination papers of most of the Opposition candidates were rejected. In the 1983 Assembly elections, senior Lone lost to NC’s Chowdhary Mohammad Ramzan from Handwara— both got over 17,500 votes— but he defeated NC’s Ghulam Qadir Mir in Karnah. Even as Ramzan retained Handwara in 1987, 1996 and 2008, Lone’s proxy, Mohiuddin Sofi, was returned in 2002 and inducted as Forest Minister in Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s PDP-Congress coalition. Finally, in the assembly elections of 2014, Sajad Lone defeated arch rival Ramzan from Handwara. This time around, PC’s fortress extended to Kupwara. In the criss-cross of claims and counterclaims, Sajjad Lone asserts that he has struggled hard to revive the PC and has not got his successes on a platter. In the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, his party’s performance will determine his fate in electoral politics. In case he emerges as winner and BJP retains power at the national level, nobody will be able to stop him from becoming an alternative to the “bad dynasts” —Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.       ) (What does the first-time woman voter want?

He further said that he would no longer push for a meeting with anyone from the BJP, save for PM Narendra Modi. Earlier in the day, Kushwaha had said that the seat-sharing arrangement among the ruling NDA constituents in Bihar was “disrespectful to his party”, and warned that a continued rift over seats would be detrimental to the NDA. He said that he had attempted to negotiate with BJP president Amit Shah over the seat sharing arrangement but to no avail. He had added that his party was willing to wait till 30 November before deciding on further action. “I will also try and meet PM Narendra Modi to seek his intervention,” Kushwaha added. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's ""insulting remark” on Kushwaha was also discussed in his party's meeting in Patna on Saturday. The RLSP leader attended his party's state executive meeting, and BJP sources said any meeting between the two leaders before that is unlikely. Kushwaha had left for Delhi from Patna on Thursday, tweeting that he had sought an appointment with Shah to discuss the issue of seat-sharing and also his alleged humiliation by Kumar. Speaking to reporters in the national capital, Kushwaha claimed that his party wanted its share of seats in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 to be commensurate with its ""increased"" strength compared to the 2014 polls when it had contested on three seats. The BJP has indicated that it is unlikely to spare more than two seats for him. Kushwaha also repeated his allegation that Kumar had called him ' ' (lowly). He had responded to a journalist's query about Kushwaha's claim that Kumar did not want to continue as chief minister after the 2020 Assembly polls. The RLSP leader alleged that Kumar referred to him as ' ', a charge vehemently denied by the JD(U) which also released videos of the event. He also claimed that Kumar wants to destroy his party. The RLSP chief's aggressive comments against Kumar and his attack on Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi for defending of the CM has signalled his growing isolation in the coalition.

Mercurial RLSP leader Nagamani echoed the prevailing mood on the eve of the meeting with a cryptic remark, ""There will be a big explosion in a day or two"".

Darlene Superville Catherine Lucey,"It turns out there is more than one Trump who can employ a few well-chosen words as a poison dart. With a bombshell public statement this week, it was first lady Melania Trump who revealed her ability to carry out a political hit. Her extraordinary call for the removal of a top administration official forced the president to banish a top aide, exacerbated tensions within the White House and provided fresh insight into the first marriage. Above all, the moment showed that the enigmatic first lady is increasingly prepared to flex her muscles. And while first ladies have long held unique positions of influence in the White House, Mrs Trump's very public power play was an unusual move befitting an unconventional White House. Jellison and others said the best comparison would be Nancy Reagan's conflict with White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan. But while that clash eventually became well known, Mrs Reagan never issued a public statement. Mrs Trump, who appeared with her husband Friday at a White House ceremony to honor Medal of Freedom honorees, did not address the controversy directly. The target of Mrs Trump's ire was Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel, who was said to have clashed with East Wing staff over logistics for the first lady's trip to Africa last month. A White House official said Mrs Trump's staff spent weeks working through ""proper channels"" to seek Ricardel's ouster but that the situation came to a head earlier this week after reporters learned of the friction between Ricardel and the East Wing and began asking questions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations. On Tuesday, the East Wing issued a terse and head-snapping statement about Ricardel: ""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House."" A day later, Ricardel was gone from the White House. The statement from Mrs Trump's office caught some senior White House officials by surprise. Both President Trump's spokeswoman and National Security Adviser John Bolton issued glowing statements about Ricardel. The White House insisted she would move into a new administration role, though it was not clear what that position would be. Privately, insiders acknowledged that there was no way for Ricardel to stay in the West Wing once the first lady made her feelings known. As the week closed, it appeared clear that the situation had heightened already fraught tensions between the two wings of the White House, with senior officials from Chief of Staff John Kelly and Bolton on down unhappy with how Ricardel, a Trump loyalist, was treated. “Well,” she added, “some people, they don’t work there anymore.”Asked if some untrustworthy people still worked in the White House, Mrs Trump replied, “Yes.” The first lady has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is an entirely voluntary role. She opted to stay in New York for the first months of the administration so that the couple's son Barron could conclude the school year and she has kept up a limited public schedule since arriving in Washington. She has also taken pains to set herself apart from the rest of the White House and her husband. She launched an education campaign focused on bullying, despite the fact that the president is famed for verbal combat. She took an ambitious trip to Africa, not long after her husband was pilloried for labeling African nations as ""s***hole countries."" Clearly unafraid to make a deft push back at times, the first lady's office last summer put out a statement praising NBA superstar LeBron James' charitable efforts after the president fired off a tweet questioning the basketball player's intelligence. And when   reported that, Trump was irate that his wife's TV aboard Air Force One was tuned to CNN, her office issued a statement saying Mrs Trump watches ""any channel she wants."" As for the matter of fighting cyberbullying when her husband gets rapped for his cyber habits, the first lady told an online safety conference on Thursday that ""It is not news or surprising to me that critics and the media have chosen to ridicule me for speaking out on this issue, and that's OK."" Before her husband reversed himself and put a halt to family separations at the border, Mrs Trump's office put out a statement saying the first lady ""hates"" to see families separated and expressing hope that ""both sides of the aisle"" can reform the nation's immigration laws.

Mayank Mishra,"Generally, we tend to be dismissive about by-elections. They are considered as one-offs with no impact on the big picture. But what happened in the by-elections in Karnataka was unusual. Not only did the coalition partners, the Congress and the JD (S) in this case, worked in tandem and ensured perfect transfer of votes, the anti-BJP group notched up extremely high percentage of votes. Congress voters supported the candidates of the JD(S) and vice-versa. Of the five seats – three Lok Sabha and two Assembly – that went to the polls, the Congress-JD(S) alliance bagged four. And the winning combination got votes in excess of 60 percent at all the places. Since these are extraordinary results, they are bound to impact the 2019 LS elections. Karnataka has been very crucial for the BJP's forays south of the Vindhyas. The saffron party had done well in the last two Lok Sabha elections in the state.  They had won 17 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014.  However, if your opponent is getting a vote share in excess of 60 percent and more (which is what we saw in the bypolls), you don't stand a chance. If the by-election trend persists in 2019, the BJP may face heavy reverses in the state. This means the BJP runs the risk of getting reduced to just a few seats out of the total of 130 in the whole of South India. The question is where will the BJP make up for the potential losses down south. To understand that, we will have to revisit the results of 2014. The BJP then had won all 67 seats on offer in five states. This was achieved in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. In another four states, the BJP had a win percentage of 91 – in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the saffron party had won 122 out of the 134 seats on offer. Can 100 percent or 91 percent record be improved upon? Absolutely not. What about other places then? The BJP is unlikely to better its 2014 performance in Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab and West Bengal. The only realistic chance of some improvement is in the Northeast and Odisha, which together send 40 representatives to the Lok Sabha. All in all, it is unlikely that the BJP is going to improve its performance in 485 LS seats discussed above. What the Karnataka blow suggests is that compensating for the loss is unlikely from other states. It all started from Punjab. And in the recently held Assembly elections in Karnataka and Gujarat, we saw the Congress recovering some lost ground. And all surveys indicate a keen contest between the traditional rivals in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Let us also recall that of the 10 by-election losses the BJP has suffered since 2014, the Congress has won five, indicating an even contest. In the 2014 elections, of the 189 seats which saw straight fight between the Congress and the BJP, the latter had won 166. It was totally a one-sided affair. If the gap reduces, the BJP will have a problem. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Deepika Saraswat,"The latest tranche of US sanctions targeting Iran’s oil exports and transactions between foreign financial institutions and central bank of Iran not only could take billions out of the country’s shrinking revenue stream but also hurt the economic interests of major buyers of Iranian oil. However, Washington granted temporary waivers to nine countries including India, allowing them to buy reduced quantities of Iranian oil. India also secured a waiver on its investment in Iran’s Chabahar port, being developed by New Delhi as an entrepôt for expanding its trade with Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asian republics. As the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Program of Action, JCPOA, hailed as an achievement of multilateral diplomacy, it once again turned to the great power style of dealing with countries on a bilateral or case by case basis, where it is better able to exert pressure and seek concessions. After denying ‘blanket waivers’ to European business operating in Iran, the US approach in granting waivers is about giving countries more time to wind down import of oil from Iran, while also avoiding disrupting global oil markets. Notwithstanding New Delhi’s assurance to Iran that “it follows only UN sanctions and not unilateral sanctions by any other country,’ it had to find its way around the US secondary sanctions, which can punish third-country business entities doing business with Iran by limiting their access to American financial network. Deterred by these sanctions, major Indian private refiners, such as Reliance industries, Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil), and HPCL-Mittal Energy halted purchase of Iranian oil as soon as the US announced its decision to re-instate sanctions. Early on, India decided to get in touch with the European Union, which was working to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that would sidestep the US financial system by providing an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran. But the slow progress on operationalising the SPV and the sharp opposition of the United States to the initiative, denounced by Secretary Pompeo as “one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and international peace and security,” seemed to have pushed India to seek a better understanding with the United States. In the first week of October, the state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd booked Iranian oil for the month of November, the volume was nearly half of what they had imported earlier in preparations for sanctions. Many saw it as India’s willingness to defy US pressure, but the reduction in volume was also an attempt to secure a waiver. When Brian Hook, US special envoy on Iran came to New Delhi to persuade it to slash its imports of Iranian oil, the prospects of shortfall in global supply as a result of embargo on Iranian oil had already sent the oil prices soaring. While the rapid devaluation of rupee against dollar had made it further difficult for the United States to pressurise a country sympathetic to its objectives vis-à-vis Iran. Hook left New Delhi declaring that the two countries share the goal of denying Iran the money it needs to destabilise the region. While the details did not emerge at that time, the two countries had reached a compromise whereby India would be allowed to import Iranian oil, securing its vital economic interests, and Tehran would be denied the ‘hard’ currency it can potentially use to geopolitical games. India will make the complete payment for its Iranian oil imports in an escrow account set up in UCO bank in India, and Iran will have to spend down that amount to pay for its imports from India. The compromise was a significant achievement from the US point of view, given the biggest failing of the JCPOA, according to the Trump administration is that the nuclear agreement provided economic benefits to the Islamic Republic, allowing it to consolidate its destabilising influence in the region. The US Treasury’s decision to exempt Indian investment in Iran’s Chabahar port is hardly surprising, given President Trump’s South Asia strategy, announced in August last year, strongly exhorted India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, especially in the field of economic assistance and development. The railway link between Chabahar and Zahedan on Iran-Afghan border was also exempted from the sanctions. This railway link is to be extended to Mashhad in eastern Iran and thereafter to Central Asia, and is crucial to the trade and transit corridor that would operationalise the potential of the Chabahar port. Now that nine countries have secured waivers to import Iranian oil seem to suggest that repeated declarations by Trump administration to reduce Iran’s oil revenue to zero were more a tactic to create an atmosphere of uncertainty within which waivers negotiations would have to take place. The fact that all the major buyers of Iranian oils are economic heavyweights of Asia, who share the cause of safeguarding free and open international order threatened by Trump’s America first approach, is reflective of an ongoing global transition in which regional powers have increasing space to shape the world.

Revati Laul,"You can tell from the lines on her face. The debris and dead skin weighing it down, as Zakia Jafri has spent fifteen years trying to tell the courts what she saw happening to her husband Ehsan Jafri during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Why not just stand back? Keep your skin in place and forget the courts, is a question worth asking. In fact, worse. It’s choosing to have the life-blood drained out of you slowly, one court verdict at a time. First the lower courts rejected her petition, then the Gujarat high court. Now, on the 19 November, as Zakia prepares to hear what the Supreme Court has to say, I can’t help staring at pictures of her face. I remember the way she looked immediately after the riots. She was on the TV the same week, probably the same day. Her hair was black, her eyes were fierce. She wanted to tell everyone what she had seen. How the mob cut her husband to pieces even after she said he had rung the police commissioner and everyone in the government. She said there had to be a larger conspiracy behind the mobs acting with impunity and that it must link back to the man in charge of the state at the time – Narendra Modi. And then I saw what one year of Modi going from strength to strength did to her face. Since then, Zakia’s face has weathered fifteen years of debris. While the stories around her have focused entirely on the case, I am pausing to reflect on the enormity of it all. It isn’t just the case really but the politics of hate that Zakia is fighting tirelessly against. She is carrying the load for all of us, and needs to be looked at like that. She is fighting against the fear that has become almost normal for Muslims in Gujarat – not just in Ahmedabad but much of the state. As a journalist who has lived in and reported from the state, I have a collection of anecdotes that underscore the importance of Zakia’s fight. The time an autorickshaw driver broke down, convulsed in sobs as he dropped me back home one evening, from the mad throng of Gujarat’s   procession. There were testosterone-displaying muscular men in vests and oiled bodies standing atop trucks as the procession snaked through the walled city, and a few members shouted out insults to Muslims living there, just for the fun of it. To prevent this from descending into violence, these young boys were flanked by a large contingent of police who blew whistles to drown out the provocation. The auto driver said he was Muslim and on a day like this, scared out of his wits. Living in Ahmedabad meant dealing with larger doses of claustrophobia for me in 2015 than it did in 2003. I interviewed young kids for a story on hookah bars being banned. “You need to be in an atmosphere of permissiveness and deviance to hook up with each other right,” I said to a few in a trendy café in town. “So if you can’t drink together and now you can’t even do hookahs, doesn’t it mess with the dating game?” Most of the kids looked incredulously at me, like I had landed from Mars. Like conforming to what mummy-daddy said was the only life they knew or wanted to know. It’s as   she just wrote about the freedom of expression, as a letter to the imprisoned Bangladeshi photographer Shahidul Alam: “It is an attack not on intellectuals, but on intelligence itself.” And then I bring back to the centre of my mind, the other side of Gujarat; the side Zakia and many like her are fighting to keep. The not-so-middle-class and not-so-obedient. Dissent is in their DNA. Criminals and bootleggers and women and men I know, that live in the rudest places. Where they don’t mince their words or their politics. One woman who is the ‘don’ of her ghetto, sat beside me, her ears lit up with fat diamonds. “These people (from the Parivar) come to me regularly, inviting me for this, that and the other. I say to myself, what could possibly make me want to attend their functions? Do they have big d*cks on display or something?” she said, her laughter piercing the night sky with its deviance. “People keep saying, since this is largely a tribal area, the women are in control, the men are all subservient to them. This is an egalitarian space.” She looked at me, shaking with laugher on her  . “Acha, that’s what they tell you?” And then she trashed it the only way she knew. She yanked her daughter in-law from the dark, summoning her to where she sat. “She has been treated so badly by her mother in-law. Starved, given stale food to eat. And they talk about equality? Wait till I see that woman. I will shove chillies in her butt and salt in her c*nt.” Without meaning to, this woman was demonstrating how she was bending patriarchy, one expletive at a time. Then there are the thoroughly disobedient middle-class people. Some conform in principle and privately laugh at those who take the establishment seriously. They nod politely at all that’s being said, and then go and vote against them. The numbers for the BJP dropped sharply in the 2017 assembly elections, and this quiet up-chucking of everything mandated, is at the very heart of it. Where the Sangh Parivar has succeeded, it is appealing to the Gujarati disregard of norms and rules. And that is where it is also starting to fail. After nearly twenty years of the Hindu-right holding the reins of power, they are beginning to see that the same non-observance of rules applies to them. It slowly changes the everyday – with one non-veg meal, one expletive, one court case. Making things a lot less certain, as the Parivar prepares for the big fight in 2019.  ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal governments have withdrawn their ""general consent"" to the CBI to conduct raids and investigations, as the Opposition alleged states were losing faith in central agencies due to their ""misuse"" by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The BJP, however, dubbed it a ""clear malafide exercise of power"" by ""corrupt parties"" to protect their interests. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would now need permission from the respective state governments to carry out any sort of investigation in these states, except those ordered by the courts and against central government officials. Andhra Pradesh government is headed by Chandrababu Naidu of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and West Bengal is ruled by Mamata Banerjee of Trinamool Congress, who are among the key leaders trying to forge a broader 'grand alliance' of opposition parties to fight the BJP unitedly in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister (Home) N China Rajappa told reporters that the reason to withdraw the consent was recent allegations against top CBI officials, while Banerjee said she was extending her support to Naidu as the BJP was using the CBI and other agencies to pursue its own political vendetta. Following suit on Friday evening, the West Bengal government also withdrew its 'general consent' to the CBI to conduct raids or carry out investigations in the state. The CBI functions under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, under which a state government ""routinely"" grants consent to the CBI for exercising its authority in the state, and the AP government, too, had issued relevant orders periodically in the last few years. Ever since he snapped ties with the Modi-led NDA government in March, Naidu has been alleging that the Centre was misusing agencies like the CBI to target political opponents. After recent raids by Income Tax authorities on some business establishments, run by those close to the ruling TDP in the state, Naidu had announced that his government would not provide police cover to the tax officers in their raids. Rajappa claimed that the decision was taken on the advice of lawyers and intellectuals. Rajappa, however, clarified that the CBI could take up investigation against central government officials without the state's permission and also said, ""We will grant necessary permission whenever the CBI makes a request."" In West Bengal, chief minister Banerjee said: The general consent was accorded to the CBI in West Bengal by the then Left Front government in the state in 1989. The BJP termed the Naidu government's decision ""a malafide exercise"" to protect acts of corruption, financial embezzlement and other acts of criminality. He said Trinamool leaders and the Gandhi family of Congress were facing probe in ""corruption"" cases and it has led to a ""convergence of their interests"" with Naidu. He alleged a new ""coalition of the corrupt parties"" was taking shape in the country and the BJP would raise this issue at all political platforms to expose the corrupt deeds of what he dubbed as the newly-minted ""Grand Corrupt Alliance"" (GCA). Opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh also decried the move and asserted that the state government did not have the authority to bar the CBI. The principal opposition YSR Congress alleged the controversial decision was taken only because the chief minister was scared of the CBI. The Congress, however, said the Andhra government's decision shows that states do not have faith in the CBI and other central agencies due to their ""misuse"" by the Modi government. Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too backed Naidu, saying the Modi government was misusing the CBI and the Income Tax department.

PTI,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, 16 November, dared the Congress party to make someone from outside the Gandhi family the party chief at least for five years, for him to believe in Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy. PM Modi was taking a jibe at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s “a   could become prime minister due to Nehru” barb. Addressing a campaign rally for the second phase of Chhattisgarh Assembly elections, Modi slammed the Opposition party for crediting his occupation of the PM's post to Nehru instead of people in the country. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had earlier said it was due to the institutional structure built by Nehru that even a ""chaiwala"" (tea seller) could become India's prime minister. His party colleague Mallikarjun Kharge had also said a ""chaiwala"" could become the prime minister as the Congress preserved democracy. In response to Tharoor’s remarks, Modi charged the Gandhis with still not being able to come to terms with the “son of a poor mother” becoming the country’s prime minister. PM Modi asked the Congress to give an account of what the four generations of the (Gandhi) family did for the nation. ""If this happens, I will accept that Nehru ji created such a democratic system because of which anyone, (even) a dedicated Congressman outside the family could become the Congress chief,"" he said. Modi's five-year tenure remark was apparently in reference to Sitaram Kesri who was the Congress president in the 90s, but did not have a five-year term. He held the post from September 1996 to March 1998. He also hit back at the Congress also for questioning demonetisation, saying the move ""still rankles"" them as the money ""stashed under beds and in sacks"" was taken away in a single stroke. Without naming the Gandhis, Modi said they were unable to come to terms with Modi being the prime minister for four and a half years now ""after their four generations ruled the country"". ""They still keep crying. How could a chaiwala sit (on the PM's chair). How could he? They still cannot fathom how the son of a poor mother could sit on the 'raj gaddi' (throne of power),"" he said. ""You can't understand the difficulties faced by the poor, but a chaiwala can,"" Modi said in a veiled attack on the Congress and the Gandhis. ""They (Congress) have kept the country in the dark with their lies which are ingrained in their minds,"" Modi said, not mincing words to target the principal Opposition party and its top leaders. He also hailed the impressive turnout in the first phase of polling held in the state on 10 November. ""People of Bastar in Chhattisgarh gave a strong response to Naxals by registering record voting percentage in the first phase,"" he added.

Pushan Das,"The storm over the Indian acquisition of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France has received much attention. Most notably for the impact the controversy has had on the political environment in the run-up to the General elections – with accusations of impropriety, including crony capitalism, being levelled against the government. Instead, it opted to buy 36 Rafale aircraft directly through a government-to-government contract. The frequency at which the G2G route being taken by successive governments over the last few years in defence procurement is a testimony to the failure of the present defence procurement policy to deliver and reflects India’s inability to procure through an open competitive process in a time bound manner. There have been a number of instances where crucial acquisition proposals have been cancelled mid-way and retendered thereafter, with some having little success. Governments chose the G2G route to avoid the perceived malpractices of an open competition, this route raises issues around possibility of malpractice in the commercial advantages to single vendors and the elimination of competition. Several revelations have emerged from the controversy over the Rafale order. According to an     in August 2018, a defence ministry review of the selection of the Dassault Rafale as L1 in the earlier contest for 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) was flawed. The review discovered that if the Rafale were to be produced under licence in India (which was an essential requirement of the winning bid under the terms of the original MMRCA RFP), Dassault’s bid would no longer be the L1, or  . The Eurofighter Typhoon would have then become the effective L1. The   (DPP) published in 2016 however says, “In certain acquisition cases, imperatives of strategic partnerships or major diplomatic, political, economic, technological or military benefits deriving from a particular procurement may be the principal factor determining the choice of a specific platform or equipment on a single vendor basis. These considerations may also dictate the selection of particular equipment offered by a vendor not necessarily the lowest bidder (L1). Decisions on all such acquisitions would be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on the recommendations of the DPB.” It was to be an agreement between the two governments, and listed as a separate process from the original MMRCA RFP. The MoD’s inability over the years to put out a set of guidelines to streamline its arms acquisition process has led to a flurry of government-to-government negotiations, with the hope that the procurement cycle becomes less cumbersome, much faster and more importantly less controversial. For example, military equipment is procured from the US in two distinct ways, Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Deals under DCS are purely commercial transactions between a buyer government and the US defence industry, where US companies compete with vendors from other countries to sell their defence equipment. If the request is cleared, a Letter of Offer is sent to the requesting government. The buying government is required to submit a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) along with the initial advance. Thereafter, a legal contract is signed. The US government may supply the item from its own existing stocks or procure it afresh from the concerned equipment manufacturer. The French government provided a “comfort letter” to the Government of India to back the deal instead of a “sovereign guarantee” which essentially reneges it’s of any liability. Thus negating the advantages of a G2G deal where a sovereign state guarantees the contract. The IAF will continue to face serious challenges till at least 2030. The   and procurement controversy comes at a time when ageing legacy fleets  . The IAF’s acquisition of the   and induction of the indigenously-built   will take time to translate into any tangible operational capability.  The old MMRCA Request For Proposal and the piecemeal acquisition of 36 Rafales needs to be taken as a test case, as there are also lessons to be learned to improve the defense procurement process. The frequent use of the G2G route to avoid the perceived malpractices of an open competition needs a revisit as does the practice of sticking to lowest bids or L1 vendors after they are non-compliant to the original conditions of a tender.

Ever since the Congress started its poll campaign in the state, a lot of buzz has been doing the rounds that new candidates will be fielded, those who have rallied over the last five years on ground will be given a fair share in the party’s candidature for assembly elections.  Reports of infighting ruled the first three days of nomination, and finally when the lists were announced, close to 73 out of 152 candidates were ones who had contested the 2013 elections. Credit should be given to the state Congress Chief Sachin Pilot who ensured that despite pressure tactics from the old guard, he was able to manage 65 seats for new faces, and also manage the caste equation. Pilot walked the talk for his national president Rahul Gandhi, making sure that those who had lost two elections don’t manage to get a candidature for the third time around. To the surprise of many, two former chiefs of the party Dr Chandrabhan and BD Kalla, along with 24 others, could not make it to the list. Notably, Harish Meena, the BJP MP from Dausa, who had joined the party a couple of days ago, got a ticket from Deoli-Uniyara, and this was also the case with BJP turncoat, MLA Habibur Rahman. As many as nine candidates who had contested the Madhya Pradesh elections and are sitting MP’s, have been fielded. Former Union Minister Dr C P Joshi, who was aiming to contest the 2019 parliamentary elections from Bhilwara, has been fielded from Nathdwara. Joshi will be returning to his old seat, that which he had held four times, after a decade. Similar is the case with former Rajya Sabha MP Narendra Budaniya, Former Union Minister Girija Vyas, Lalchand Kataria, Raghuveer Meena, Khiladilal Bairwa, Sitting MP Raghu Sharma and Harish meena. From here onwards, the Congress needs to put its house in order, and fast. In less than five minutes of the tickets being declared, the supporters of those who lost their tickets protested at the AICC headquarters. In Bikaner, supporters of senior leader BD Kalla have been asking him to contest as an independent. There is opposition towards Prashant Bairwa how is contesting from Niwai. With three days left for the nominations to be filed and 48 seats left to be announced, the Congress need to act fast on pacifying the rebellion, and ensuring that it keeps the flock together.

Shadab Moizee," Sandeep Suman  Anubhav Mishra The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) had been in power for 15 years in Madhya Pradesh. But before the BJP turned the state saffron with three terms of Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Congress leader Digvijay Singh was the chief minister of the state. Ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls that looks evenly poised according to most pre-poll surveys,   spoke to Digvijay Singh on a plethora of issues like the reported internal conflicts in Congress, ticket distribution, the election manifesto, and more. Will the delay in release name of candidates and party manifesto affect the party? We released our manifesto before the BJP. I don’t know if the BJP has released their manifesto even now. The ticket selection process also took place before BJP’s. So, there was no delay at all.  Will the controversy regarding the mention of RSS shakhas in Congress manifesto affect the party’s chances? You are talking about the wrong issue. We haven’t promised anything new. Even today, no central government officer is allowed to attend an RSS shakha. The Sangh isn’t allowed to open a shakha on the Central government’s premises. This order is followed in the entire country. Past BJP chief ministers like Virendra Kumar Saklecha, Kailash Joshi, Sunderlal Patwa, Uma Bharti or Babulal Gaur [didn’t allow it] and even Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been allowing this for only the last 2-3 years. So you are ignoring 99 percent of our promises but focusing on such issues that are pointless. How will Congress deliver on the over 75 promises in the election manifesto when you claim that the MP government lacks resources? Put us in power and we will tell you. But doesn’t Congress batting for cowsheds while opposing RSS seem like double-speak? No, not at all. Cowsheds were always there, under the panchayat and civil body administration. These people [BJP] had shut them down and we are reopening them. Is RSS the sole representative of Hindus? I am a good Hindu too but I don’t acknowledge RSS as representatives of Hindus. If Congress represents all sections of society then why were only three Muslims given tickets? We at least gave it to three Muslims. On the other hand, BJP has given a ticket to a Muslim candidate for the first time. And we are glad that at least now they have started respecting Muslims. But what about the internal conflicts in your party? We don’t have any internal conflict. In fact, there are internal conflicts in the BJP. So, there is no issue between you and Jyotiraditya Scindia? All of that is a lie. It was a lie spread by you people. There are many seats in Karnataka & Gujarat where the margin of your win was within 1,500 votes. On ground level, BJP had an upper hand in those states. Has Congress taken any lesson from it for MP? There is no such thing, we will get a clear majority in Madhya Pradesh.

According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 11 lakh seasonal migrants out of 50 lakh total migrants from MP.  spoke to a few people who migrated from MP and are now settled in Delhi. We tried to find out if they are going to visit their hometown to vote for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election. And if they do, how do they choose the right candidate to vote for? Maximum number of people migrate from Jhabua, Bhind, Gwalior, Chhattarpur and Tikamgarh districts of MP, which is why in 2013 MP elections, the percentage of votes from these places was low as compared to the total voter turnout of MP, which was fairly high at 72.21 percent. Only 2-4 percent migrants work in the organised sector. For the rest working in the unorganised sector, it becomes a challenge to go back to their hometowns for the elections. The chief election commission of MP had ordered the district magistrates to employ the migrants under MNREGA so they could stay back for the elections when they come home for Diwali.

Raunak Kukde," Vishal Kumar & Purnedu Pritam  Anubhav Mishra As the Madhya Pradesh polls draw closer, the election campaign is intensifying in the state. The Congress, at least right now, seems to be campaigning more actively than the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). However, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, the BJP in-charge for the state feels that rather than to be seen campaigning on the road, it is more important that the public acknowledges the development that the state government has done. Speaking exclusively to  , Sahasrabuddhe claimed that the BJP will definitely win the Madhya Pradesh polls, but refused to mention the number of seats that their candidates would win. Is the BJP lagging behind in campaigning? We take each election as a challenge and contest it honestly. We don’t believe in spending a few days in a foreign country and then coming back for a couple of days to do politics. We take politics very seriously. Also, it’s not important that you see the campaigning on the road. Nowadays you can contest elections even on the internet. We have worked keeping in mind the politics of development. All that is left is for people to acknowledge it. Why does the BJP always mention 2003 when questioned about work done in 15 years? If someone says that the BJP was lucky to be elected to power thrice then I find it laughable. In 2003, we promised that we will deliver on basic needs like electricity, water and roads. We delivered on it. In 2008, we promised that we will remove MP from the list of BIMARU states. We delivered on that too. After 2013, we focused primarily on agriculture. Apart from Gujarat, which other state has connected their rivers? Because we connected Shipra and Narmada, the ground water level has improved in the region. This has facilitated irrigation in the area. Will the anti-incumbency factor against the BJP help the Congress? The Congress is running an ad that says “We are angry.” But the real reason for their anger is that for 15 years people kept them out of power. There hearts are filled with anger and despair. Public is not at all angry. The Congress is angry because voters rejected them for 15 years. Do you think the Congress lacks the strategy to counter the BJP? A strategy can be formed only when you have a designated leadership. They (the Congress) have given leadership to businessmen and royals. In every district or region they have a different chief ministerial candidate. In such a scenario, they don’t have a leadership, they don’t have any policy and I don’t even want to comment on their intentions. How many seats will the BJP win? We are going to win this election. I don’t want to get into the arithmetic of it unless all the candidates are declared. It would be better if the state leaders answer this question. I am merely an in-charge. Will the rebel leaders have an impact on the BJP’s performance? I don’t use the word ‘rebel.’ All of them are our brothers and sisters. Politics is a game aspirations, so obviously some of them were angry. So, if someone thought they deserved a ticket and filed nomination in protest of the party’s decision then we don’t consider them a ‘rebel.’ They are still our party workers. Most of them have already withdrawn their nominations. The rest of them will do the same. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

If they do something now, then too we will win.” Shah’s assertion is a part of the polarising politics that’s dominated the desert state in recent years. The composite culture nurtured for centuries by saints like Moinuddin Chishti, Meerabai and Ramdev Peer is increasingly ignored. Instead, politics in Rajasthan now revolves around the holy cow and pardoning self-styled  who execute cow-related lynchings. Instead of ensuring justice for victims, Rajasthan’s Home Minister and the Alwar Police seemed more keen to dub Pehlu and his sons as cow smugglers; a charge also leveled on Rakbar Khan who died in police custody in July. Ironically, while the alleged killers have gone scot free, Pehlu’s sons are petitioning courts for anticipatory bail. Many say the police partisanship aims to protect influential people affiliated to Hindutva groups. Perhaps the most gruesome was in Rajsamand district last December when a Hindu fanatic Shambhu Lal Regar not only hacked and burnt a Muslim labourer from West Bengal but also videotaped the gory act for social media. He tried to justify his act by calling it a case of ‘love jihaad’, a charge often levelled by right-wing Hindutva groups. In reality, the police charge sheet says Shambhu had an illicit relationship with the woman he referred to as the “Hindu sister” in his video and he raised the “love-jihad” bogey only to cover up his jealousy-driven murder. Appallingly, Hindutva groups supporting Shambhu, soon unfurled a saffron flag at the district court in Udaipur, and even attacked the police there. Some fanatics even honoured Shambhu with a tableau at the Ram Navami celebrations in Jodhpur this year, and on social media platforms, they even hailed Shambhu as a ‘hero who curbed love jihad’. Recently, a political outfit has announced that it will make Shambhu their candidate for next year’s Lok Sabha elections. The Vasundhara Raje government took no serious action even then. The British may have evolved the “divide and rule” policy but our parties have now perfected it into a political art. Rajasthan Education Minister, Vasudev Devnani has often belittled Akbar as just a ‘foreign invader’ and says the honorific of ‘great’ is suitable only for Rana Pratap. The minister even wants to drop any mention of Isaac Newton and Pythagoras theorem from state textbooks to make way for home-grown ‘heroes’ like Veer Savarkar. Incidentally, Devnani even  claims that the cow is the only animal which inhales and exhales oxygen. By asserting their Hindu identity, Congress leaders hope to rub off the ‘anti-Hindu’ taint the BJP has given them, and lure back their original Hindu voters who shifted to the BJP. In this ‘Hindu-friendly’ avatar, Congress leaders have shied away from visiting even Sufi shrines. What impact this new image will have is, of course, an open, tantalizing question. Given this backdrop, it’s no surprise that Prime Minister Modi did not even mention Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at the closing ceremony of Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ in Ajmer. Whether the Sufi saint, an enduring symbol of India’s composite culture, was ignored as an inadvertent slip or as a covert signal to please Hindutva hardliners is unclear. Like much of India, Rajasthan now seems more divided than ever, since Partition. The poison of polarisation may help parties win electoral battles but as citizens, we must ensure that they do not rob us of our humanity. Every new call of hatred, creates fresh fissures in society that may take centuries to heal.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The News Minute,"Telangana caretaker Chief Minister and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) President K Chandrashekhar Rao, who filed his nomination from Gajwel Assembly constituency on Wednesday, has declared his total assets worth over Rs 20.60 crore, but stated that neither he nor his wife owns any vehicle, despite being known for travelling with a massive convoy of swanky cars in the city and the state. His total movable assets are valued at over Rs 10.40 crore while his wife K Shobha has movable assets of over Rs 94.5 lakh. The TRS chief, in the affidavit filed before the returning officer, has shown agriculture as his profession. He pegged his income for financial year 2017-18 at Rs 2.07 crore including agricultural income of Rs 91.52 lakh. KCR declared that he has investments of Rs 4.71 crore in shares of Telangana Broadcasting Private Limited. He has Rs 5.63 crore in bank accounts and fixed deposits. KCR owns 75 grams of jewellery worth Rs 2.40 lakh and has Rs 2.40 lakh cash in hand while Shobha, a housewife, has 2,200 grams of gold jewellery, diamonds and valuables gems/stone worth Rs 93,66,184 and Rs. 93,595 cash in hand. According to the affidavit, KCR has liabilities to the tune of Rs 8.88 crore in the form of unsecured loans. He has no bank loans but declared that he owes his son and caretaker state IT Minister KT Rama Rao Rs 82.82 lakh, money which was   spent on a shed at one of KCR’s homes. KCR also provided details of 64 cases booked against him during Telangana agitation. No summons were issued and no charges were framed in any of these cases. Before filing his nomination, Rao offered prayers at Lord Venkateshwara temple at Konaipally village, a practice he has been following for over three decades. KCR has not lost any elections since 1985. He tasted defeat only in 1983, which was his first election. Accompanied by caretaker Irrigation Minister and his nephew T. Harish Rao and other TRS leaders, KCR offered prayers at the temple and placed his nomination papers at the feet of the deity. According to Harish’s affidavit, the total assets that he owns is worth around Rs 3.90 crore. However,   that there was a massive growth in his investments in property; land and jewellery, which grew from Rs 45 lakh in 2014 to Rs 3.46 crore as per his latest affidavit. KCR dissolved the Assembly on 6 September, nine months before its term was to end, and decided to go in for early polls, blaming the 'baseless' allegations by the Opposition parties for his move.

Taha Siddiqui,"On Saturday, 10 November 2018, I woke up to an email in my inbox from Twitter Legal giving me a warning about my social media account. The email said: I was immediately taken aback not knowing what was going on, or who was it that had corresponded to Twitter about my tweets. Twitter had not even informed me of the content that they were talking about but then I started inquiring around and found out that another fellow journalist Gul Bukhari had received a similar email from Twitter. However, most of these colleagues of mine decided to silently delete the tweets that were flagged, as they feared their accounts being muted in Pakistan, or worse suspended altogether. But since they live in the country still, their fear for further crackdown is not unfounded and understandable. In recent past, Pakistani authorities have been detaining, arresting and even kidnapping those vocal about state abuse on social media. I, on the other hand, decided to challenge Twitter, given my exile abroad. So, I wrote back to the platform and explained my position. Firstly, I explained to Twitter how I do not live in the country any longer so Pakistani laws do not apply to me (even my Twitter location tag says I am in France). I then went on to explain how Pakistani laws can be problematic when it comes to international standards. And many of them are in direct violation of international values. I also pointed out laws that have come into effect recently, that infringe upon the rights of people – for example the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) has already been widely used by the Pakistani government to quash dissent. I waited for Twitter to respond, but it has not until now. And therefore, it seems like Twitter is only interested in intimidating me on behalf of a repressive regime like the one in Pakistan, that is controlled by the Pakistan Army from the shadows. Why is Twitter doing this? The most obvious and simple answer is: business interests. In a recent story  , the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had informed the country’s Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat that while Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms had complied with requests from the government to block objectionable content, Twitter was not obliging. And voila, in less than three months, Twitter seems to have given in, like the other social media platforms that are already heavily censored in Pakistan. Facebook regularly removes pages and posts critical of the Pakistani state and its policies, especially the Pakistani army, and YouTube has introduced a local version for Pakistan (after it was blocked for almost three years). And therefore, it is safe to say that today these social media giants have become collaborators of repressive regimes like the one in my country. In the past, these websites were blocked by the Pakistani regulators under the pretext of blasphemy laws, but it seems that the current government is not even looking for such an excuse. And has just communicated point blank about shutting down the website, if it fails to abide by the country's requests. Renowned international publications have reached out to me to do a story about this issue. So, in effect, the results that the government of Pakistan wanted to achieve with the help of Twitter to silence me and other dissenters have only exposed them more and made our voice louder. I hope they have learnt a lesson.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Kritika Goel,"Purnendu Pritam The contest in Madhya Pradesh (MP) has fairly been binary with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holding the top office for 15 years, of which Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been the chief minister for 13 years. So, will this time the BJP secure MP for a fourth term or will the Congress add the state to its tally ahead of the 2019 polls? One of the biggest hurdles for the BJP now is, anti-incumbency. In 2013, the BJP got 44.88 percent of the vote share ahead of the Congress by 8.5 percent who got 36.38 percent of the vote share. But the recent opinion polls suggest a strong anti-incumbency factor. In fact, the CSDS and C-Voter polls have also predicted a tough fight between the BJP and Congress. However, there are other factors that the BJP needs to worry about. Congress has entered into an arrangement with a tribal outfit called JAYS which has made inroads in the state's tribal areas in recent months. JAYS going with the Congress could mean that the tribal vote may go as a block to the Congress. Adivasis make up 23 percent of Madhya Pradesh’s voter population. However, BSP is likely to split the oppressed caste vote bank because they have refused to enter into a pre-poll alliance with the Congress. In 2013, the BSP had a small but significant 6.29 percent vote share. Most likely, if the BJP wins, Shivraj Singh Chouhan stays on as the chief minister. And for the Congress, the front-runners would be Kamal Nath, who is leading the party’s campaign in the state or Jyotiraditya Scindia. However, who will form the government in the state will be known on 11 December. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"In a setback to Rajasthan's ruling BJP ahead of next month's elections, the party's Dausa MP Harish Chandra Meena joined the Congress on Wednesday, 14 November. Meena joined the Congress in the presence of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot and AICC's state in-charge Avinash Pande. ""I am happy that Harish Meena has decided to join the Congress in such times. I welcome him in the Congress fold,"" Gehlot said. Meanwhile, Pilot and Gehlot said they will contest the 7 December polls along with other senior leaders of the state. ""We are all united. It is BJP's conspiracy to spread false news that the Congress is divided,"" Gehlot said. Pilot said Meena belongs to a family of Congress members and had joined the party without any conditions. Before entering politics, Harish Chandra Meena was the longest-serving director general of police (DGP) of Rajasthan from 2009 to 2013. Meena had served as DGP when Ashok Gehlot was the chief minister of the state. Notably, in 2014, Harish Meena defeated his elder brother and senior Congress leader Namonarain Meena from the Dausa Lok Sabha seat. Namonarain Meena came third in the electoral contest. Harish Meena defeated his nearest rival Kirori Lal Meena, who was then a candidate of National People's Party and is now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP, by a margin of 45,404 votes. Apart from Namonarain, Harish Meena has another brother OP Meena who had reportedly served as Rajasthan chief secretary. Kirori Lal Meena said Harish Meena's joining the Congress will have no impact on tribal votes in Dausa and its nearby regions, reported PTI. There will be no impact. People know who is an opportunist and an opportunist can go anywhere, Kirori Lal Meena said. The exit of Harish Meena comes days before the state assembly elections in Rajasthan, scheduled for 7 December, and is likely to weaken the BJP in the state. Before Meena, Rajasthan BJP MLA Manvendra Singh, the son of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh, had joined the Congress in October. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Yashwant Deshmukh,"Election season is upon us, and five states are going to polls. In the assembly election fray are Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram. Chhattisgarh, in its first phase of assembly elections on Monday, 12 November, saw a 76.28 percent voter turnout, covering 18 assembly segments, despite Maoist threats of violence. Here is a quick look, using data from the latest C Voter Survey, at the popularity of leaders across contesting parties, vote-share and seat-share projections, in these five states. The survey reveals that the Congress will benefit, riding on its emerging young leadership, with the likes of Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan. Rajasthan is the easiest state to call in, in the Hindi heartland states slated for polls. It is ‘advantage Congress’ here. Its party chief Sachin Pilot enjoys a clear advantage in approval ratings as compared to the BJP’s incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. The Congress’s vote share lead over BJP is more than the statistical margin of error, thereby reducing the likelihood of an ‘against the run of play’ verdict. From a trail of 14 percent vote share in August, it is now down to 8 percent. However, the sheer size of the Congress’s lead in the state has ensured that a change of 2 percent vote share will not impact the seat share projections much. With the matter of ticket distribution settled and last-minute micro-management in place, the vote share trends may not differ substantially, here on. An 8 percent projected vote share lead is unlikely to be whittled down by a disjointed Rajasthan BJP. The Congress is leading all 5 electoral regions of Rajasthan comfortably, that is, with more than 3 percent projected vote share difference. Only in Marwad and Mewar regions, the Congress’s lead is less than 5 percent in vote share; in the other three regions, the Congress is completely dominating the BJP, especially in Dhundhar and Harouti. This is indicative of a uniform anti-incumbency mood across the state with no pocket of BJP influence shining through in the polls. The Congress’s Sachin Pilot is the most popular CM candidate in the state, followed by the incumbent CM Vasundhara Raje of BJP, Ashok Gehlot of Congress, and a former CM is a close third. With Sachin Pilot cornering 38.7 percent votes and Ashok Gehlot tallying 20.5 percent votes, a lot rides on the status of infighting. Therefore, when asked to specifically choose between Pilot or Raje, we observe that Pilot can garner support from loyalists of other leaders. Thus, in leadership sweepstakes, Rajasthan Congress seems to be managing its house well. A tough one to predict. Despite a 3-term anti-incumbency and insipid state BJP, the Congress is unable to decisively tilt the scales in it favour. Jyotiraditya Scindia of the Congress is the most popular CM candidate here, closely followed by Shivraj Singh Chouhan of the BJP. Infighting in INC, popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and incumbent CM Chouhan’s pockets of influence are sustaining BJP in the fray. Despite all these factors, Congress has a slight edge, albeit within the statistical margin of error. The race to Bhopal has become tighter. Owing to triple anti-incumbency and a part- rejuvenated MP Congress, we must give the benefit of doubt to the Congress. A close contest brings micro and regional factors into play. Therefore in Madhya Pradesh, a sweep in one of the regions by either party can upset the balance. The regional equation and the relative strength of the two parties in various regions may decide the election. The Congress and BJP are decisively leading two regions each, while the BJP is narrowly leading 2 more regions. These regions being Mahakaushal and Nimar; any late swing in these two regions may be the difference between treasury and opposition benches. This election is now a sum total of regional elections, and both the parties should now focus on winning the same. Congress has the most popular leader in the state, and incumbent CM Chouhan is a close second. In a runoff style question, the gap between Scindia and Chouhan increases; this indicates that the faction-fighting in the Congress may not impact its fortunes to the extent suspected earlier. The vote share difference between Congress has narrowed down to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent between August 2018 to November 2018. To put it in perspective, the 2013 Vidhan Sabha results were decided by 0.7 percent vote share between the BJP and the INC. For a state known for close verdicts, we are getting an all-time close polling data in the surveys. The reason for the same is vote-splitting by Ajit Jogi who continues to command a loyal band of followers who are ditching the INC for him. Thus, even in this case, the INC is unable to capitalise on triple-term anti-incumbency. The INC started with a slight advantage over the BJP in August. However, that advantage is now reduced to a sliver. (PM Modi was yet to campaign when the survey responses were collected). Therefore, it is safe to say that BJP may tilt the scales ever so slightly in its favour to squeeze a narrow win, given the moribund leadership of the state Congress, and Ajit Jogi’s vote-splitting cameo with Mayawati’s BSP. The INC and BJP are locked bumper to bumper in all 3 regions of the state including the most critical central region. A slight move in either of the regions may precipitate a landslide for either party. Given the ground situation, it seems that BJP might be the first mover here. BJP’s Raman Singh, the incumbent CM, continues to be most popular leader in the state. The leadership vacuum is hurting the Congress big time in Chhattisgarh, an announcement of a CM face may have given it some wind in the sails but currently Congress is a nameless and leaderless party. Despite its disjointed campaign, the INC is giving a close fight, but may lose out due to the Modi dividend, leadership vacuum and CM Raman Singh’s popularity. The INC-TDP alliance has changed the electoral landscape of the Telangana. The KCR-led TRS was expected to comfortably win the election, however, the TDP and INC bonhomie has upset those plans. The INC-TDP alliance leads the polls by 4.5 percent vote share. This lead may get strengthened owing to the bandwagon effect that causes voters to switch to a side that is winning. KCR is the most popular leader in the ‘standalone and runoff style’ polling. However, the electoral arithmetic of TDP and INC is besting his party. Perhaps this is also a critical weakness of TRS; standalone, it is unable to take on TDP and INC.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Arun Dev,"What next after HN Ananth Kumar’s death? This was a question ignored by the leaders of the BJP and the Opposition, who were grieving the death of a politician respected across the party lines. But after he was laid to rest on Tuesday, the political parties are finally getting around to address the elephant in the room. Ananth Kumar was a six-time parliamentarian from Bengaluru south, a seat the Opposition couldn’t win even after fielding famous entrepreneur Nandan Nilekani in 2014. For the Karnataka BJP, Ananth Kumar was an effective link between the party’s central and state unit, and most importantly, he had enormous influence and was a lobbyist for Karnataka’s interest in New Delhi – a job for which he went beyond party lines. So, there are three big questions for which the parties will be looking for answers in the coming days. Will fortunes change in Bengaluru south constituency? Who will step into Ananth Kumar’s role as the buffer between New Delhi and Bengaluru, for the BJP? And who will champion Karnataka’s cause at the nation’s capital? In 1996, when the BJP decided not to give their sitting MP Venkatagiri Gowda a ticket, many eyebrows were raised. Later, when Ananth Kumar, a debutant, was given the job on winning the seat, many within the party were skeptical. But the rest as they say was history. After his death, at the BJP headquarters in Malleshwaram, Ananth Kumar’s wife Tejashwini has been projected as his obvious replacement. Tejashwini, who has wide public reach through her non-profit organisation Adamya Chetana, which provided mid-day meals, however never showed any interest in politics in the past. For the Congress- JD(S) coalition, Ananth Kumar’s death provides an opportunity. Bengaluru South has a large Brahmin base and Ananth Kumar, a Brahmin, enjoyed the support of this voter base. The Congress, which had recently elevated Dinesh Gundurao, a Brahmin, as their party state president, will be looking to field a Brahmin candidate in the upcoming elections. However, another camp within the Congress believe that the coalition with the JD(S) provides an opportunity to break the Brahmin dominance in the region. As the JD(S) enjoys the support of the Vokkaliga community and the minorities in the constituency had historically supported the Congress party, the coalition stands a chance to win the seat combining these two vote banks, he argued. While BS Yeddyurappa handled the state affairs for the BJP, Ananth Kumar was the face for the party in New Delhi. Ananth Kumar who had a good rapport with New Delhi, was a crucial link between the party’s central leadership and state unit. Anant Kumar Hegde, the BJP parliamentarian from coastal Karnataka is touted as a potential candidate for the filling this vacant role. Over the past few years, Anant Kumar has been gaining popularity in both Karnataka and New Delhi. Despite his strong communal views, he was a surprise choice as the minister for state in the Modi government. However, there are other senior leaders like DV Sadananda Gowda and Shobha Karandlaje, who are contenders for a national role as well. Anant Kumar Hegde’s rising popularity, however, may work against these two. When matters of Karnataka’s interest were at stake, the leaders of the state have worked together in the past, going beyond party politics, may it be the Cauvery water dispute or the getting the government funds for development. Even for the Congress and JD(S) chief minister, Ananth Kumar was an ally in the New Delhi for matters concerning Karnataka. His good rapport with leaders from all parties, made the task even easier. The question of who will fill those shoes is a tough one, say leaders. There have not been many senior leaders from Karnataka, who have close contacts with the government at the Centre and good relations across parties. According to observers, the citizens will have to wait and watch for the rise of regional leader from Karnataka to take on the task which has no strong contenders vying for it at present.

In Chhattisgarh, paddy is grown in abundance, but the farmlands are still bare. Ram Kumar Sahu, a farmer, says no crop has been harvested in the 11 acres of land that belongs to him in Maro village for the last 4 years. He says: Ram Kumar Sahu is not the only farmer who is disappointed with the BJP-led state government. Erratic monsoon showers in the state have led to irregular water supply. A report by the   said that 96 tehsils of the state’s 21 districts were drought-affected in September 2017. Farmers say that they have appealed to the state government to build a canal but their demands have been ignored.

Ahuja, who represents Ramgarh in Alwar district in the current Assembly, had   said in 2016 that JNU students take drugs and “perform obscene dances”. Not just this, Ahuja had also courted controversy in the Rakbar Khan lynching case, when he said that  would challenge the chargesheet in the court as “it does not say a word” about “cow smugglers” and the policemen charged with dereliction of duty. “The chargesheet is injustice to those innocents who have been held accused for their only mistake was that they alerted the police and got the cow smugglers arrested”, Ahuja had said. The MLA had also   labelled the accused in the Pehlu Khan lynching case as “innocent”. In August this year, he also said, that Nehru was not a ‘Pandit’ since he “ate beef and pork”. With the release of the second list, the BJP has so far announced the names of 162 candidates in the 200-member assembly. Outgoing ministers Babulal Verma, Rajkumar Rinwa and Dhan Singh Rabat were denied party ticket this election. Assembly election in Rajasthan will be held on 7 December. The BJP is facing a strong challenge from a resurgent Congress in the state with the opposition party winning a number of bypolls in the past couple of years. A number of opinion polls has also given an edge to the Congress but the BJP has insisted that it will be able to repulse the Opposition's challenge. The saffron party under Vasundhara Raje had won 163 of the 200 assembly seats in the state in 2013, giving the Congress its worst-ever drubbing.

The Quint," Shiv Kumar Maurya Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday, 12 November, said at an event in Delhi, that it's because of Nehru's institutional structures that even a   could aspire to, and eventually become the prime minister of the country. Tharoor was speaking, on the eve of Nehru’s 129th birth anniversary, at the re-launch of his 2003 book –  . UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi delivered the inaugural address, in which she invoked the values of Nehru, spoke of his legacy and the ‘efforts by the ruling BJP government’ to undermine that legacy. Praising Nehru's institutional values, Tharoor said that Nehru believed in democracy despite it being the toughest choice, given the state of the country after Partition. “It would have been easy to say, ‘We need a firm hand, democracy is not an option.’ But Nehru never considered this an option,” Tharoor stated. Tharoor also said that Nehru was always open to criticism, whether it came from the Opposition or his own party. “Shankar, a famous cartoonist back then, used to regularly poke fun at Nehru... Nehru took it all,” Tharoor added. Commenting on Nehru’s views on religion, Tharoor said that while Nehru didn’t care for religion, he also didn’t speak one unsavoury word against a religious group or community. “He was also not particularly religious. We have to accept the fact that the well springs of Nehruvian secularism did lie in agnosticism,” he said. “It was not that he disrespected religion, but he had no time for the professed leaders. In one of the letters that I quoted, he said he has no patience for mullahs and maulavis or sadhus and sants and that they don’t have answers to all the problems of the nation. That is an interesting thing because while that was very much his personal proclivity, he never imposed that on a nation which is very deeply steeped in religion,” Tharoor said. BJP Hits Back In a rather sarcastic tweet, the BJP on Wednesday, 12 November said that Nehru was the sole reason humanity exists. “Minor correction Dr. Tharoor, Nehru is the sole reason why humanity exists. Don’t trivialise his role to mundane matters like making Prime Ministers and all that ,” the tweet read. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the Congress cannot look beyond one family or recall the contribution of others to the country. Javadekar said the Congress talked only about one family and never mentioned the likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The opposition party wanted to restrict historical references to one family, he added. Modi was such a ""magnanimous"" prime minister that he had mentioned umpteen number of times that all prime ministers had contributed to the country while the Congress never mentioned the name of P V Narasimha Rao, Javadekar said.

The Quint,"Deviating from its stand against dynastic politics, the ruling BJP has awarded tickets to close family members of several party leaders to contest the 7 December Assembly election in Rajasthan. Party leaders said the deviation was necessitated to avoid revolt within the party, reported PTI. In the BJP's first list of 131 candidates released on Sunday, 11 November, the party has given ticket to its 85 sitting MLAs and has taken care of the family members of prominent leaders who were denied ticket. Union Minister JP Nadda said that in the list of 131 candidates, there are 12 female candidates, 32 young candidates, 17 from the SC category, 19 from the ST category, and 25 new faces. However, as various   have pointed out, there are no Muslim candidates in the first list. Notably, in the last assembly election of 2013, four Muslim candidates had represented the BJP in Rajasthan, with two of them emerging victorious. The first list comprises sons, grandsons and daughter-in-laws of several prominent leaders of the BJP. The saffron party has also given due attention to family members of deceased leaders. The BJP has given ticket to Ram Swaroop Lamba, the son of late MP Sanwar Lal Jat, to contest election from Nasirabad seat and to Shailesh Singh, the son of late former state minister Digamber Singh, from Deeg-Kumher seat. The party has once again reposed faith in Lamba, who was fielded to contest the Lok Sabha bypoll from Ajmer seat earlier this year. He had lost the election to Congress's Raghu Sharma by 80,000 votes. From Kolayat Assembly seat in Bikaner district, the party has given ticket to senior leader Devi Singh Bhati's daughter-in-law Poonam Kanwar. It has fielded Rishi Bansal's wife Ritu from Bayana seat in Bharatpur district, reported PTI. The other names include former minister Nandlal Meena's son Hemant Meena from Pratapgarh, former legislator Gurjant Singh's grandson Gurveer Singh Brar, former legislator Kailash Bhansali's nephew Atul Bhansali from Jodhpur and former legislator Kunjilal's son Rajendra Meena from Bamanwas. Among the three Muslim leaders denied tickets in the first list, two of them were defeated in 2013 Assembly polls,  . They are Sagir Ahmed from Dholpur and Salim Tanwar from Mandawa. The third Muslim leader who has been denied a ticket is Habibur Rahman, the current MLA from Nagaur. Rahman resigned from the party on Tuesday, saying that he took the decision as there is “discontent among my supporters against the party’s decision to drop my name this time”. The lack of any Muslim candidates in the first list has also prompted the minority cell of the Rajasthan BJP to write a letter to PM Modi, Amit Shah and Vasundhara Raje, reported  . However, in the second list, one Muslim candidate is likely to figure, namely Yoonus Khan, who is regarded as a “close confidante” of CM Vasundhara Raje. Khan is an MLA from Didwana.

PTI,"Demonetisation was the ""biggest scam in independent India"" due to which many citizens lost their lives, jobs and life-long savings, senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged on Tuesday, 13 November. He hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for defending note ban on its second anniversary at a rally in poll-bound Chhattisgarh and reiterated that there was a scam in the Rafale deal. Singling out Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi, Modi, had on Monday said in Chhattisgarh that the ""mother-son duo were out on bail"" and hit out at them for questioning the government's demonetisation move. Without naming the Gandhis, he said ""they should not forget"" that it was due to the note ban move that they ""had to seek bail"". On 8 November 2016, Modi had announced a ban on then in use Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denomination bank notes with immediate effect. Addressing a press conference, Surjewala claimed that around 120 people died waiting in bank queues for their money, while many lost their jobs and women had to forgo their life-long savings following note ban. ""On the second anniversary of note bandi, the prime minster finally broke his silence in Chhattisgarh on Monday. Instead of taking responsibility for the demonetisation scam, he was levelling charges against the opposition,"" he said. Modi was appreciating note ban despite it snatching away the hard earned money of farmers, poor, labourers, middle class and shopkeepers, he said. Surjewala claimed that demonetisation benefited those who had black money as they deposited it in the banks. ""Overnight, all the black money became white,"" the All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson said. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on the second anniversary of note ban on 8 November said that it had resulted in formalisation of economy and increased tax base, prompting the government to earmark more resources for the poor and infrastructure development. Surjewala further slammed the Centre over the alleged Rafale scam and said, ""Nation doesn't need doctored explanations but fair investigation."" ""(The) fixed match between the BJP government and Dassault and the PR stunts of PM Modi and (French firm Dassault Aviation's CEO) Eric Trappier can't hide the blatant corruption,"" he alleged. The government has denied allegations of corruption in the deal. Attacking Modi, Surjewala called him a protector of ""ghotalebaaz"" (corrupt) and ""chowkidar"" (watchman) of looters. The prime minister is frustrated as he is staring at defeat in the ongoing and upcoming elections in the five states as well as the Lok Sabha polls due next year, he claimed. ""Modi is unnerved by the lack of response to his empty rhetoric and 'jumlas' which stand rejected by people of India. He is worried about losing power and facing investigation on charges of corruption and an impossible bail that he may have to seek,"" he charged. Surjewala said Modi can control Parliament on the strength of his party's majority but he can neither suppress the voice of Rahul Gandhi nor of the people. ""People will give him a befitting reply in the elections underway in five states and in the next year's Lok Sabha polls,"" he said. Terming the allegations as ""baseless"", BJP's state general secretary Santosh Pandey said the Congress was trying to gain attention by spreading rumours and was in fact afraid of Modi. ""Surjewala and the Congress don't have any issues to counter the development work done by the Raman Singh government in the state,"" he said. ""Out of frustration, the Congress is trying to contest the election through rumours. These allegations are baseless and have no facts. The Congress cannot attain success by spreading rumours,"" he told PTI. He claimed said people of the country did not trust the Congress anymore and that the opposition party's leaders were worried about protecting their existence in Chhattisgarh as well as in the country. The BJP leader appreciated the note ban decision, claiming that it had ""exposed fake NGOs in which Rahul Gandhi's people were partners."" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

To make the situation even more challenging, the Congress refused to give Chouhan a walkover in his constituency of Budhni and nominated Arun Yadav, a senior Congress leader, from the seat. But Chouhan seems unfazed and instead of taking Yadav head on, his son Kartikeya Chouhan seems to be leading the charge in Budhni. Speaking exclusively to  , Kartikeya laid down his campaign strategy, called out Rahul Gandhi for accusing him of ‘Panama Gate’ and claimed that the BJP would win over 200 seats in the state. How big of a challenge is Arun Yadav? The campaign is being driven by all the party workers and one of those workers is Kartikeya Chouhan. Arun Yadav is a senior Congress leader. I and all the members of the BJP respect him. Now that he has come to Budhni, we welcome him but we will contest this election with all seriousness. What is BJP’s campaign strategy?

I will try to deliver on those expectations. How would you respond to Rahul Gandhi’s allegations against you over Panama papers? We respect the national president of the Congress because he is the national president of a party.

The RSS and all of us belong to a nationalist ideology. Such points in a manifesto, according to me, are an attempt to malign the image of nationalism. RSS leaders and members have devoted their lives to the nation. And all the parties should at least have some respect for them. We oppose this point in their manifesto. It will definitely hurt them.

They express disdain and contempt for Nehru, for all that he did to build India, that they are bent upon changing for the worse. Today, we must honour Nehru by fighting with determination to safeguard our democracy against those who are undermining it,” she said. Gandhi was speaking at the relaunch of a 2003 book,  , written by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. The book is being relaunched ahead of Nehru’s birth anniversary on Wednesday, 14 November. “Democratic institution building, socialist economics, foreign policy of non-alignment – these values, integral to Indianness, is fundamentally being challenged today, but remains at the core of our beliefs,” she said. Speaking of secularism, the UPA chairperson said that after the Partition of India, Nehru never believed that India was a country only for Hindu Indians. ""Nehru never accepted the logic that since Pakistan had been created for Indian Muslims, what remained was a state for Hindus. He lived up to his life-long conviction, that India belonged to all its people and that the majority community had an obligation to protect the rights and to promote India’s minorities.

Tharoor also said that Nehru was always open to criticism, whether it came from the Opposition or his own party. “Nehru gave importance to the Opposition. Nehru made sure the Opposition felt free to criticise him and he took that criticism seriously. Nehru also encouraged his own party members to speak out against him. The most famous such example being Feroze Gandhi taking him on, issue after issue,” Tharoor said. “In the lead up to the 1962 war, Nehru made a comment about ‘not a blade of grass grows there,’ pointing to Aksai Chin. And someone retaliated, saying, ‘Nehru   not a blade of hair grows on your head; will you also give your head away?’” – Nehru took this with a smile, and resignation. “Shankar, a famous cartoonist back then, used to regularly poke fun at Nehru.

But now, not only have Russia and Iran developed ties with them, but even American officials have held direct talks with the Islamist group in recent months. This marks the return of Russia to the ‘Great Game’, and is yet another indicator of its determination to play a larger regional role. Present at the meeting were representatives of 11 countries including China and Pakistan. The Taliban delegation was led by the Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai and Abdul Salam Hanafi (who run the Taliban’s political office in Doha, Qatar). The Afghan government sent a delegation comprising four members of its High Peace Council, whose task is to promote national reconciliation. The Moscow Format, is a Russian-led effort to promote peace, and featured officials and unofficial representatives of Afghanistan, US, India, Iran, Pakistan, China, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the Taliban.  its aim is to establish a wide inter-Afghan dialogue aimed at promoting national reconciliation, and defeating the threat of the Islamic State group to the countries of the region. The Americans sent an official from its Moscow embassy as an observer, and the Indians added their own creative bit by sending two retired foreign service officers who are associated with government-funded think tanks, to participate in the dialogue. They are T C A Raghavan, former High Commissioner to Islamabad and currently head of the Indian Council for World Affairs, and Amar Sinha, former Ambassador to Kabul and Distinguished Fellow at the Research and Information Systems for Developing Countries. The first meeting hosted by Moscow collapsed in September when the Afghan government refused to meet Taliban representatives. At the time, an Indian official had been sent to attend the meeting. The Indian position has varied from the official one which says that any peace talks in the country must be “Afghan-owned” and “Afghan-led”, by which it means the Government of Afghanistan.  In line with this, it supported the Kabul Process initiated by Ghani in 2017. India was also signatory to the Tashkent Declaration of March 2018 which endorsed an Afghan-led process. The   was held between the new US Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban representatives again in Qatar last month. The Taliban want the Americans to leave before the formal peace process begins, while Washington is seeking to persuade the Taliban to talk directly to the Afghan government, even while it maintains a military force in the country. The American decision was motivated by the fact that the Trump strategy is not making any difference to the ground situation in the country and the Taliban   their control and retaining the momentum of violence. For years, India has resisted any direct dealings with the Taliban. There are memories of the manner in which they played the Indian officials, amongst them current NSA Ajit Doval, during the hijack of IC 814 to Kandahar, in December 1999. There is also a recollection of how territory under the control of the Taliban was used to house training camps for militants belonging to organisations active in Jammu & Kashmir. Needless to say, the Indian position has been coloured by the role of Pakistan in providing logistical support to the outfit and so, its victory is liable to be seen as a victory for Islamabad by New Delhi. Ideally, India would have liked the NATO and the US to fight the Taliban to the end.  But that is not going to happen. India was overjoyed when the Trump Administration made Afghanistan a focus of its South Asia policy in 2017 and brought Islamabad in its cross-hairs for continuing to support the Afghan Taliban. But after a brief estrangement, the US and Pakistan are once again doing business together. This was underscored   to remove the Lashkar-e-Tayyeba from provision in its National Defence Authorisation Act that would have required the government to “significantly disrupt” the activities of the LeT and the Haqqani network. It will try to (presumably) coordinate with the Afghan government, which it supports strongly. Simultaneously, the process enables India to build ties with the Taliban, even if somewhat late in the day. India cannot ignore the fact that ground realities ensure that the Taliban will be in the Afghan governing structure in some form or the other in the future.       .)

Neeraj Gupta,": Fabeha Syed : Mohd Irshad Alam Chhattisgarh is going to see its first three-sided contest which is a deviance from the usual face-off between the Congress and the BJP that the state has always seen. Former chief minister Ajit Jogi quit the Congress to create a new party, Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC). Months ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls, JCC entered into an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Communist Party of India (CPI). According to recent surveys, this alliance will affect the vote share of the Congress in the state. But the Leader of Opposition in Chhattisgarh Assembly election and prominent Congress face TS Singh Deo feels otherwise. In an exclusive interview with  , Singh Deo talks about Ajit Jogi and why the party won’t enter into an alliance with him. When he [Ajit Jogi] was the chief minister in 2003, he failed to win the majority vote for the Congress. Even as Jogi’s impact on the Congress has reduced, the position of the party has improved in tribal areas. It’s true that Jogi is known for his influence over scheduled caste, scheduled tribes and Satnami Samaj voters. Ajit Jogi is doing politics with a ‘Tribal Certificate’ but everyone knows that his father was a Satnami. What if Mayawati had tied up with the Congress? Mayawati would have benefited if she had formed an alliance with the Congress. Now when she makes an alliance elsewhere, she won’t harm either the BJP or the Congress. Jogi ji used to sabotage the Congress and help the BJP while he was still in the [Congress] party. Now his chances of destroying the party have reduced to less than 25 percent ever since he left the Congress. The votes he used to divert to the BJP will now be collected in his name. It has become quite evident that Amit Shah and Modi ji don’t refrain from spreading lies. He stands on the land where Mahendra Karma (Congress leader) was martyred and says that the Congress helps Naxals. What could be a greater evidence than the Jheeram valley attack that the BJP and Naxals are in fact complicit. More than 30 people were martyred. The top leadership of the Congress was eliminated. Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Vidya Charan Shukla. Amit Shah claims to have controlled the Naxal terror. But when Chhattisgarh was formed, the area had an army force of 5,000 including soldiers and policemen. Today there are almost 50,000 deployed. The Congress party will first try to win the confidence of youth, and we are very clear about that. The way young men have been arrested and thrown in prison for years. And then they are released, saying there is no evidence against them. This needs to stop. To improve its performance, the Congress has taken many important decisions and has implemented some new political tactics in Chhattisgarh. To ensure this, Congress has tried to bring the youth and women of Chhattisgarh together at the booth level. We have increased social media connectivity. We have launched a platform like ‘Shakti’ (a mobile app). We have given responsibilities at block levels. If everything goes as planned, we are likely to win all 90 seats. But this doesn’t happen in real life that’s why we are trying to work hard in areas where we lack strength. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Manoj Joshi,"It would be difficult to take issue with any of the themes that National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval took up in his Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture on Thursday, 25 October. The highly cerebral Doval, who has a reputation for operational efficiency, declared: Ironically, his speech came on the same day when the government made short work of the rule of law and its intelligence officers were caught, apparently while maintaining surveillance over the head of the CBI, who had been replaced in highly questionable circumstances the night before. In 2014, for the first time in 30 years, India did get a government that was not a coalition. Its leader had a reputation for decisiveness and his authority over the government and the BJP was untrammeled. As a bonus, crude oil prices, a critical factor for the Indian economy, had halved over the previous year and remained low till 2017. Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised a corruption-free government, a government that would be decisive and push for market-friendly reforms. The reality we have just witnessed is of a government that was paralysed as the number one and number two in its premier investigation agency accused each other of corruption. The government response has been dodgy, to say the least. As for a technologically advanced military, ready to fight fourth-generation contact-less wars, the record of the government is less than shoddy. The Modi government has seriously underfunded the armed forces. India’s defence budget is just 1.57 percent of the GDP, the lowest since the disastrous China war of 1962. But this is not the issue, what is more germane is the fact that all three Services have been seriously short-changed when it comes to capital outlays which are used to buy new equipment. In the case of the army, the allocation of Rs 21,338 crore was not even sufficient to meet the committed payments of Rs 29,033 crore for past contracts. It is this new equipment that will ready the military to fight the kind of wars that Doval was referring to, and as of now nothing is happening on that front except talk. As it is, there is a tendency to over-state Doval’s authority over the government. Though, it cannot be denied that he has gained unprecedented responsibilities in comparison to his predecessors, barring Brajesh Mishra, who was also Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister. As NSA, in any case, he supervises the intelligence agencies, is the points man for the China and Pakistan policy, and heads the executive council of the nuclear command authority. Earlier this year, the government, in its wisdom, decided to make him the chair of the Defence Planning Committee, a highly unusual arrangement that has sought to provide a measure of integration over India’s stove-piped and scattered defence management system. Doval has carried out significant changes in the National Security Council system that he heads and expanded its remit. The latter fact testified to by its hugely expanded budget and the National Security Council Secretariat’s take over of the entire Sardar Patel Bhavan in Parliament Street, where it had occupied some half the space till recently. Again, it would not be right to lay it all on Doval’s head. But in some instances, he must accept responsibility for substandard operations and ill-conceived strategies. Then, his hard-line strategy in Jammu & Kashmir is far from yielding a dividend and his policy has led to increased tensions. As for China, after a policy of irritating Beijing by promoting the exiled Tibetans and Uighurs, even while belabouring it for not backing India’s case in the NSG or in proscribing Masood Azhar, Doval’s boss, Prime Minister Modi, decided that discretion was the better part of valour and has smoked the peace pipe with Xi Jinping in Wuhan. Analysing Doval’s record is important for getting a measure of the importance of what he said in his lecture on Thursday. The government Doval has worked for, unfortunately, has not quite displayed an ability to execute policy effectively.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Prof M V Rajeev Gowda,"I am very upset to hear about the untimely demise of my friend, Union Minister Ananth Kumar. He was my neighbor and MP. He came into politics at a very young age as part of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. He gained prominence in the Hubli Idgah Maidan agitation in the 1990s. He was about 36-37 years old at the time. He went on to win in 1996 – and followed up with five more Lok Sabha victories, the last against Nandan Nilekani. In 1998, a very unexpected development occurred. Only 39-years-old and with just two years behind him in Parliament, Ananth Kumar was appointed a Cabinet minister by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee when formed his second government. Ananth Kumar was so young and relatively unknown, that this came as a surprise to all of us outside the Sangh Parivar. Later, Ananth Kumar explained, that his becoming a minister was due to Pramod Mahajan, who played an important role in persuading Vajpayee. This made a critical difference to the party that wanted to be a party with a difference. The ‘modern’ BJP owes a lot of its success to the foundations laid by Mahajan and Kumar. Ananth Kumar's own success owes a lot to two strong, capable women. His mother, Girija Sastry, was an activist and politician in Hubli who inspired her son to engage with public life. Throughout his political career, he also had the strong support of his wife Tejaswini, who ran the NGO, ‘Adamya Chetana’, that provided midday meals in schools and made a difference to the lives of the poor. Kumar went on to work for two decades in Parliament; he was union minister multiple times, and also served as BJP National General Secretary. He was involved in the privatisation efforts of the Vajpayee government, divesting several Ashoka Hotels to the private sector. Of course, he would have also loved to become Chief Minister of Karnataka. He was an affable man and had good friends across political parties, which made him a good choice for Parliamentary Affairs Minister. I used to always taunt him that I would contest against him and win. But, unfortunately, my party chose others for the ticket multiple times, never giving me a chance to back up my boast. Recently I hitched a ride home with him after an all party MPs meeting with the chief minister. He asked me whether I was getting ready to contest against him. I told him that I was happy in the Rajya Sabha now. He said he too was tired of fighting direct elections and would happily move to the Upper House. Unfortunately, cancer has taken him away to a very different Upper House. To think about someone just four years older than me, who had decades of political achievement ahead of him, to hear that he is no more with us, is a great shock. My sincere condolences to his family and to his supporters, who I hope will all bear the loss with strength. For my part, I look forward to taking to completion, a project that was dear to Ananth Kumar’s heart and mind – that is, suburban rail for Bengaluru. Ananth Kumar is the first to have raised this issue in Parliament, bringing in the concept of circular rail. I have been pushing for this too, since before my entry into Parliament. Railway Minister Piyush Goyal would do a great favour to Bengaluru’s citizens and to the memory of Ananth Kumar, if he could expedite the establishment of the suburban rail project, as a true tribute to the memory of this parliamentarian who has done a lot for Bengaluru and India.

Anthony Rozario,"In 2014, as posters of Narendra Modi’s prime ministerial campaign floated in the remotest corners of the country, one man in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur found himself at the centre of much fanfare. He wasn’t a big-ticket politico or a spokesperson, but just an ordinary man who looked eerily similar to the then Gujarat chief minister. From then to now, it’s been a tumultuous journey for PM Modi’s doppelgänger, Abhinandan Pathak. “Initially, it was all good,” Pathak says. People would chant ‘Modi Modi’ at his mere sight and even marvel at Pathak’s sharp resemblance to the prime minister. But a year into Modi’s tenure, Pathak’s views changed, and the fanfare diminished. Pathak recalls that the only time he met the Prime Minister, before Modi won the 2014 general elections, was memorable. He says that PM Modi was stunned on seeing him and stared at him for a few minutes. “He forgot to get out of the car. Eventually, as he did, I fell on his feet, much like Lakshman fell on his brother Ram’s. He then picked me up, and hugged me,” Pathak says. Ever since, Pathak has tried to reach out to the Prime Minister on several occasions, only to be disappointed. Once a big fan of Modi, Pathak now feels that the PM has failed to deliver on his promises. Referring to allegations of crony capitalism and corporate frauds, Pathak says, “PM Modi may not eat (be corrupt) himself, but he hasn’t stopped others from eating.” Disillusioned by the Prime Minister, Pathak recently quit the Republican Party of India – an ally of the BJP – and joined the Congress. He has been campaigning in poll-bound Chhattisgarh for the ‘grand old party’ and has even met Congress President Rahul Gandhi. But Pathak will only stay if the Congress provides him with a platform. Otherwise, “he will form his own party.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Pushpesh Pant,"Dear Fellow Residents of Delhi and NCR, Thank your stars for small mercies. This year the post-Diwali pollution is perceptibly less and the toxic stench of sulphur and phosphorus is less asphyxiating. Fewer deaths of senior citizens and children due to respiratory diseases have been reported, but hazards greater than paddy burning in Punjab continue to lurk in the shadows. There are some easily excitable and irresponsible compatriots of ours who have been shouting themselves hoarse subverting the rule of law, suggesting that the Supreme Court can go and take a walk, as bursting firecrackers to celebrate Diwali is a matter of “Hindu religious beliefs”. In this land of infinite and glorious variety, conceding this, amounts to demolishing the judicial system in one fell swoop. Any individual can invoke this plea to justify inhuman behaviour or patently criminal practices, repugnant to moral conscience and natural justice. Gone are the times when in a theocracy the Pope or the Caliph, Qazi or any other religious leader could claim sectarian monopoly to interpret the Holy Book for their flock, enforce divine commandments under threat of excommunication or worse. In a modern state, it is for the courts alone to adjudicate all disputes between individuals, groups or citizen and the government. Their jurisdiction includes contentious issues in different religions. What is the ‘core’ or essential practice of a religion can’t be established otherwise. Time to return to fireworks. Historians tell us that it was a couple of centuries before the birth of Christ that someone in China ‘invented’ firecrackers by overheating a dry bamboo that burst with a bang. It was a while before gunpowder contributed to a louder and more spectacular explosion. The Chinese are not a people to rest on their laurels, and continued in succeeding centuries to convert the firecrackers into fireworks. The addition of myriad chemicals, particles of metal and minerals blended with artistic imagination extended the horizons of pyrotechnics – literally translated as  (dis)play with fire. The West has grudgingly admitted that it was in China where fireworks first lit the sky and became a custom, if not part of the core practice of celebrations at the Imperial Court, and religious festivities in the temples. Foreign travellers like Verthama have chronicled their use in Vijayanagar Empire. Kautuk Chintamani, compiled by Gajapati Pratap Chandra Rudra Dev of Orissa around the same time, also describes pyrotechnics as expensive amusement, fit for rulers and the very rich. Gunpowder, an essential ingredient of fire crackers, was unknown in ancient India. All available evidence suggests that gunpowder and fireworks came to India with the Arabs and Mongols in the medieval period. The uber patriotic  may not like it, but if anyone can claim that fireworks are essential to their traditional festivities, it is the Chinese. True, there are other lands and people where elaborate fireworks displays are part of public celebration, but they all flatter the Chinese through imitation. The US Independence Day, Guy Fawkes’s Day, Halloween are the examples that readily come to mind, but none of these is remotely tinged with religious fervour. Display of fireworks and the accompanying nuisance, as marriage processions wind through roads choked by traffic, is enough to throw anyone into a furious non-religious frenzy. Fireworks industry in India is arguably one of the most ruthlessly exploitative industries where children are made to toil in inhuman and extremely hazardous conditions. Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu is infamous for child labour. There have been a number of gory accidental deaths but not much has changed. There is no dearth of self styled scholar-translators who can quote at will scriptures to ‘prove’ that Indians/Hindus have, since time immemorial used firecrackers to celebrate victory of good over evil, and to express joy. But myths, legend and lore have kicked history in the butt in contemporary India, and ‘ Flowers Showered from Heavens’ can easily be passed off as fiery starlets dropping earthwards – remains of extinguished sparklers! One is reminded of a line in one of Tagore’s poems where he compares the transient dazzle of fireworks with the flickering light of the humble earthen lamp that can illumine the path ahead when needed, and is forever ready to combat darkness. Wishing you a comparatively pollution-free winter and hoping that pyrotechnics remain confined to verbal exchanges.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TS Sudhir,"That NT Rama Rao (NTR) would be tossing in his grave seeing son-in-law Chandrababu Naidu joining hands with the Congress party, is what you are likely to hear on the streets of Andhra Pradesh. In 1982, NTR had launched the Telugu Desam on the plank of Telugu   (self-respect) and dislodged the Congress within eight months. Anti-Congressism has been the TDP's principal plank over the years and pretty much its political identity. I see it differently, however. In fact, Naidu has completed what NTR set out to do. The TDP reduced the Congress to a zero in the residuary state of Andhra in the 2014 elections, with not a single lawmaker in the Assembly or Parliament, and four years later, is looking to make it its B-team in the state. But in the long run, the party unit will become a mirror image of its Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh units, dependent on a powerful regional ally for political oxygen. Naidu is a sharp politician. In 2014, when he realised that actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan had the potential to swing Kapu and youth votes, he decided not to sit on pride waiting for the Jana Sena leader to make the first move. He drove to Pawan's residence in Hyderabad to persuade him to join hands. He always ensured he had an ally to bring in the incremental vote – be it the Left parties in the 90s or the BJP in 1999 and 2004, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti in 2009 or the BJP-Jana Sena in 2014. Naidu's alliance with the Congress brings to the table a number of advantages. At an Andhra-level, he will stand to gain from the traditional Congress vote that still exists in almost all constituencies. In a tight contest, that could make the difference between victory and defeat. Two, the Congress with its Reddy leadership could help in cutting into the dominant Reddy base of the YSR Congress, especially in the Rayalaseema districts. Does the state unit of the Congress gain? Zilch. It will have to bear the burden of five years of anti-incumbency of the Naidu regime without having had any role to play in its omissions and commissions. Naidu is also known to be a tough bargainer and is unlikely to give away too many winnable seats to the Congress. Four, most of the senior Andhra Congress leaders were colleagues of YS Rajasekhara Reddy, who Naidu described a decade ago as the `Raja of Corruption'. Would it carry credibility when the likes of Raghuveera Reddy and KVP Ramachandra Rao now join hands with the man who badmouthed their late leader? Expect some disgruntled leaders who are staunchly anti-TDP, to walk out of the Congress. Conversely it will be argued that if the Congress contests alone, it will be an also-ran in the five-cornered contest that will then take place between the TDP, YSR Congress, Jana Sena, BJP and the Congress in Andhra Pradesh. A tie-up with the TDP gives it a realistic chance to take the first step towards making a comeback. The hand of former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy, who is the AICC general secretary, in-charge of Andhra, is visible in this tie-up. Chandy, having helmed the UDF in Kerala and with the experience of working with different parties with their specific political interests, has always emphasised on forging useful political friendships. At the national level, senior leader Veerappa Moily has said Naidu's TDP is welcome to join the UPA. In Telangana, the two parties are fighting on the common plank of opposition to the TRS and that is a strong glue to hold them together. In contrast in Andhra, the ruling party and an opposition party are coming together. Is the Congress party then looking at the TDP through the 24 Akbar Road prism instead of focusing on Andhra? Yes. In the Congress book, the losses in Andhra are insignificant compared to the gains it will make at the national level. The calculation is that the entry of a heavyweight like Naidu, despite Andhra contributing only 25 seats to the Lok Sabha, will bring political heft to the anti-BJP formation. Moreover, Naidu has the experience of having worked with many of the regional players in his previous avatar as United Front convener in 1996-98 and the Congress would look to outsource the task of getting them on board and ironing out their differences to Naidu. The TDP chief has reportedly promised to devote more time to national politics in what he calls is a bid to “save the nation”. But it is not that Naidu does not need the Congress at the national level as well. After the recent Income tax raids on TDP leaders including Rajya Sabha MP CM Ramesh, there is considerable apprehension that the agencies will be tasked with going after those close to Naidu. The TDP therefore needs the surround system to create enough noise nationally should he be directly targeted. The optics of the Naidu-Rahul meeting will also position the Andhra CM in a more national role. Naidu on many occasions has spoken about how he turned down the offer to become PM in 1996-98. Should the UPA have a realistic chance to form the government, Naidu two decades later may be more willing. His visit to Delhi, the second within a week, is also to position him as a contender for the top job. This is also what some of his MPs have been articulating. Apart from the regional and the national angle, there is a personal angle to this as well. If Naidu is able to pull this through – and there are many ifs and buts – and retain power in Amaravati while dislodging the NDA in New Delhi, Andhra, the sunrise state could see a son-rise. Naidu would look to pass on the baton to his son Nara Lokesh, who is TDP general secretary and IT minister in his cabinet now and move to the Centre. Ironically, in 2014, Naidu had pitched for the BJP, underlining that it had promised special status not for five years but for a decade. All will now depend on whether Andhra trusts Naidu with his friendships of the musical chairs variety every five years. (     ) (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Neeraj Gupta," Purnendu Pritam Remember the Bollywood movie ‘Newton’? Yes, the one starring Rajkummar Rao. It was India’s official nomination for Oscars. The film narrates how during an election, a mockery of election process – and Indian democracy – is being made, especially in the naxal-affected areas. Remember the scene from the movie where Pankaj Tripathi (who plays Asst Commandant of the CRPF) explains to the villagers how to vote using an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) and compares it to a ‘game’? The same villagers and tribals shown in the film hail from a remote village called Kongra. Ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh,  decided to visit Kongra and check if the ‘reel voting’ is any different from how the village would be voting in real life. Kongra is a small village with a small population of 1,396 people. It was once a bastion of the Naxals and conducting an election in this area was a tough task. The residents of the village hoped that ‘Newton’ would put their village on the map and basic development would finally reach their village. Kongra village has several handpumps but the water that comes out of them has high quantity of fluoride. People are forced to dig deep into the ground for water and drink the same untreated water. The film ‘Newton’ was applauded and acclaimed internationally for exposing the limits of Indian democracy in remote parts of the country which are Naxal-affected. The residents of Kongra feel that working in the film brought one positive change – realising the positive implications of voting. In the movie ‘Newton’, there is a dialogue that Rajkummar Rao’s character says: Sadly, our politicians are yet to understand this sentiment. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"On Monday, 12 November, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) president Upendra Kushwaha paid a visit to Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) founder Sharad Yadav, fuelling speculations over a potential break up with the NDA. Sharad Yadav had quit Janata Dal United or JD(U) and formed LJD after JD(U)'s party chief Nitish Kumar had decided to return to NDA in 2016. Hence, Kushwaha referring to his meeting with Yadav as a ""courtesy call"" was not enough to silence the alarm bells. Kushwaha has been dealing with increased pressure since Nitish Kumar made his way back to the NDA. This, according to  , is because JD(U) and RLSP ""share a similar social base."" On 31 October, Kushwaha had said that Kumar did not want to continue as Bihar’s chief minister beyond 2020, to which Kumar had retorted, saying, “  (Don’t lower the bar for debate).” Kushwaha took the remark as a barb and said Kumar had referred to him as “ ” (lowly). At present, Kushwaha's major woes include JD(U)‘s alleged attempts at MLA poaching and a seat split that does not meet RLSP's expectations. Kushwaha alleged that Nitish Kumar is trying to poach MLAs from his party, after top JD(U) leaders reportedly met RLSP's Sudhanshu Shekhar and Lalan Paswan. According to  , Shekhar was also offered a ministerial berth and Paswan a parliamentary seat. Asserting that poaching MLAs is a crime, Kushwaha said that he has sought a meeting with BJP chief Amit Shah and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan. It is being speculated that the BJP and JD(U) will contest an equal number of seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. This will leave Kushwaha's RLSP and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP a paltry share, even though in 2014 RLSP had contested and won and LJP had won six out of seven seats. According to  , it is suspected that the BJP and JD(U) will contest 17 seats and LJP and RLSP will have to share share six. Kushwaha said that he would also ask Amit Shah to resolve the ""confusion"" over seat sharing soon, reported NDTV. According to  , the RSLP “is expected to” walk out of the NDA in early December because the BJP is not showing enough signs of intervening in the RLSP-JD(U) divide. In October, Kushwaha had also met with Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

At least 500 people live in these houses made of crushed stones, which are discarded by nearby factories. Residents say they can’t afford to have the walls plastered because they don’t have any money. Locals claim to have paid money to buy land in the ‘illegal settlement’, which lacks basic facilities like water, electricity, and schools. The residents say that they had been charged Rs 500 for paying the ‘electricity bill’ but there is no electricity, or even an electricity connection in the area.

The News Minute,"The Bharatiya Janata Party in Telangana in its manifesto for the upcoming Assembly Elections is likely to promise free distribution of over 1 lakh cows across the state. The scheme will be part of BJP manifesto scheduled to be released sometime this week. “Cow is helpful for agriculture, medicine as well as the rural economy and is a sacred animal. Those interested in cow rearing can get one under this scheme,” said NVSS Prabhakar, the BJP manifesto committee chairman, speaking to TNM on Sunday. “Those interested – farmers, citizens or well-wishers – will be given a cow. In every district, we will give away 3,000 cows. These cows will be given only on auspicious days,” he added. When asked how these cows will be procured and how fodder will be made available for the cows, the BJP leader said, “Different sources are there to arrange for the cows. We can get them from other states. Those who are interested and rearing the cows can avail the scheme and then the individual will have to take care of the fodder,” said Prabhakar. The TRS government had also launched a cattle distribution scheme in 2017 which was aimed at improving milk production in the state. Under that scheme, a 50 percent subsidy was given to 2 lakh dairy farmers in the state who wished to buy buffaloes. “The present VAT rate being charged in Telangana is very high, so we have decided to write off VAT totally. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already asked all states to reduce VAT on fuel. We took this decision keeping his plea in mind,” the BJP leader told TNM. “When people in other states can get fuel for cheaper rates why should people in Telangana alone suffer? We will mobilise state treasury to find other revenue generation sources – human resources, natural resources and some other development resources. There are other options that we can explore,” he added. The party has also come up with sops to attract urban voters in Hyderabad, Karimnagar and Warangal by charging just Rs 6 per month per household for the supply of potable water, he said. “We have decided to supply potable water at Rs 6 per month per household across the state.

Taha Siddiqui ,"Every year, in the last week of October, Kashmiris living outside the South Asian region get together to observe a day that is largely forgotten by the world. They remember what happened on 22 October 1947, and call it a black day. And looting, plundering and killing is what they did when they entered the Jammu and Kashmir Valley, at the behest of Pakistan, the country that today decries the violence happening in Indian-administered Kashmir. Women were made slaves, national treasures were raided, and Muslims were killed by these Pakistani mercenaries. An event to highlight this bloodshed by Pakistan was organised in the city of Brussels (capital of Belgium), the capital of the European Union, on 22 October 2018, by a political party called United Kashmir People’s National Party, which comprises mostly of exiled Kashmiris living in the West – the only region where they feel safe. This reporter had the chance to attend it and meet with its leader Sardar Shaukat Ali Kashmiri, who told him how he was kidnapped by Pakistani military agencies for his activism to call for independence of his homeland. Once Sardar Shaukat Ali was freed, he left Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and is now settled in Europe from where he continues to raise his voice for his people, especially those living in the part Pakistan controls and calls “Azad Kashmir”. Pakistan claims that it went to save its Muslim brethren from Hindu occupation when it entered Kashmir in 1947, but this is misleading to say the least, as I learnt at the gathering organised by Sardar Shaukat's political movement. They also highlighted how Pakistan tried to capture Kashmir from an independent princely state run by a Hindu ruler Hari Singh, even though Pakistan had first agreed to let princely states decide their own fate – and the British, who were dividing South Asia between Pakistan and India in 1947, had agreed to the same. A standstill agreement meant that all agreements that were in practice under the British rule before 1947 with the Kashmir region would continue, as they were with the newly-formed Pakistani state. In response to this tribal invasion, Hari Singh asked for Indian help. The Indians offered it but with conditions – and one of them was that Singh should accede to India, to which he agreed. That is when the Indian troops arrived in the Valley to defend the region against tribal invasion. Also, the world mostly knows what goes on in Indian-administered Kashmir, thanks to somewhat a relative free press there but very rarely do we get to hear about the abuses committed by the Pakistan Army which controls Pakistan-administered Kashmir from the shadows. This year, the United Nations launched its first report on human rights in both India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. While it mainly focuses on abuses of the Indian military, it also calls out to Pakistan to end its “misuse” of anti-terror legislation to persecute peaceful activists and quash dissent. The report states that violations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir “are of a different calibre or magnitude”, while decrying restrictions on freedoms of expression and association. Also local indigenous politicians are denied rights too, as Pakistan has imposed a condition on them that they can   participate if they sign an agreement of accession to Pakistan – a position that many Kashmiri politicians do not agree with, and thus, they have been left out of the electoral process. That is why the governments of Pakistan-administered Kashmir are almost always run by Pakistan-origin political parties. This being said, publicly, Pakistan has portrayed a completely different image to the world whereby it claims that Kashmiris should be given the right to decide for themselves. Also, Pakistan not only captured half of Kashmir when it invaded it in 1947; since then it has also actively tried to divide the Kashmir region it controls into further smaller divisions by carving out a separate Gilgit-Baltistan region, and the district of Chitral, both of which originally were under the Jammu and Kashmir state. The agreement had led to China ceding over 1,942 to 5,180 square kilometres to Pakistan, and Pakistan recognising Chinese sovereignty over hundreds of square kilometers of land in Northern Kashmir and Ladakh. This further weakened Kashmir state, and ensured that if tomorrow, Kashmir  get independence, it will not be able re-claim these regions, which Pakistan has tried to re-label or give away. It is unfortunate that such information remains hidden from the public eye, even in the region where they occurred, i e, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and except for those like the exiled Kashmiris that I met in Brussels (who are on the run due to threats to their lives), no one dares to talk about these facts. An example of this is when it launched a military operation in Kashmir in 1965 under the name of Operation Gibraltar, and in 1999 during the Kargil conflict. Both times, Pakistan was unable to achieve its objectives. And instead of introspection and ending this, or even acknowledging this policy of interference, Pakistan continues to allow militants that commit terrorism in Indian-administered Kashmir to flourish on its soil. This, while shutting down voices like Sardar Shaukat’s which are using peaceful political means to call an end to violence, abuse and injustice on both sides of his divided homeland.

The Quint," Srishti Tyagi Vivek Gupta A staunch RSS ideologue, a hard boiled organisation man, Bengaluru's ""most loved"" MP and the first person to speak in Kannada in the United Nations are some of the connotations associated with Union Minister Ananth Kumar. Kumar passed away in the wee hours of Monday, 12 November, in Bengaluru’s Shankara’s Cancer Hospital. He held the Chemicals and Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs portfolio in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet. Known for his political skill, Kumar, a six-time member of Parliament, had managed to be in the inner circle of the central leadership of the BJP, be it during the heydays of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani and now Narendra Modi. Graduate in Arts and Law, Kumar's journey into public life began due to his association with the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organisation of the Sangh Parivar, which he served in various capacities, including state secretary and national secretary. Kumar had demonstrated against the then Indira Gandhi government's imposition of Emergency and had also got imprisoned for it for about 30 days. Looking for bigger ground in politics, Kumar joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1987, where he went on to take up the responsibilities of state secretary, state president of the Yuva Morcha, general secretary and national secretary. Along with state BJP chief Yeddyurappa, Kumar is among a few party leaders who can be credited for the growth of BJP in Karnataka, as they built the party from the scratch, which paved the way for the installation of the first-ever saffron party government in the south. Kumar began his parliamentary career when he got elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Bangalore South, the constituency which remained his bastion till his passing away. Kumar, who also held positions in various parliamentary committees, was serving as the Union Cabinet Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals and Fertilizers in the Narendra Modi-led government, after winning the 15th Lok Sabha election from Bengaluru south by defeating IT czar Nandan Nilekani. While being a member of the BJP's parliamentary board, Kumar was often regarded as the ""Delhi face"" of the Karnataka BJP who could be counted upon for taking up issues concerning Karnataka. Kumar is married to Dr Tejaswini and they have two daughters Aishwarya and Vijetha. Kumar is the chief patron of Adamya Chetana, an NGO involved in social work which he runs along with his wife in the memory of his mother Girija Shastry. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Avni, the man-eater tigress who was also known as T1, was shot when she was “facing away” from the shooter,   reported quoting the post-mortem witness report. Importantly, the dart on her left thigh did not show any impact of being ""fired” from a tranquilising gun, the  said. Avni is said to have been responsible for 14 deaths in Maharashtra's Yavatmal. She was killed in a forest in Yavatmal on the night 2 November, following a massive operation spanning over two months. The post-mortem witness report, submitted by four veterinarians and wildlife biologist Milind Pariwakam, contradicts the Maharashtra forest department’s claim that Avni was shot in self-defence. Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and the state government have defended the incident, calling it ‘sad’ but necessary after the tigress had attacked forest staff trying to tranquilise it. According to  article, the report includes two illustrations to show the bullet’s “entry point, [a] place where [the] bullet was lodged and the trajectory of the bullet” supporting “that the animal was facing away from the person who fired the bullet”. While the post-mortem report states that “fascia beneath darted needle was intact”, the witness report also uses photographs to show that “the cannula of the dart had gone into the sub-cutaneous layer and had not penetrated into the underlying muscle”. Meanwhile, shooter Asgar Ali maintains that he shot the tigress in self-defence and denied the “trigger-happy allegations” levelled against him. Ali maintains that efforts were made to capture and save the tigress over a period of two years, adding that this time around as well, the team tried its best to capture the animal alive. The forest ministry has ordered an inquiry into the events leading to Avni’s death, led by a committee with two experts — Bilal Habib from Wildlife Institute of India and Anish Andheria from Wildlife Conservation Trust.

Manish Dubey,"It’s the age of crowd-funding, and political parties too are taking it up in election season, because... elections cost money. Back in 2013, as the assembly elections in Delhi approached, the word on ground was that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), was set to challenge the traditional Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Congress duopoly in the state. But a party as insistent on clean campaign funds as the AAP was not going to find the task of funding easy. So they turned to the average Indian internet-user with a Rs 20 crore target. Not only did AAP achieve their target,it went on to make an impressive debut – finishing a close second behind the BJP – both in terms of vote share and seats. The Congress came a distant third. The big development however, is the decision of the Congress party to join the bandwagon. After testing the waters with a couple of small appeals – one for a rural hospital in Odisha that PM Modi had allegedly promised but never delivered; the other on behalf of Dr Yogesh Babu (the Congress candidate against controversial BJP leader B Sreeramulu in the Karnataka assembly elections) – the Grand Old Party is now soliciting funds online for its Rajasthan Assembly Election campaign, and may even do so for the 2019 parliamentary elections. Political parties aside, several off-beat political actors have also started circulating collection plates online for campaign funds. Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and activist Irom Sharmila’s fledgling ‘Peoples’ Resurgence and Justice Alliance’ (PRJA), are examples of this. Globally, online political crowdfunding has come to be seen as an opportunity for lay citizens to re-capture democracies. It has been argued that the citizens’ exercise of collective monetary muscle could give them much-needed leverage over party agendas and lower entry barriers for fresh voices. The Indian polity warming up to the option is a welcome trend. That said, parties would do well to reflect on the in-country experience with online crowdfunding, brief as it may be, before taking the plunge. For there have been misses too apart from hits, and the peculiarities of Indian politics mean that things do not always pan out predictably. AAP’s appeals in Delhi resonated because its leading lights had a track record when it came to standing up against corruption and abuse of authority. Dr Babu’s campaign did not gain traction despite his credentials because his challenge to Sreeramulu may have been seen as being far too ambitious. There is also something to be said about context when it comes to the fund-seeker’s credibility. Sandwiched between the AAP’s successful mobilizations in Delhi was a less successful one for the 2014 parliamentary elections. The same team with the same appeal, while considered equipped to make a difference in Delhi, was doubted for its ability to make a difference on the national canvas. Importantly,   boxes for social capital and meaningful cause may not be enough as the sluggish initial response to the Rajasthan Congress’ appeal suggests. At the time of writing this piece, only   had been raised in the first 40 days. At this rate, the Congress will struggle to mobilise even a sixth of the amount it hopes to by the end of its 77-day fundraiser. This is somewhat mystifying since the Congress pitch is framed no differently than AAP’s was and its challenge in Rajasthan is widely seen as serious. Further, the Congress appeal has been widely publicised and its claims of the BJP soaking up most available election funding are not off the mark. There may be other, more important factors at play however. For one, fear of reprisal could be playing on the supporters’ minds. Amidst the backdrop of what promises to be a bitter and close parliamentary election, supporting a political start-up such as AAP carries lesser risk than supporting a resurgent principal opposition in a crucial face-off. Especially against a ruling party that is not exactly coy about flexing muscle. In this backdrop, the Congress supporter may just prefer the anonymity of existing donation channels. Secondly, notwithstanding the merit in its present appeal, the credibility of its challenge in Rajasthan, and Rahul Gandhi’s persistent and punchy attacks against crony capitalism, question marks linger around the Congress’s motives behind seeking crowdfunding and its long-term commitment to resetting its funding portfolio. The AAP sought crowdfunding in a quest for a citizen-funded party that aspired to remain free of big donor influence forever; the Congress’ solicitation is perceived driven by a cyclical cash crunch, not transformative intent. With AAP, crowds were urged to throw a lifeline; with Congress, they have been invited to an experiment. How enthusiastically they have dug into their pockets, reflects it.

He joined the Congress in the presence of its Madhya Pradesh unit President Kamal Nath and another senior state leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and said the state needs a leader like Nath not Chouhan.

Raunak Kukde,"In an exclusive interview with  , Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee President Kamal Nath, dismissed all rumours about a fracture within the party regarding the selection of party members given tickets to contest the upcoming polls. “Those who have been given party tickets (to contest the polls), are the ones who we believed were the most deserving of them,” he said. About the party’s claim that the final list of candidates was made based on its own “surveys,” Nath said that surveys were indeed conducted, but they only worked as an “input”. Slamming the ruling BJP party in Madhya Pradesh, Nath said that it was a governance that had been based on “false promises” only. He also said there has never been an instance in political history where almost every age-group has been worried about their security and future as they are under the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government. In the interview, Nath said that the successful model of Chhindwara, which is also his nine-term parliamentary constituency, can be replicated in the other constituencies of the state as well. About the party’s decision to field former Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee President Arun Yadav against Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the latter’s home turf of Budhni, Nath said the move was made keeping in mind Yadav’s reputation as a strong leader and as someone who will give hope to the people of the state. He also said that Yadav would put up a good fight against Chouhan. Earlier, Chouhan had said that by pitting Yadav against him, Congress was making Yadav a “scapegoat.” On being questioned about this, Nath said that the chief minister would say whatever he believed would work in his favour for the upcoming polls.

The BJP’s Madhya Pradesh wing on Saturday, November 3, tweeted a video of Nath allegedly endorsing candidates with criminal records, if they are capable of drawing votes and winning elections.

She said that the people of the state will give their “answer” to such an “edited video” on November 28. On Twitter, the BJP responded to Oza and said that any doubts over the credibility of the video could be examined through a forensic test, which would lay bare the facts.

PTI,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's son Kartikey filed a criminal defamation suit Tuesday, 30 October, against Congress President Rahul Gandhi in a local court. Kartikey accused Gandhi of intentionally making a false allegation about his name being in Panama Papers of alleged tax evaders. Gandhi, who had made these comments during an election rally in Jhabua on 29 October, sought to clarify his remarks saying he got ""confused"" and the Madhya Pradesh chief minister's son had no link to the Panama Papers case. In the suit filed in the Special Court of Additional District Judge (ADJ) Suresh Singh through his lawyer Shirish Shrivastava, Kartikey Chouhan has alleged that Gandhi intentionally gave the statement to defame him. The court has scheduled the matter for 3 November when Kartikey's statement will be recorded. The Panama Papers refer to 11.5 million leaked documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2016 with details of offshore entities set up by a Panama-based legal firm.

PTI,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday, 11 November, hit out at the ""critics and cynics"" who blame GST for growth deceleration, saying the indirect tax reform had only a ""transient"" impact on growth and that too for two quarters. In remarks apparently aimed at former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, who on Friday blamed the Goods and Services Tax roll-out along with demonetisation for lower GDP growth, Jaitley said the economy recovered fast from the limited ""disruptionist impact"" of the tax reform. But the minister was silent on Rajan's criticism of the note ban. Though the stated objectives of the move were to curb black money and choke the channels pumping in fake notes into the economy, the RBI in July had stated that as much as 99.3 percent of the cancelled notes had come back to the system and also cash in circulation had topped the pre-note ban days. Interestingly, the government did not celebrate the second anniversary of the controversial decision on 8 November, unlike the first anniversary, when it had listed out the benefits of the move as increased tax payers' base and higher digital transactions. Claiming that GST had a smooth implementation, Jaitley, without naming anyone, said: Jaitley, who was addressing the centenary celebrations of the state-run Union Bank of India through a video message, described GST as a ""monumental reform"" that impacted growth for just two quarters, as GDP numbers since then climbed up to 7, 7.7 and 8.2 percent in the subsequent quarters. He was also quick to point out that these numbers are much higher compared to 5-6 percent achieved between 2012 and 2014 under the previous government. The minister said ever since the Narendra Modi government assumed office, the country has been able to retain its position as the fastest growing major economy. Delivering a lecture in the US on Friday, Rajan – whose three-year stint at the RBI ended in September 2016 two months before demonetisation and almost a year before GST implementation in July 2017 – had termed the twin moves as ""hard blows"" to the economy when global growth was much better. ""The reality is that seven (7 percent growth) is not enough for the kind of people coming into the labour market and we need jobs for them. So, we need more and cannot be satisfied at this level (of growth),"" Rajan had added. Jaitley said ""reforms,"" including GST, demonetisation and the much-contested Aadhaar, have ensured greater formalisation of the economy and made available extra resources which are now being utilised for building infrastructure, rural roads and also for paying for various social sector schemes aimed at uplifting the masses. Within the first year of GST implementation, Jaitley said the number of people who registered for GST has gone up by 74 percent and the government has also been able to bring down tax rates for as many as 334 commodities than previous levels. He reiterated that the Aadhaar and the schemes working through it are alone have helped save over Rs 90,000 crore, and welcomed the Supreme Court order upholding the biometric-based identity project, though with many conditions.

Charan Teja,"Name-calling and jibes at opponents are becoming commonplace in Telangana in the run-up to the elections. The incidents were brought to the notice of the Election Commission, forcing it to issue notices to the politicians. On Friday, 9 November, Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar issued notices to TRS’s Harish Rao, Congress’ A Revanth Reddy and V Pratap Reddy and TDP’s Revuri Prakash Reddy after going through evidence and complaints which alleged that they used foul language and made personal remarks. The barbs are becoming more objectionable, especially with leaders making these remarks at public gatherings. In turn, these videos are going viral on social media platforms, and is trickling down to local WhatsApp groups, where cadres of the parties follow their leaders’ example. The row began when Congress leader Vonteru Prathap Reddy claimed during a campaign meeting in Gajwel that Harish Rao  . Prathap, the candidate the Congress is fielding against caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, alleged at a campaign gathering that there are rifts in the top rung of the TRS, which also consists of members of KCR’s family. Claiming that Harish Rao called him from an unknown number, Prathap said that this is what Harish Rao told him: “Even after working hard for the party for 14 years, after the state was formed, everything is being given to my brother-in-law (KT Rama Rao, caretaker IT Minister and KCR’s son). Prathap, defeat my uncle, and I will work with you. In case you need financial assistance, I'm ready to provide it.” This statement quickly garnered attention and gave rise to speculations of rifts in the family of the TRS patriarch. Telangana-Telugu Desam Party (T-TDP) leader Revuri Prakash Reddy said that Harish Rao has worked hard in the hope that he will be the KCR’s successor, and despite that, he is being shunned. The TDP and Congress are both part of the Mahakutami. While stating that Harish is behind the victories of KCR, Prakash Reddy said, “If there was no Harish Rao, KCR would have got buried in the political timeline a long time ago. I won’t comment on whether what Prathap said is true or false, but given the circumstances, it is no wonder.” In response to their jibes, Harish Rao accused them of indulging in “cheap tricks”. He   that the TDP and Congress are scared of the TRS, and are making “comments which are directionless” in order to deceive. Harish Rao further termed the campaign against him as a “Goebbels campaign,” referring to Adolf’s Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. Congress working President Revanth Reddy, known for objectionable remarks against KCR and his family, commented on the allegations made by Prathap Reddy. He also  a dig at KCR. KCR, KTR and Harish Rao have reportedly been referring to the chief ministerial candidate of the Mahakutami as a “sealed cover CM” – one that has been decided by the higher-ups of the party and one who will listen to them. Taking a dig at this, Revanth said, “If Mahakutami candidate is 'sealed cover CM', isn't it better than your cheap liquor CM?,” calling KCR an alcoholic. He went on to add that KCR knows about the tricks up Harish Rao’s sleeve, which is why he won’t believe him. ""Harish Rao can't prove his loyalty even if he walks on fire. KCR will not believe. Even if Harish beheads himself and gives to KCR, he would say that it is a watermelon, as he (KCR) knows how you have cheated all the people who have believed you. He knows what all you have done clearly,” Revanth said. He further added that Harish is attacking the Mahakutami just to make KCR believe him. While the language and foul remarks by politicians violate the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), several Cultural and Language studies critics are opining that the trend is antithetical to democratic principles. Author, cultural critic and Kendriya Yuva Sahithya Awardee Pasunuri Ravinder, speaking to TNM said that the language and the choice of the words chosen by any politician will reflect their ideology. Observing the current trend, he said, ""The present political campaign/speeches are nothing but the leaders’ wish to succeed in the feudal culture they represent. They're thinking that anything they speak will gain currency. Their language while addressing gatherings is also very akin to demeaning vulnerable sections of society like women, Dalits and other communities.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"The Bharatiya Janata Party touches just enough number of seats to form majority in Madhya Pradesh, said ABP’s opinion poll, made in collaboration with Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), on Thursday, 8 November. According to the poll, the BJP stands at 41 percent, one percent more than 40 percent vote share of the Congress, leaving Others with 19 percent.. The state with 230 seats goes for voting on Wednesday, 28 November, out of which the BJP stands at 116 seats, the Congress at 105 and Others round up at nine. By this calculation, the BJP faces a drop of 49 seats from the 2013 Assembly elections where it secured 165 seats.

Although the BJP still stands first in the ABP-CSDS survey, a noticeable decline in its vote share and seat share is reflected in the survey numbers. The Congress party’s poll performance, though better from the last Assembly elections where it was at 36.38 percent and was able to secure only 58 seats, it still failed to gather majority in the survey. However, the BJP's vote share is expected to increase after Prime Minister Modi's campaign visit in the state which is supposed to take place after 15 November.

Anant Zanane,"A proposal by the chief architect of the  , the Congress’s latest Hindutva offering in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, openly calls for embracing Hindutva and possibly, even getting Congress President Rahul Gandhi to chant  , the BJP’s Hindutva hail. It says, if at the beginning or the conclusion of the   the senior leadership of the Congress (like Rahul Gandhi) raise the slogan of  , people will be likely to join the chorus and this message will resonate across the country. This is proof of an emerging political philosophy within the Congress party. And what’s unfolding in Madhya Pradesh with manifesto proposals like building a   to honour the mythical route of Lord Ram’s exile, is an intended intensification of the party’s ongoing experiments. The   which was all set to begin on 23 September stands postponed for now, but the party says the   is still on and coming soon. But perhaps for the first time a written document, that is, a 12-page proposal authored by the architect of the  , Congress Leader Harishankar Shukla, defines in detail the political design. At a press conference on 13 September at the Congress’s state headquarters in Bhopal, Spokesperson Shobha Oza   Pandit Harishankar Shukla as the head of a 33-member committee called   that will steer the 820 kilometer   touching more than 30 places of religious importance.  has accessed the original draft of the proposal authored by Shukla that explains exactly how the Congress should approach Hindutva in Madhya Pradesh. It begins with a statement of purpose which says “ The proposal says that in a state like Madhya Pradesh which has a predominantly Hindu demographic, religion dictates the lives of people. It suggests that the   will bring the Congress up to speed with the BJP’s brand of Hindutva. Shukla proposes “ Shukla says that for the Congress to counter the BJP’s ‘wrong’ narrative, it is absolutely necessary ( for the party to embark on the   and positively align itself to Hindu religion. The proposal hard-sells the   as a progressive strategy. The   it says, “will help the Congress connect with Hindus and at the same time preserve its image of a party that has a progressive ideology”. What’s also startling is that in his impact assessment of the  , Shukla presents a matrix of stakeholders who will be influenced by this experiment. These stakeholders include Congress party workers, believers of the Hindu faith, godmen, people living along the route of the  , the BJP and its affiliates, Muslims of Madhya Pradesh, traditional supporters of the party and those who dislike the Congress. It categorically concludes that Muslims who have conventionally supported the Congress will remain unaffected by this  . Besides boosting the state’s tourism potential, the proposal summarizes what the   hopes to achieve politically: These clearly-stated political objectives were skipped at the party’s 13 September press conference where the   was primarily showcased as the Congress’s grand idea to revive temple tourism in the state and build an employment ecosystem around it. Critics may argue that Shukla’s written proposal is a hurriedly-prepared amateurish document presented to secure an instant buy-in of the Congress leadership. But Shukla is now leading the   preparations as chief of the committee. He says he handed over his proposal for the   roadmap to the MP Congress Chief Kamal Nath on 21 August. “My party’s president’s (Kamal Nath’s) understanding isn’t fully correct.” Kamal Nath he says, is of the view that “we should not link religion to politics. He does not want to do it for vote-bank politics.” Shukla is hopeful that at some stage during the 19-day  , Rahul Gandhi will join the procession. He says his efforts are on to “make it happen”. Shukla credits the Congress for mainstreaming Ram in India’s politics. He says people have wrongly criticised Rahul Gandhi’s temple visits and his latest Manasarovar  . “It is because of Rajiv Gandhi that prayers first started where   (Infant Lord Ram) was  (seated) behind locked doors. It is the Congress that did everything. I am still hopeful that the party President (Rahul Gandhi) will participate and his leadership will be with us,” said Shukla. The conversation with Shukla also gives a sense of the Congress’s constantly evolving messaging around the  . Not in-your-face Hindutva but carefully crafted to strike a chord with the Hindus. About making Rahul Gandhi chant slogans of  , Shukla clarifies “  (as written in his proposal) was a mistake that crept into the language of the proposal.” Explaining how this initiative will not impact the sentiments of the Muslims, Shukla says, “This will not happen because the Congress respects all religions. No Muslim has any objection to anything that happens in the name of Hindu religion. They support this. Muslims never get upset when Hindus follow their traditions. Which is why I have written that they will not be impacted by this.” He also explains how the   will warm up religious leaders to the Congress, who will help the party during elections. “The Congress has never taken the support of religion. And many   and   are already supporters of the BJP. So when this yatra starts, I hope that   and   will be influenced by this. Since the Congress is the only alternative (to the BJP), it will appeal to them – which isn’t there right now,” says Shukla. Ever since the idea for the   was first unveiled, the Congress has played down its political significance and only showcased it as yet another failed commitment of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to build the path in 2007. Kamal Nath in an interview to   defended it by saying, “Does the BJP have the selling agency of religion? We are all religious, but we don’t bring religion into a political platform.” The purpose behind the yatra he said was not politics but “our religious belief. The sentiments of the people. We are respecting the sentiments of the people and our own belief.” Despite the party’s promise of making  , Rahul Gandhi’s pilgrimage to Manasarovar or the  , the Congress will perhaps never openly admit to courting Hindutva as it comes with the risk of alienating other caste and religious vote-banks. It may even disown this document as the mere brainwave of an enthusiastic party leader like Pandit Harishankar Shukla. What this proposal does show is the Congress’s desperation to enhance its Hindutva appeal and its ongoing attempts to acquire a saffron veneer. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Singh, two-time MLA from Seoni-Malwa who wept openly after the BJP snub, was immediately named as the Congress' nominee for the Hoshangabad Assembly seat in the Opposition party's fifth list, comprising 16 candidates. ""I am grateful to the Congress for nominating me from Hoshangabad. I had been with the saffron family for 58 long years. The BJP denied me a ticket. I want to be in the midst of the people so I am contesting elections,"" Singh told PTI over phone. ""I don't want to sit at home and confine myself to counting prayer beads,"" he added. With the fifth list, released on Thursday evening, the Congress has now announced names for 225 seats in the 230-member MP Assembly. The Congress announced its contestants from Budhni (Sehore), Manpur (Dhar), Indore-2, Indore-5 and Jatara (Tikamgarh) seats on Friday, 9 November. Congress sources said the party was looking for a strong candidate for Budhni to ""confine"" MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan there. Sitting among his supporters earlier on Thursday, the Sikh leader tried to conceal his tears by covering his face for a few moments. ""Will the Congress workers accept him? Is this trend of nursing personal political ambitions right? If he was such a big leader, why he did not run as an Independent candidate,"" Soumitra said.

Mayank Mishra,": Ashutosh Bhardwaj Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been BJP strongholds for years. While the BJP got an unprecedented mandate in the last Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan, we will get to know the mood of the people in these states on 11 December. But all surveys indicate that it is going to be an uphill task for the BJP to retain its absolute dominance in the three states. What impact will it have on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? The three states have a combined Lok Sabha strength of 65 and the BJP had won 62 of them in the 2014 elections. The extent of the BJP's dominance in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan can be understood from the fact that in both the states the saffron party's vote share was a staggering 55 percent. The three states are known to have straight contests between the Congress and the BJP and the BJP's strike rate was 95 percent last time. Surveys suggest that the strike rate is likely to come down. If the strike rate drops from 95 to 60 percent, the BJP is going to lose 23 seats in the three states alone. In fact, the BJP's overall winning strike rate in straight contests against the Congress stood at 88 percent. Of the 189 seats where the two national parties were pitted against each other, the BJP had 166 of them in 2014. If the trend in these three states spreads to other regions, the BJP may end up losing many seats. From the next round of Assembly elections we will get to know how formidable the Modi premium is. Let us recall that the BJP won in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan with an unprecedented vote share of 55 percent. Record jump in vote share was attributed to the Modi premium. Once the results are out, we will get to know the vote catching power of the premium. Some would say that comparing Assembly elections with Lok Sabha elections is a bit unfair. I tend to disagree with the argument for two reasons. In the three states, voting behaviour of the people in Assembly and General elections has been almost identical. And with the entry of ModI jI on the national scene he has been the most important factor in all elections. People either vote for him or against him. Once the Assembly elections are out of the way, coalition building is going to pick up the pace. People keep talking about the index of Opposition unity. If Congress does as well as surveys predict it to potential allies like Mayawati and Samajwadi party will start flocking to the fold of the grand old party. Coalition building will get a new fillip. My sense, therefore, is that even a small dent in the BJP's performance may produce dramatic results. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint," Shohini Bose Vishal Kumar The electoral turf of Chhattisgarh heated up as both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi addressed public rallies in the poll-bound state on Friday, 9 November, ahead of the state elections on 12 November. Modi kickstarted the campaigning in Chhattisgarh with a rally in Jagdalpur, Bastar district on Friday, 9 November, at 1 pm. Speaking at the rally, he took potshots at the previous UPA regime, accusing them of not cooperating with the Raman Singh-led state government. Rahul Gandhi, too, began his two-day visit to the state by addressing a poll rally in Kanker district on Friday, 9 November, at noon. He accused the Modi government of waiving loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of a few businessmen. He also released the party’s manifesto in Rajnandgaon on Friday. Pointing out that it wasn’t until Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the prime minister in 1999 that the Tribal Welfare Ministry came into being, Modi said that Congress considers tribals a vote bank. He also said the BJP will work towards realising the dream with which Vajpayee had carved Chhattisgarh out of Madhya Pradesh. Modi accused the Congress of backing urban Maoists, who he said have ruined the lives of the Adivasi youth. Addressing his first election rally for the state Assembly polls, Modi also said Congress makes ""fun"" of adivasis (tribals). Modi said he will not rest till he fulfils late Atal Bihari Vajpayee's dreams for a prosperous Chhattisgarh, adding that the Congress-led government did not do enough to develop the Naxal-infested Bastar region citing the Maoist menace as an excuse. ""The urban Maoists who live in air conditioned homes in the cities, look clean and whose children study abroad, remote control the Adivasi children in the Naxal-dominated areas,"" Modi said. ""I want to ask the Congress why it supports the urban Maoists when the government takes action against them and come to Bastar and speak against Naxalism,"" he said. Describing Naxals as ""monsters with evil mindset"", the prime minister said earlier governments did not do enough for the development of Bastar region. Modi said no other prime minister visited Bastar as often as he did. ""I have not come empty handed but given you some scheme and development programme. We are working hard to eradicate unemployment, poverty and hunger from the region. Previously there were resources but nothing happened,"" he said. Modi said he wanted to serve the people of Chhattisgarh and fulfil Atal Bihari Vajpayee's dreams of a prosperous state. ""I will not rest till I fulfil his dreams. Chhattisgarh is now 18 years old. There are different dreams and aspirations of 18-year-olds now,"" he said. “Congress speaks of Dalits, deprived sections and tribals but the party considers them as vote banks and not as human beings,” he said. ""Do you want a government which works or one which stops development work?"" he asked at the rally. Modi said his government has never discriminated among people. ""Previous governments did that. Our government works for development of all,"" he said. Ahead of the rally, on Thursday, four civilians and a CISF jawan were killed in a suspected Naxal attack in Jagdalpur. Drawing a comparison with MNREGA, Rahul Gandhi said that about Rs 35,000 crore is allocated annually towards the scheme, meaning that the Modi government has waived businessmen’s loans worth 10 years of MGNREGA allocation. “For the last 15 years, Raman Singh government is in Chhattisgarh and Modi government has been at the Centre for the last 4.5 years – both had promised jobs to youth and security to farmers, but failed to deliver,” he said. “This is the first time we have seen a PM who claims to give Rs 15 lakh in every citizen’s account, promises 2 crore jobs and after winning elections, he makes them pick up the broom to start cleaning up,” he added. Attacking the Raman Singh government in the state for allegedly neglecting Adivasis, Gandhi said that the state government destroyed policies designed for them. “CM Raman Singh and PM Modi promised jobs, but today nearly 60,000 teacher posts, 13,000 lecturer posts are vacant & 3000 Aadivasi schools were shut down. We will ensure that the government vacancies are filled up,” he said. He also touched upon the alleged Rafale scam. Gandhi is slated to address three more public meetings in Khairagarh, Dongargarh and Gunj Chowk, later in the day. Chhattisgarh goes to polls in two phases on 12 November and 20 November.

Anthony Rozario,"Vishal Bhardwaj It will be Chhattisgarh’s fourth Assembly elections starting Monday, 12 November. The state polling, that will happen in two phases, has always had the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress as key rivals, although another contender might steal the show this year. After the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000, Congress formed first government under Ajit Jogi by default as the party had more number of MLAs in the carved out area. In 2003, Raman Singh became the chief minister after the BJP came in power with 50 seats against Congress’ 37. After Ajit Jogi quit the party in 2016 to form his own party, the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, and later joined hands with Mayawati, the alliance may become the deciding factor in the elections. In 2013, with Jogi’s face, Congress was able to secure 18 seats out of 29 seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. Out of the 10 seats reserved for the Scheduled Caste, the BJP won five in 2008, but after Mayawati’s alliance with Jogi, the party might lose on the numbers this time.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader had gone to the event to stage a protest for allegedly not being invited to the inauguration despite being Member of Parliament from the area. Earlier in the day, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain had directed the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Manoj Parida to lodge a police complaint against Tiwari for allegedly indulging in violence at the Signature Bridge inauguration. In his note to Parida, Jain said Tiwari and his associates indulged in hooliganism to overawe the highest functionaries of the government at the event where Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other cabinet ministers were present. ""It is therefore directed that home department immediately lodges a formal complaint with the CP (commissioner of police) and concerned DCP/police station against Manoj Tiwari and his associates..."" he said. AAP MP Sanjay Singh accused the Delhi Police of ""inaction"" in dealing with those responsible for the ruckus at the event and demanded that it register a case against Tiwari. In a letter written to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, he asked why Tiwari had not been booked even 48 hours after the incident. He said the police in the country, particularly in Delhi, worked under ""tremendous political pressure"". Earlier on Tuesday, BJP leaders and workers staged protests across Delhi, demanding Khan's arrest and waved black flags at Kejriwal in Nand Nagri, where he had gone to attend an official function.

The News Minute,"Former Karnataka Minister TB Jayachandra sparked a controversy on Friday, 9 November, after he said that PM Modi's statement during demonetisation, when he asserted he would not be stopped even if he is burnt alive, should be implemented. Speaking on the sidelines of a protest against demonetisation in Tumakuru, Congress leader Jayachandra said: Days after Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were demonetised, PM in Goa made an emotional plea in Goa in November 2016 where he  , “They thought if they pull my hair, I will stop and do nothing. I will not be cowed down. I will not stop doing these things, even if you burn me alive.” The Congress party's state unit held protests against demonetisation in several districts, including Tumakuru, where Jayachandra made the controversial remark against Prime Minister Modi. The state BJP unit took note of Jayachandra's comments and called for the veteran Congress leader to step down. Several BJP leaders in the state, including Leader of Opposition BS Yeddyurappa, criticised the Congress party and its leader for the remarks.

Nihar Gokhale,"“Our village is the size of a coconut shell, how can it take five big resorts?” former sailor Anthony D’Silva let the question hang in the air as a luxury car whizzed past on the narrow village road that leads to Arossim beach in south Goa. A typical Goan village road, roughly five metres wide, curves several times around tiled-roof homes, under a perennial tree cover, before opening up at a dead end amid sand dunes near the Arabian Sea. Two resorts already operate on a four-kilometre stretch near Arossim beach, and developers have proposed three more--two of them on either side of the scenic deadend. The number of major hotels and resorts has increased by   percent from 42 in  to 113 in 2018, according to the state department of tourism. In comparison, budget hotels grew 100 percent from 2,142 in 2008 to 4,286 in 2018. Arossim symbolises the growing conflict between the rise of luxury tourism in Goa, India’s smallest but one of the country’s most prosperous and healthiest states. Goa’s public-health expenditure is four times the Indian average, as     in February 2017; medical facilities abound, and there is no shortage of health professionals; the sex ratio is among India’s best and getting better; and the infant mortality rate is among India’s lowest. As the Goa government now pushes for greater prosperity, driven in part through tourism--which in 2010 (the latest data available) accounted for   percent of the state’s gross domestic product and attracted   in 2017, or five times Goa’s population--residents of places such as Arossim allege encroachment of common land, takeover of the community’s ecological assets and, in some cases, violation of land and environmental laws. By October 2018, nearly 200 hectares of land--or as much as 374 football fields--was involved in seven tourism-related conflicts, affecting about 3,100 people in Goa, according to data collected by  , a network of researchers that maps and collects data about ongoing land conflicts in India. In most of these cases, poor and marginalised communities oppose tourism projects because they fear eviction. In Goa, while direct evictions are rare, tourism conflicts generally involve threats to common land and community resources, which could then lead to evictions. For instance, a golf course is proposing to take over 90% of the land in a village, which includes farmland and forests. To avoid such situations, Goans, like D’Silva, have begun to set aside time from their jobs and families to put up roadblocks, debate in village council meetings on whether these hotels should be allowed to set up, and to fight multiple court cases, challenging the global perception of Goa as a tourism state. In 2017, about 7.8 million tourists  , double the number four years ago, and five times the state’s 1.5 million population. The number of hotels has multiplied as well--doubling every 10 years, with luxury hotels being the fastest growing segment, according to state tourism department   from 1998. The growth in the number of Category A hotels, which includes luxury hotels, is the highest among all hotel categories under the Goa, Daman and Diu Registration of Tourist Trade Act of 1982, and have risen from 29 in 1998 to 42 in 2008 to 113 as of March 31, 2018, data show. One-half of hotels in this category are “star hotels” which are an even more luxurious category of hotels. Although Category A hotels make up just 2% of all hotels, they are far bigger in size, and host   of the rooms available in Goa. An average Category A property would have 110 rooms, three times the number of rooms in smaller hotels under Category B and 25 times that of the lowest Category D hotels. As a result, even though smaller hotels are routinely hauled up for noise and environmental violations, it is the high-end hotels that require large tracts of land, put more burden on local resources, and are often opposed by villagers. In Arossim, resentment against resorts started intensifying in 2006 when a 160-room five-star resort was proposed on a 20-acre beach-facing property. Competent Automobiles, a Delhi-based dealership of Maruti Suzuki cars, had purchased the property from a wealthy landlord who held a Portuguese-era land title to it. There is no dispute over the sale, but two separate groups of villagers--Cansaulim Villagers Action Committee (CVAC) and Cansaulim-Arossim-Cuelim Civic and Consumers Forum (or CAC-CCF)--argue that although the site is a private property, it is ecologically important to the community because storm water drains carrying excess rainwater from the village converge into the property before draining out into the sea. It is also the regions’ biodiversity “hotspot”, supporting a large green cover, fauna and medicinal herbs. “The property is such an eco-sensitive area,” said Marconi Correia, a Cansaulim-based physician who heads the CAC-CCF. “It also hosts two storm water drains that were named by our ancestors.” On the recent morning, a dense coconut orchard played games with the morning sunlight on the resort land. Peacocks called from tree canopies, around green paddy fields bordered by water channels. The water channels converge into a bigger channel that cuts through the beach sand and drains into the sea. “These water channels are the lifeline of the village,” D’Silva said, as he showed this reporter how smaller drains wind across the landscape to meet at the property. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) said that the central environment ministry had arbitrarily exempted the resort from obtaining the environment clearance required under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, which could have included a study of the site’s environmental parameters, according to its January 2017   in an appeal filed by the CAC-CCF and CVAC. The NGT directed the ministry to follow the process for the environment clearance. “Somehow the environment ministry was inclined to clear the project,” Correia said. In December 2017, with all clearances in hand, Competent Automobiles sold the property to Daffodil Hotels Pvt Ltd, another Delhi-based firm, which tried to commence construction of the resort. But the residents stepped up their resistance. In February 2018, villagers blocked   from felling trees at the property, while a gram sabha, or village council meeting, in May witnessed   and heavy police presence, as several protestors asked the panchayat to revoke the project’s licenses. In July, they carrying construction material and cabins to the site. “We will not allow the resort at any cost,” said Mallika Fernandes, a CVAC member. Villagers said their resistance to the resort has held off the other two proposed projects in Arrosim. “If this project comes then the other two would also get approved. But our village doesn’t have that kind of carrying capacity,” said Fernandes. Competent Automobiles and Daffodil did not respond to questions from   about the environmental impacts of the proposed resort, and concerns raised by the village groups. No study has been undertaken to determine how many large resorts Goa’s coasts and hinterland can take. Master plans prepared in 1987 and 2001 were shelved following public opposition as these plans recommended increasing the number of resorts in both coastal and non-coastal areas without assessing the state’s ecology. “There has been no clear nor firm policy relating to tourism,” the World Bank said in a   on Goa’s tourism industry. Though the government approved luxury hotels on an “ad hoc basis”, the report said, there was a positive bias towards hotels aimed at “upmarket tourism”. In 2013, the Goa government asked the international consultancy KPMG to design yet another tourism plan. In 2014, Goa introduced a new state investment  that talked of “encouraging more boutique and luxury hotels”. “The government has increased its focus on high spending tourists with a potential to significantly impact the state economy and provide employment,” the policy said. A   released in 2016 called for “an emphasis on enhanced quality and quantity of higher spending tourists, both domestic and foreign”, but did not spell out the state’s carrying capacity for luxury facilities. The plan is   in the coming months. In February 2018, state cabinet minister Vijai Sardesai had courted controversy by  budget tourists “scum of the earth”, while arguing for bringing more “rich tourists” and golf courses into Goa. “We must have high-end facilities and get high-end tourism, which benefits the sons of the soil,” he said. Sardesai’s comments seemed ironic to people in the coastal hamlet of Tiracol, arguably the most known tourism-related conflict in Goa. In 2012, Leading Hotels, a Delhi-based firm, had proposed to build an international-standard golf course and resort   in Tiracol, roughly 90 percent of the total land in Tiracol. The project grabbed headlines in 2015 after villagers, who tried stopping the property’s construction, were roughed up by company-hired “bouncers”. That sparked protests across the state with calls to ’Save Tiracol, Save Goa’. Proposals to introduce star hotels and tourism projects in the state’s green interiors, away from the beach--which the draft tourism plan argues for--have also sparked conflicts. Villagers of Quellosim village, about 10 km inland from Arossim, are opposing the commercialisation of Kesarval, an all-year spring and monsoon waterfall that has, for decades, drawn visitors who believe in the water’s medicinal properties. Although Kesarval is barely a minute away from the busy National Highway 17, a pristine evergreen forest and moss-covered stones surround the spring. In June 2018, the Goa Tourism Development Corporation floated a tender to select a developer to build a “three-star or higher category business hotel” on six acres of land around the waterfall. Before the bidding could open, the Save Kesarval Spring Movement  . “This is a heritage site and a lifeline for our village,” said Lopinho Xavier, an engineer from Quellosim. In 2017, the village panchayat had resolved to help rejuvenate the spring, which was affected by illegal borewells at a nearby industrial estate. A star hotel would defeat the purpose, and take away historic public property from the villagers, said Lopinho. “Gawdes worked hard to develop the village and its land. After a hotel comes up who knows if we can enter [there],” Lopinho said, referring to his Adivasi community, considered to be among Goa’s earliest settlers. Lopinho had come to the fore in 2015 to oppose another “mega tourism” project in Quellosim, which was titled “Mini India”, where tourists could go boating around giant replicas of India’s famous monuments floating in 12 acres of a tidal waterbody near the Zuari river. The project, proposed by Pune-based Movaj Enterprises, was approved by the chief minister-led Investment Promotion and Facilitation Board, created under the state industrial policy of 2014. The project’s construction was stalled after a site inspection ordered by the NGT showed that the project site was, in fact, in a “no development zone”. In coastal areas, the growth of tourism has led to the privatisation of commons that support traditional livelihoods and community resources, said the Centre for Responsible Tourism, a Goa-based NGO backed by the Roman Catholic church, in a 2017 note titled ‘People Over Profits’. “In the specific context of Goa, tourism policy must focus on ‘rights holders’. . .rather than ‘stakeholders’,” the note said. “These are two entities whose interests often contradict each other and tend to be in direct opposition.” For much of the 1990s, large hotels were taken to court by a handful of citizen groups and NGOs for violations of coastal zone norms and encroachment of public access to the sea. As the number of luxury hotels increased over the years, so did opposition against them. For many Goans, like Anthony D’Silva of Arossim, the arrival of resorts in their village meant the possibility of new job opportunities outside traditional occupations--hopes that were soon dashed. “There was no development in the village until the two resorts came. But even when the resorts were built, no Goans were hired in white collar work and were only offered sanitation jobs. In one resort I was told about a vacancy as an assistant waiter, not even a full waiter!” D’Silva said. At the same time, ecological costs began mounting. “In 2012 we caught the resort red-handed throwing raw sewage into the sea. The other resort levelled sand dunes to improve the seaview,” he said. “Now we don’t want any more mega hotels,” D’Silva added. “We were opposing the project when my first child was born, who is now six years old and we are still fighting,” said Viana D’Silva, Anthony’s spouse. The couple have been at the forefront of the movement against resorts in their village, and raised funds to fight the court cases through events such as charity music concerts in the village. “I don’t know the project proponents, but I do know my village and its beauty,” said Viana. “I want to give it to my children as I know it.”   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Raghav Bahl,"Exactly two years ago, to the day, Prime Minister Modi had demonetised India’s cash. While most analysts were bewildered, struggling to figure out “heck, what just happened”, I had  categorically that Modi’s missile would be a dud. Now, I am not a renowned economist or monetary theorist. I just relied on my entrepreneur’s instinct, having seen people “live through” crises, cash shortages and threats to expropriate property. They usually hang on for dear life. They fight back. They clutch at straws. They survive. So I was clear that they  wash every bit of cash back into their banks! I am now watching, with equal mortification, the misadventure that Modi is planning to inflict on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Frankly, my mind boggles at the audacity of coercing RBI to pay a special dividend of Rs 3.6 lakh cr, equal to nearly 40 percent – pause and repeat, 40 percent – of reserves accumulated over decades. The other day, I got into a Twitter spat with two extremely distinguished gentlemen, one a much feted former CFO of Infosys, and the other a principal economic advisor to the Modi government. For those of you who like their scraps in 280 characters at a time,  are the  . I have replayed these two conversations in my mind a million times since then, to understand if I got it wrong. But a million times the answer has come back, unequivocally – what these esteemed gentlemen are saying is intellectually refined stuff; but it’s still a bit of monetary sophistry. Whichever way you cut it, RBI will have to print cash or sell assets if it has to pay this special dividend. All other theories are simply putting lipstick on a pig. At an instinctive, entrepreneurial level (here, I am trotting out my post-demonetisation hat again), the conundrum is not that complex. The only way I can pay cash to somebody is by either selling/mortgaging my assets, or, if I don’t have enough of that, I could, heaven forbid, just steal it from my neighbour. It can pay cash by selling/mortgaging assets, or by printing currency. Any other way is just, well, academic sophistry. So, how can Prime Minister Modi pick up his Rs 3.6 lakh cr “bounty” from RBI’s balance sheet? There are, fundamentally, just FIVE ways he can do that, three under the “asset monetisation” route, and two under the “print cash” manoeuvre, without counting the myriad tweaks or derivatives, all of which shall arise from one or more of these core methods. Allow me, therefore, to give you the downstream impact of all these “options”. But before we list them out, let’s X-ray the innards of RBI’s reserves, using rounded off numbers for simplicity:  it’s critical to understand the importance of  here, ie these are non-cash gains. For example, if RBI bought gold at Rs 10,000 per 10 grams in 2000, then it’s made an “ gain of Rs 15,000 per 10 grams. Likewise, if it bought 1 USD in April this year for Rs 65/dollar, then it’s made an  gain of Rs 8/dollar. Now let’s examine each of the five options: Now, in a tweak to point number five, it has been suggested (in my Twitter spat) that this will be cash neutral if the government uses this additional asset to extinguish its liabilities, because eventually, through a series of inter-related accounting adjustments in banks’ and RBI’s balance sheets, all assets/liabilities will get neutralised. What if the government were to declare a universal basic income of Rs 3,000 per citizen? I know this is an extreme assumption, and I am using it merely illustratively, but can you even imagine the amount of multiplier cash such a political gimmick could create? So sirs / madams, let’s just accept the inevitable. The only way RBI can  pay a special dividend of Rs 3.6 lakh cr to Modi is by printing cash... and that’s a terrible idea. And I am not even making a big ado here about it being an “illegitimate” practice, outlawed by India’s Companies Act. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TS Sudhir,"On Thursday, 8 November, even as Nara Chandrababu Naidu was on his way to Deve Gowda territory in Bengaluru to play headhunter for the UPA ahead of 2019, he was being placed in the dock in Hyderabad. Telangana's Irrigation Minister T Harish Rao released a chargesheet against Naidu, accusing the Andhra Pradesh chief minister of working against the interests of Telangana. Rao cited 19 instances when the Naidu regime in Amaravati had written to the Centre raising objections to irrigation projects in Telangana. “Naidu does not want Telangana to be self-reliant in power. He wants to show Telangana is not the place to set up industries and divert them to Andhra,” charged Harish Rao. There is a reason why the Telangana vs Andhra rhetoric is being raised at election time in Telangana. Naidu's Telugu Desam is part of the Mahakutami or the grand alliance with the Congress, the CPI and the Telangana Jana Samiti. If the vote transfer between these parties takes place efficiently, the arithmetic of the alliance can pose a serious challenge to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and its leader, K Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly referred to as KCR. When the Telangana assembly was dissolved on 6 September, the TRS had come up with the slogan ‘KCR versus nobody’, The intention was to be arrogantly dismissive of the opposition. But with the realisation of the formidable math dawning on the TRS, the party strategists have decided to make the Telangana election a `KCR versus Naidu' contest. This despite the TDP contesting just 14 of the 119 seats, with the Congress taking the lion's share of over 90 seats. But why focus on the junior partner of the Opposition instead of the Congress, the principal rival? After all, the Telugu Desam is no longer a force to reckon with in Telangana. 13 of its 15 MLAs in the Telangana legislature deserted the party between 2014 and 2018, making the TDP look like a poacher's delight. This is because the TRS is consciously working on a narrative that positions Naidu as the brain behind the alliance, the man who is moving the levers of the campaign, both financially and strategically. The aim is to play on the fears of the common man and woman of Telangana that with Naidu lurking in the shadows, Telangana will be a separate state only in name because Andhra leaders will rule it by proxy. Telangana pride is being invoked once again with the Congress accused of “sleeping with the enemy”. Asaduddin Owaisi, the friendly ally of the TRS, dipped into history to underline the point better. “Mahakutami is the East India Company of 2018,” he said, asking if the decisions of Telangana will be made by Naidu who sits in Vijayawada. KT Rama Rao, the chief minister’s son calls Naidu the “storywriter, scriptwriter, director of the Mahakutami”. On the campaign trail, KCR called the TDP chief “a `Telangana drohi', traitor, thief, backstabber, wicked person.” What made matters worse was the allegation that intelligence cops from Andhra were snooping around in Telangana trying to conduct poll surveys in the garb of journalists and in a couple of cases in Dharmapuri and Mancherial, accused of distributing cash. Not that this is the first KCR and co are targeting Naidu. In the run-up to the 2014 elections, KCR had similarly attacked Naidu, accusing him of standing in the way of statehood for Telangana. But when KCR re-uses a weapon four years later, it makes people suspect if he fears that his developmental work report card is not good enough to win the election. The TRS is confident that the Target Naidu policy will fetch electoral dividends, especially in the northern districts of Warangal, Karimnagar and Nizamabad where the Telangana sentiment is strong. The flip side however is that this could affect the TRS chances in more urban pockets like Hyderabad where a significant native population from Andhra lives. Keeping this in mind, the opposition alliance is likely to allot more urban seats to the TDP. The Grand alliance is aware that the TRS attempt to focus on Naidu could hurt its chances. Which is why the strategy would be to highlight the Telangana sons of the soil of the alliance and let Naidu campaign only in areas with a significant Andhra population. Interestingly, the bashing Naidu gets in Telangana may end up benefiting him in Andhra. With elections due in Andhra in six months, Naidu won't mind the charge of Andhra love thrown at him by his rivals. There is also a TRS subtext to this ferocious attack on Naidu. The air has been thick for several months with a power struggle within the ruling party, between KTR, the son and Harish Rao, the nephew. Even though the latter is senior in politics and within the TRS, it is obvious to everyone that it is KTR who is calling the shots and would succeed KCR eventually. Also while Harish Rao has been confined to campaigning in his Siddipet constituency and in KCR's Gajwel constituency, KTR is leading the campaign touring all over Telangana. With the Congress and TDP constantly claiming that Harish Rao has been talking to KCR's rivals, the chargesheet against Naidu is seen as the nephew's effort to endear himself to his uncle and prove his loyalty.

Manasa Rao,"In a bid to shore up support for an anti-BJP front ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections, DMK President and Leader of the Opposition in Tamil Nadu MK Stalin assured his support to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu following a meeting between the two in Chennai on Friday. Speaking to reporters in Chennai following the meeting, the Andhra CM denied that he would be the face of the this new front. When the Andhra CM was asked about who, among the senior leaders would be the face of this front, he said, ""We are all together. I am only bringing everybody together in one platform. They will decide how to take forward."" Meeting the DMK President MK Stalin at his residence in Chennai on Friday evening, the TDP Chief said that democracy and the nation was in danger from the current BJP-led NDA rule at the centre. Slamming the central government for ‘abusing’ autonomous government bodies like the CBI and the RBI to fulfill its political agenda, Naidu conceded that his meeting with Congress President Rahul Gandhi earlier this month came despite the differences between the TDP and the Congress. The TDP is part of the Mahakutami or grand alliance led by the Congress for the Telangana Elections. When TNM pressed the Andhra CM on how exactly these internal differences would be resolved, he said, ""One or two of us may have some differences. Either it will be difference of opinion or differences. We had differences with the Congress for the last 40 years. We joined together. Now how to bring everybody together?” MK Stalin said that he had welcomed the efforts put in by Chandrababu Naidu to bring together all the leaders of the opposition parties when the former met Congress President Rahul Gandhi recently in New Delhi. “Already the rights of the states are being clamped down by the central government. All leaders of the opposition parties must join hands to defeat the BJP. In order for all leaders to work together, Chandrababu Naidu met me today and asked me for the DMK. I have assured my wholehearted support” Stalin stated. Stalin also said that he would join the leaders in a meeting that is soon to be held. The meeting comes a day after Chandrababu Naidu met JD(S) Supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru on Thursday to hold talks about the formation of a Third Front for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Naidu had also called on Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his residence in New Delhi to bring together opposition parties as a single unit against the BJP-led NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “We have to save the nation and defend democracy. It is a democratic compulsion and we have joined together to protect our country,” Chandrababu Naidu told the reporters after the meeting. Earlier in October, Chandrababu Naidu had met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, BSP leader Mayawati and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah regarding the formation of the third front. The TDP leader also met Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav and former Union minister Yashwant Sinha as part of his efforts to bring together opposition parties against the Modi government in the 2019 elections.

The Quint,"On the second anniversary of demonetisation, Congress President Rahul Gandhi in a press release called demonetisation a “tragedy”, adding that the move was a “self-inflicted, suicidal attack” that destroyed millions of lives and ruined thousands of India's small businesses. Gandhi in the press release further criticised Finance Minister Arun Jaitley by calling him ‘incompetent’ and for defending the government’s ‘criminal policy.’ Meanwhile, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram in an address to the media in Kolkata indicated that demonetisation has costed BJP all the by-elections since 2016, recent being in Karnataka. Reiterating ‘consequences of demonetisation’, Chidambaram began his address by stating that the government failed to deliver on all the ‘three objectives’ at the time of the announcement of demonetisation. He further added that millions were in debt while the GDP fell by one and a half per cent, following the ‘infamous demonetisation’. The Congress had also said it will hold a nationwide protest on Thursday, to mark two years of demonetisation. Meanwhile, the party has demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologise for “ruining and wrecking"" the economy. Congress President Rahul Gandhi in a tweet denounced demonetisation as a sly scheme made for the prime minister's allies to turn their black money into white. The tweet that was put out in Hindi, also called ‘note-bandi’ a well-thought through cruel scheme. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor shared a graphic on the ‘cost of demonetisation’, which detailed the cost incurred in printing new notes, the jobs and lives reportedly lost, and the fall in the GDP post the exercise. Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot also took to Twitter to claim that several people who had been affected by demonetisation, were still struggling to make ends meet. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, too, took to Twitter to slam the Modi government over its decision to demonetise currency notes of higher denominations, stating that the people would ""punish those who took the decision”. Meanwhile, CPI politburo member Sitaram Yechury questioned the lack of celebrations by the government. The Aam Aadmi Party shared a video of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal touting demonetisation as the “biggest scam in the history of independent India.” Congress leaders and workers will protest on Thursday against the ""complete demolition"" of the Indian economy unleashed by the ""Tughlaqi  "" of demonetisation two years ago, spokesperson Manish Tewari said at a press conference on Tuesday, 6 November. The prime minister stood up two years ago on November 8 and addressed the nation, demonetising almost Rs 16.99 lakh crore in circulation, Tewari said. The three reasons given for demonetisation were that it would curb black money, weed out fake notes and proscribe terror financing, but two years later none of those objectives have materialised, Tewari alleged.

Srinivas Kodali ,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has recently made a representation to the Election Commission of India about large scale deletion of voters in Delhi. AAP party chief Arvind Kejriwal who has made the representation, has asked for a list of deleted voters to be published on the Election Commission website and further a field verification to be carried out in the presence of representatives from all parties. The EC has denied the large-scale deletions being carried out. The Commission has also denied similar complaints regarding duplicate voters and deletions in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. It is surprising that the Election Commission is denying there have been large scale deletions considering their own   this list of voters who have been deleted suo motu. According to the   from 2008, the ERO is allowed to suo motu delete voters under   But suo motu deletions are usually done for voters who have died, and there are death certificates to delete the voters. Delhi in 2015 does not seem to be the first time suo motu deletions have been carried out. A report from   says 2.8 lakh voters have been deleted suo motu in West Bengal during 2011 using a latest de-duplication software. on electoral roll management system offers insights on how the commission uses information technology (IT) to manage voters. The manual clearly shows how the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) has the power to suo motu delete voters. The ERO is a quasi judicial authority and his say on deletions of voter is final, but he has to give a reasonable notice to the citizen and also hold a public hearing to listen to any contestations. While in practice whether fair opportunity is being provided to hear a citizen is not always clear. Even with the law allowing suo motu deletions, the scale of voter deletions in Delhi is a problem, considering over 10 lakh voters who were deleted and 13 lakhs who were added, comprise more than  . A look at Central Information Commission order   shows there were indeed people who have been unable to vote in 2015 and have filed Right to Information (RTI) application with the Election Commission, asking for details on how the names have been deleted off rolls. The proof of sufficient notice being issued to the appellant has been provided to the Information Commissioner on a   where the order was overturned. Large-scale deletions, whether suo motu or otherwise, can’t be done without the knowledge and special permission of the Chief Election Commissioner. An RTI filed with the Election Commission shows the State Election Commission of Bihar has been asking permission to delete voters suo motu   the Bihar elections. The Election Commission has given the permission to delete the voter suo motu but strictly reminding to follow the procedures of issuing notices and asserting the reason of deletions. Even with the information of deleted voters on the Election Commission website, the statistics published by the Commission show there was no decrease of voters in Delhi. Delhi had a increase of voters from   to   over 5 years. While the Commission’s documents indicate large scale deletions of voters in poll-bound Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The inconsistency of non-standardised publication of information by the Election Commission is creating doubts on the intentions of suo motu deletions, with Kejriwal alleging the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and BJP has directed the commission to delete a certain group of voters. In the other poll -bound states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress party has been alleging disturbances in voter lists with many duplications being found. The Election Commission has denied there are any duplicates and even fought the matter when leaders from Congress approached the Supreme Court in  . The Supreme Court, while siding with the Election Commission, has allowed them to set the standards of transparency in not publishing voter rolls in machine-readable formats. What is happening with voter deletion is not entirely clear. The Election Commission needs to step in and makes things more transparent. The longer the Commission denies it has no knowledge of the matter and claims it is enquiring, the larger the threat to democracy.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Mayank Mishra,"Ashutosh Bharadwaj When asked why BSP chief Mayawati seems non-committal on an alliance, a political expert told me:   (What’s the point of waking up after losing everything?) She carries the reputation of a strong leader, one who has the rare distinction of transferring votes to whichever party she allies with. She is considered to be the most prominent Dalit leader and we all know that Dalit votes are significant enough to alter political equations in almost all Lok Sabha constituencies. It is, therefore, incumbent on Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party and the Congress to bring her on board. I mapped the relevant data of the last five elections – three Assembly and two Lok Sabha – that have taken place in politically significant Uttar Pradesh. The BSP’s performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha and the 2017 Assembly elections has been pretty dismal. In the Parliamentary elections, her party had its worst performance in the last 25 years. What is worse, the BSP could establish a lead in a mere nine of the 403 Assembly segments – worse than the seemingly weak Congress, which had a lead in 15 segments. Three years later, in the 2017 Assembly elections, the BSP’s winning strike rate, at an abysmal five percent, was worse than the Congress’ six and SP’s 15. While the dismal performance of the BSP in 2014 was considered a one-off event, a repeat down the line was a vindication of the growing view that her party faces an existential crisis. So, what has changed? Ever since its inception, the BSP has been receiving a fair amount of Dalit votes in the country. It secured nearly 18 percent of all Dalit votes in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and it peaked at 22 percent in 2004. But it fell sharply to just 14 percent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. That was the first clear indication that not all Dalits were voting for Mayawati. More specifically, in Uttar Pradesh, while the BSP secured 48 percent of all non-Jatav votes in the 2012 Assembly elections, it could secure only 30 percent of such votes two years later, in the general elections. This suggests that while there is a constant erosion in Mayawati’s appeal amongst her core support group, consisting of Dalits, expected headway among others is yet to bear any fruit. The general elections next year are going to be a crucial test of her political revival. There is a real possibility of making a mark if she rides the alliance bus. Or else, she runs the risk of getting marginalised. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Vaibhav Palnitkar,"Video Editor: Abhishek Sharma MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has won the most number of Assembly Elections in the state. But facing his fourth election this year, Chouhan seems to be under pressure. Looks like what was his strength so far has now turned into his weakness. We are saying this because ever since the  new SC/ST Act there has been polarisation. Core BJP voters have formed a new party who claim to divide BJP's votes. The Swarn community of MP are angry because of the new SC/ST Act and SC/ST reservation in promotion. In retaliation, they have formed SAPAKS – 'Samanya Pichra Aur Alpsankhyak Varg Karmchari Sanstha’. Many people are joining meetings of this party. They have announced to fight elections from 230 seats. The nearly 15 percent of Swarn votes in the state have been BJP's core voters for 30 years. Apart from this, 37 percent voters belong to backward classes. So, SAPAKs can breach core BJP voters. From Rohit Vemula's disappearance to the Una incident that happened during four years of the Modi government. Dalits are unhappy with both the Centre and the state government. Nearly 16 per cent voters in MP belong to the SC Community. The nationwide Dalit strike on 2 April saw massive protests in Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior and other nearby areas. Dalit protests are a big concern for the BJP. MP's youth organisation 'JAYS' has managed to hold grounds in MP's tribal areas. 23 per cent of voters in MP are adivasis. Talks over an alliance with the Congress is underway. However, JAYS has announced that if an alliance with the Congress is not formed, they would fight the election independently. Congress' alliance with the JAYS can pose as a threat to the BJP. Along with this, there is also the issue of farmer’s woes. Shivraj Singh was considered very popular among farmers. But six farmers were killed during the farmers' protest in Mandsaur last year. Ever since then farmer's agitation against the government has become very evident. On the other hand, Congress has promised farm loan waivers to the MP farmers. CM Shivraj Singh embarked on an 'Ashirwad Yatra' as a part of his election campaign. But during the majority of the tour, he was seen as the lone campaigner. Apart from some Union Ministers of the BJP, none from the central government registered their presence. There were also reports of lesser crowds and empty   during the 'Ashirwad Yatra'. In the 2013 assembly elections, one of the main reason for Shivraj's victory was the Modi wave and the anti-incumbency factor against the then Central government. This time, the Modi factor is not as strong and 4-year anti-incumbency of the Centre can work against Shivraj. In short, it's a tough road for Shivraj this time.

Their victories show how much Trump’s control of the GOP has increased.  Trump looks to be in a better position for re-election than many commentators had believed. The Democrats did take back the House, but that is par for the course in midterm elections. What’s more telling is that they did not invade Trump territory – the deep-red parts of the South, Midwest and Rust Belt – in any substantial way. Winning control of the House could make life difficult for Trump, but the Democrats cannot remove him from office   in the Senate - which seems a world away. Also, the midterms should make it a near-certainty that no serious Republican will challenge Trump for the presidential nomination in 2020. He has proven once again that he is an impressive electoral campaigner with a crude but effective grasp of strategy.  The highly contentious   over Trump’s Supreme Court pick seems to have energised his base more than the Democrats’. The Democrats in red states   lost their re-election bids – Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Meanwhile, the only Democrat to vote to confirm Kavanaugh – Senator   – won his race in predominantly Republican West Virginia.  Texas Senate candidate  looked like he might be this figure – a person to   much the way then-Senator Barack Obama did in 2008 – but O'Rourke   against incumbent Ted Cruz, despite a very tight contest. Democrats still need a platform that is about more than “Stop Trump.”  A  (260) ran for Congress this year. Early results suggest that many white, female voters who backed Trump in 2016 went for Democratic candidates this time around, reflecting the salience of healthcare as a key election issue for Democrat voters. But not all winning female candidates in the midterms were Democrats. Marsha Blackburn, a staunch Trump supporter and   of the Central American migrant caravan,   for the open Senate seat in Tennessee.  Trump was widely condemned for his anti-Hispanic immigrant stance in midterm campaigning. The paradox is that the more Republicans can appeal to Hispanics, the more likely they are to win next time. According to exit polls, the Republicans   in the midterms, compared to nearly 45% captured by  . If they are able to increase this margin to between 35 to 40%, this might be enough to turn purple states like Florida and Nevada reliably red.  Americans still rather like split-ticket voting, meaning they are fine voting for different parties on the same ballot. This makes the notion of exclusively red and exclusively blue states an exaggeration. For example, Democratic candidates picked up governorships in traditionally Republican states, such as  , a hard-line, anti-immigrant Trump ally. And Republicans won several governor races in traditionally Democratic New England.  The state remains essentially impossible to call. Polling trends were  , with losses by Democrats   and  . As purple a state as they come, Florida could well determine the next several presidential elections. The bottom line after the midterms is that Trump is here to stay. And though the Democrats now control the House, this has just offered him a foil – an institution to define himself against – as he moves toward re-election in two years time.

Arun Dev,"The Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition has passed its first litmus test. Putting up a joint front, it won four seats; in one seat, despite the loss, they gained in vote share. The key takeaway from the results is that the coalition has managed to win more than 45-60 percent of the votes in all the five constituencies. The results have put the BJP in a tight spot because there was an erosion of votes in both the seats where they were incumbents. Even in south Karnataka, where they managed to make gains unlike the Congress-JD(S), their increase in vote share was restricted to 10-20 percent. This is crucial as the BJP was hoping to get a large chunk of the Congress’ vote in the old Mysuru region. Most importantly, in Shivamoga and Ballari, the coalition partners managed to have a near total transfer of votes. A comparison of the votes won by the Congress and the JD(S) individually in the previous elections, and their performance as an alliance in the by-election indicates this transfer of votes. Here’s a breakdown of the vote share for the Congress-JD(S) coalition, and the BJP: In Ballari, the BJP has lost 13.9 percent vote share since 2014, and the coalition has increased its vote share by 16.53 percent. Clearly, the Congress and JD(S) have eaten into BJP's vote bank in Ballari. There is a near-perfect transfer of JD(S) votes to the Congress in Shivamoga. Despite the loss, the BJP had increased its vote share, but only by 20.35 percent. The BJP is believed to have eaten into Congress' vote share in Mandya, but the BJP needed a larger shift in votes here to make their presence felt in this region. During the assembly elections, two independent candidates, one of them a BJP rebel, had secured 28.85 percent of the votes in this constituency . The Congress has likely gained these votes and consolidated its victory, while BJP’s vote share increased only marginally. The BJP increased its vote share by 7.9 percent despite its candidate backing out of the race days before the bypolls. But this increase is too small to threaten the coalition in the region.

We are yet to understand and experience the full impact of the demonetisation exercise.

T M Veeraraghav,"Kamal Haasan does not have a history of big birthday celebrations. As a star, he had urged his fans to do social work instead of coming to meet him on his birthdays and, as he celebrates his first birthday as a politician, he has done the same. Politicians need to keep giving gifts, often literally, before they receive one from the electorate and as he turns 64, Kamal may have to start gifting the people concrete politics over star dialogues. So, what’s the first concrete political gift he can give Tamil Nadu? It will be names of candidates to 20 assembly constituencies that are likely to head into by-elections after the Madras High Court upheld the order disqualifying 18 dissident legislators of the AIADMK led by TTV Dhinakaran. If he hopes to break through the organisation structure of the established parties, he needs candidates who can take up the fight at the grassroots level. He has already declared that his party will contest the bypolls, if and when they are held, but there seems to be no clear face for his party in these constituencies. Does he have the candidates? Party insiders suggest that he is working on it, but do not reveal any further. The task is more difficult for Kamal Haasan because he has projected himself as the face of change, not just a change in administration, but a change in political culture. Can he find candidates to represent that change and at the same time have the ability to take up a grassroots fight against those entrenched in these constituencies? It’s a tough ask, but it’s time that he started working on the contours and come out with the names of the candidates who can build on his persona. So, why did he approach the Congress and not a regional party? There are a dime a dozen in Tamil Nadu including that of fellow actor-turned-politician Vijayakanth – but they may not be potential allies. This is because Kamal’s politics revolves around his persona and hence there is no space for any other leader, only followers. It would be difficult for any credible political leader to accept such an alliance where they abdicate their political leadership and play second fiddle to the star. This is why the second gift Kamal Haasan needs – and this one only he can give himself – is to create an image that he can carry allies along. Ideologically, Kamal Haasan’s politics has been consistent with the left, but even the left leadership is not convinced that it can electorally ally with him. The DMK has become a powerful pole for the anti-Modi political forces in the state and Kamal Haasan, at the moment, does not seem to have the ability to woo such forces to form an alliance with him. Even here, the votes his party would poll in the by election to the 20 seats, if and when it happens, will determine if political players are willing to ally with him or not. Nevertheless, alliances are the second political gift he needs to move forward. Finally, he may need to have a gift-return gift understanding with superstar Rajinikanth. As actors, they have both claimed to be friends, but can they have a friendship as politicians? They may have ideological and personality differences, but they both claim to represent a change in political culture and seek an overthrow of conventional politics. This means they will both be fighting for the same section of the electorate that is tired of the political situation and culture. So, Kamal Haasan may need to give or take three gifts – one from the people, one from the politicians and one from a fellow star-turned-politician – to march on as a just-born politician on his 64th birthday!

Jill Colvin Jonathan Lemire Zeke Miller,"Rejecting any hint of a setback, President Donald Trump on Wednesday, 7 November mocked members of his own party who were defeated in the midterm elections after distancing themselves from him and suggested that the Republicans’ loss of a House majority could turn out to be “extremely good” for him politically. Trump dissected the elections in a combative White House news conference that stretched to nearly 90 minutes as he put a defiantly glossy sheen on the mixed midterm results and stressed his party’s victories in the Senate. “I thought it was very close to complete victory,” Trump said, adding that he would “almost have to think about” whether he would have preferred Republicans to retain a slim majority in the House instead of their outright loss. Candidates who embraced his message “excelled,” and those who didn't faltered, the president added, ticking off a selective list of defeated Republicans to support his point. The president's post-election readout showed his determination to put a positive spin on midterms that will bring an end to GOP control of Congress and open him to Democratic-led investigations in the House. And it made clear the extent to which Trump has remade his party to his own specifications, as he suggested that those who survived were indebted to him, a president who prizes loyalty above all else. The results, Trump argued, were proof of his ability to turn out voters. But his message also appeared to alienate well-educated voters — especially women — in the suburbs. Between his sharp jabs at the press, Trump took credit for Republican wins in the Senate, claiming his “vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave” that never fully materialise. He was quick to distance himself from losing GOP House members who had been critical of his heated rhetoric, citing Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, among others. ""Too bad, Mike,"" Trump said of Coffman, before turning on Utah's Mia Love, whose race remained too close to call. ""Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,"" Trump said. Trump's claim that those who backed him were successful was not without exceptions. Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, for example was defeated although he had embraced Trump, with both highlighting their desire to get more of the president's judicial nominees confirmed, a top priority for many social conservatives. The president also suggested that, somehow, losing a House majority could be beneficial to his agenda because Democrats will want to work with him. “I can see it being extremely good politically,” he said. The president’s rebuke was felt on Capitol Hill. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania who announced his retirement earlier this year, tweeted his displeasure: Trump, who had spent months demonising Democrats as lawless ""mobs"" and telling his rally crowds that their ascendancy would tank the economy and plunge the nation into crime-ridden chaos, said on Wednesday it was time for bipartisan co-operation. He claimed that Democrats — who made opposing him a centrepiece to their campaign — would, in fact, be eager to work with him on issues like infrastructure. But the olive branch he extended was studded with thorns as he declared that he would retaliate if Democrats use their control of the House to issue subpoenas to seek his tax returns and investigate his business dealings, his Cabinet's conduct and his campaign's ties to Russia, as expected. ""They can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate,"" Trump said. ""If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing and government would come to a halt and we're going to blame them."" The White House news conference was punctuated by Trump's escalating attacks on the media. The president repeatedly flashed his temper as he insulted several reporters by name, interrupted their questions, ordered some to sit down and deemed one inquiry about his embrace of the description ""nationalist"" to be ""racist."" His back-and-forth with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over Trump's hard-line immigration rhetoric grew especially heated, with Trump labelling the reporter a ""very rude person"" and saying the outlet ""should be ashamed of itself"" for employing him. Trump, as he did throughout the campaign, also blamed the media for sowing division in the country and insisted they were to blame for the scene unfolding in the East Room. ""I come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions and I have people jumping out of their seats shouting questions at me,"" he complained. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Michael Balsamo,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out on Wednesday, 7 November, after enduring more than a year of blistering and personal attacks from President Donald Trump, who inserted in his place a Republican Party loyalist with authority to oversee the remainder of the special counsel's Russia investigation. The move has potentially ominous implications for special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe given that the new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, until now Sessions’ chief of staff, has questioned the inquiry’s scope and spoke publicly before joining the Justice Department about ways an attorney general could theoretically stymie the investigation. Congressional Democrats, concerned about protecting Mueller, called on Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation in its final but potentially explosive stages. That duty has belonged to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and closely monitors his work. The resignation, in a one-page letter to Trump, came one day after Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives and was the first of several expected post-midterms Cabinet and White House departures. Though Sessions was an early and prominent campaign backer of Trump, his departure letter lacked effusive praise for the president and made clear the resignation came ""at your request."" The departure was the culmination of a toxic relationship that frayed just weeks into Sessions' tenure, when he stepped aside from the Russia investigation because of his campaign advocacy and following the revelation that he had met twice in 2016 with the Russian ambassador to the US. The investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and guilty pleas from four former Trump aides. But the work is not done and critical decisions await that could shape the remainder of Trump's presidency. Mueller’s grand jury, for instance, has heard testimony for months about Trump confidant Roger Stone and what advance knowledge he may have had about Russian hacking of Democratic emails. Mueller's team has also been pressing for an interview with Trump. And the department is expected at some point to receive a confidential report of Mueller's findings, though it's unclear how much will be public. Separately, Justice Department prosecutors in New York secured a guilty plea from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who said the president directed him to arrange hush-money payments before the 2016 election to two women who said they had sex with Trump. The president deflected questions about Sessions' expected departure at a White House news conference on Wednesday. He did not mention that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had called Sessions beforehand to ask for his resignation. The undated letter was then sent to the White House. The Justice Department did not directly answer whether Whitaker would assume control of Mueller's investigation, with spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores saying he would be ""in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice."" Rosenstein remains at the department and could still be involved in oversight. He has previously said that he saw no basis for firing Mueller. Trump said on Wednesday that he did not plan to stop the investigation. Without Sessions’ campaign or Russia entanglements, there's no legal reason Whitaker couldn't immediately oversee the probe. And since Sessions technically resigned instead of forcing the White House to fire him, he opened the door under federal law to allowing the president to choose his successor instead of simply elevating Rosenstein, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. That left Whitaker in charge, at least for now, though Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, said he should recuse himself because of his comments on the probe. Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he wants ""answers immediately"" and ""we will hold people accountable."" Whitaker, a former US attorney from Iowa who twice ran unsuccessfully for statewide office and founded a law firm with other Republican Party activists, once opined about a scenario in which Trump could fire Sessions and then appoint an acting attorney general who could stifle the funding of Mueller's probe. In that scenario, Mueller's budget could be reduced ""so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,"" Whitaker said during an interview with CNN in July 2017 before he joined the Justice Department. In a CNN op-ed last year, Whitaker wrote, “Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.” Trump's relentless attacks on Sessions came even though the Alabama Republican was the first US senator to endorse Trump and despite the fact his crime-fighting agenda and priorities, particularly his hawkish immigration enforcement policies, largely mirrored the president’s. He found satisfaction in being able to reverse Obama-era policies that conservatives say flouted the will of Congress, encouraging prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges they could and promoting more aggressive enforcement of federal marijuana law. He also announced media leak crackdowns and tougher policies against opioids, and his Justice Department defended a since-abandoned administration policy that resulted in migrant parents being separated from their children at the border. Trump repeatedly lamented that he would have never selected Sessions if he had known the attorney general would recuse himself. The recusal left the investigation in the hands of Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller two months later after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. In piercing attacks, Trump called Sessions weak and beleaguered, complained that he wasn't more aggressively pursuing allegations of corruption against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and called it ""disgraceful"" that Sessions wasn't more serious in scrutinising the origins of the Russia investigation for possible law enforcement bias — even though the attorney general did ask the Justice Department's inspector general to examine those claims. The broadsides escalated in recent months, with Trump telling an interviewer that Sessions ""never had control"" of the Justice Department. Sessions endured most of the name-calling in silence, though he did issue two public statements defending the department, including one in which he said he would serve “with integrity and honor” for as long as he was in the job. Sessions, who likely suspected his ouster was imminent, was spotted by reporters giving some of his grandchildren a tour of the White House over the weekend. He did not respond when asked why he was there. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Vivek Kaul,"The second anniversary of demonetisation is upon us. The best analysis of events like demonetisation happens in the years to come. By that time there is more data available. In the press release dated 8 November 2016, and accompanying the decision to demonetise high denomination notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, it was stated: “ .” After stating this, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdraw, and new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes were introduced. If it was easy to store black money in the form of Rs 1,000 notes, Rs 2,000 notes made it even more easier. In fact, the mandate of demonetisation was expanded in the ‘ ’ address that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave to the nation on 27 November 2016, where he said: What does Figure 1 tell us? The currency in circulation as of 4 November 2016,   demonetisation was Rs 17.98 lakh crore. After demonetisation, as people started depositing the demonetised notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 into their bank accounts, the currency in circulation started to fall. It fell to a low of Rs 8.98 lakh crore as of 6 January 2017. It has largely been rising since then. Of course, between then and now, the Indian economy has also grown, and we need to take that into account as well. The trouble is that, while the data on the currency in circulation comes out every week, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Indian economy (or the size of the economy), is declared only once every three months. What does Figure 2 tell us? It tells that between June 2012 and September 2016, the currency to GDP ratio varied between 11 percent and a little over 12 percent. Basically, looking at Figure 1, it is safe to say that the currency to GDP ratio of India, at most points of time, has been around 12 percent. In the aftermath of demonetisation, it fell to 6.35 percent of the GDP as of end December 2016. It has been rising since then and as of the end of June 2018, stood at 11.30 percent. The ratio has constantly been rising since December 2016. Given that the GDP data is currently available only up to June, 2018, the currency to GDP ratio can be calculated only up until then. Also, as cash (or currency) has made its way back into the system, the economic growth which had fallen dramatically (especially of the non-government part of the economy) in the aftermath of demonetisation, has recovered. In the aftermath of demonetisation, as cash was taken out of the system, economic transactions collapsed. Let’s look at some data to understand this very important point. Let’s take the case of Nigeria, which had a currency to GDP ratio of 1.85 percent in 2016. It is by far a more corrupt country than India is, though it has significantly  than India does, given its economic size. Or take the case of Brazil which had a currency to GDP ratio of 3.31 percent in 2016. It’s a country more or less  as India is. Or take the cases of Singapore, the Eurozone, Taiwan, Switzerland and Japan, with a currency to GDP ratio of 10.36 percent, 10.49 percent, 10.54 percent, 11.11 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively. Each of these areas or countries had a currency to GDP ratio higher that of India in 2016. But none of these areas or countries is as corrupt as India is. This notion that a higher currency in circulation leads to more corruption and black money, is indeed a misleading one. Global data shows that to us, very clearly. If there should be one learning from demonetisation two years on, this has to be it — more cash or more currency in the system — doesn’t necessarily mean more corruption or more black money. The problem clearly lies elsewhere.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"In an emphatic endorsement of Karnataka's ruling JD(S)-Congress coalition by the voters, its candidates on Tuesday, 6 November, won both the assembly constituencies and also clinched two of the three Lok Sabha seats in the bitterly fought by-polls held on Saturday, 2 November. The by-elections came as a major setback for the main opposition BJP ahead of the 2019 elections with the party set to lose the Ballari Lok Sabha seat, considered a stronghold of the controversial mining barons – the Reddy brothers. VS Ugrappa of the Congress has established a lead of more than 2.14 lakh votes in Ballari over BJP's J Shantha, the sister of B Sriramulu, a key aide of the Reddys and the former MP from there. Madhu is the son of former Congress chief minister, the late S Bangarappa. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha bagged the Ramanagara assembly seat by a spectacular margin of 1,09,137 against her nearest rival BJP's L Chandrashekar, who had pulled out of the contest but still officially remains the party candidate. Chandrashekar, who had joined the BJP ahead of the polls returned to Congress weeks later, leaving the saffron party red-faced and the field open for a walkover by Anitha Kumaraswamy. Ramanagara seat fell vacant after Kumaraswamy preferred to retain Channapatna, the other constituency from where he had won. With Tuesday, 6 November’s victory, the Congress-JD(S) alliance's tally will go up to 120 seats in the 224 member assembly where the BJP has 104 MLAs. In Mandya Lok Sabha constituency, JD(S) candidate LR Shivarame Gowda has established a lead of a staggering 3.24 lakh votes over BJP candidate Siddaramaiah, a political green horn and a former civil servant. Mandya is a stronghold of the Vokkaliga community to which JD(S) supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda belongs. Elated over the performance of the ruling alliance candidates, jubilant Congress workers distributed sweets and broke coconuts at various places. Karnataka Congress President Dinesh Gundu Rao claimed the results reflected the disenchantment of people with the BJP. Karnataka is the only south Indian state where the BJP has been in power. The by-elections for three Lok Sabha seats were necessitated after Yeddyurappa and Sriramulu of the BJP and CS Puttaraju of the JD(S) vacated Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya following their election to the assembly in May. By-polls to the Jamakhandi seat was necessitated following the death of sitting Congress MLA Siddu B Nyamagouda, while Ramanagara fell vacant after Kumaraswamy gave it up.

T M Veeraraghav,"The by-elections to two assembly and three parliamentary seats in Karnataka, in which the Congress-JD(S) alliance won four out of five seats, was not a referendum on the checkered tenure of the coalition state government headed by HD Kumaraswamy, but a test of the electoral arithmetic of the Congress – JD(S) alliance. The polls never threatened the survival of the coalition government which has a majority in the assembly. Now, to understand how the arithmetic has played out, each of the three parliamentary bypoll result needs to be seen independently, as the three seats represent different regions of the state of Karnataka. The result in Ballari, which falls in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region of the state where the Congress and BJP fight a head-on battle, is a body blow to the BJP and B Sriramulu, who is the face of the notorious Reddy brothers. Sriramulu had won this seat in 2014 by a margin of less than 10 percent votes. The Congress polled 42.96 percent votes and the JD(S) had just 1.21 percent. In 2018, Sriramulu’s sister J Shantha was the BJP candidate, and the coalition fielded veteran Congress MLC VS Ugrappa who has emerged the big winner. It’s not just a defeat for Sriramulu and the BJP, but one by a huge margin by over 2 Lakh votes. In fact, state minister DK Shivakumar, known for his money power and ability for grassroots electoral management, camped in Ballari throughout the campaign. This is a big win for him and his party. The region has 6 parliamentary seats and this result will bolster the confidence for the alliance. Most likely all the seats here will be given to Congress candidates in 2019 as the JD(S) is only a distant third player here, and this is an area the party might be keen on consolidating. The lesson from the results here is that in any region where it is a neck-to-neck battle between the Congress and the BJP, the JD(S) alliance shifts the scale decisively in favour of the Congress. Shimoga is a BJP bastion and home turf of B S Yeddyurappa; a seat he won in the 2014 parliamentary polls by a margin of over 30 percent. Yeddyurappa polled 53.69 percent of the votes in 2014 and the Congress and JD(S) candidates polled only 21 odd percent votes each. In 2018, the coalition candidate Madhu Bangarappa, fighting on a JD(S) ticket, lost by a margin of around 47,000 votes. Yeddyurappa’s son BY Raghavendra may have scraped through, but it’s clear that the BJP can no longer sit comfortably even in its most secure seats. In the end, Yeddyurappa’s son managed to survive, but the margin of victory is an injury. In places like Shimoga and Coastal Karnataka, the BJP has traditionally won huge, and this had meant that the party could focus its resources in other parts of the state. But if the Congress- JD(S) alliance can give it a tough fight even in these regions, then the BJP could be tied down. This is the case in around 8 to 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state. This is the heart of the Old Mysore region and the Cauvery belt. It has been a traditional JD(S) Vokkaliga caste-based bastion and the fight here is usually a straight   battle. This is why there was serious in-fighting and friction, when the Congress gave the seat to the JD(S) which fielded Shivarame Gowda. In 2014, the Congress lost this seat to the JD(S) by a wafer-thin margin of less than 0.5 percent votes. The Congress candidate and party social media icon Divya Spandana polled 43.5 percent against the JDS candidate’s 43.97 percent. In effect, the results here never really mattered. It was obvious that the alliance candidate would win as the BJP has only a marginal presence. As expected, Shivarame Gowda has won with a massive margin. It cannot afford to give too many such seats away to the JD(S) in the parliamentary election, and this is a major challenge. In fact, some observers feel that the decision to give the Mandya seat to the JD(S) opens the doors for the BJP in the Old Mysore region. This is a long-term problem for the Congress. The JD(S) has its base amongst the Vokkaliga caste here, but the Congress base is a combination of castes opposed to the Vokkaliga domination, apart from having its own Vokkaliga leadership. Abandoning these seats to the JD(S), especially a seat like Mandya, could mean a backlash from other castes and that is dangerous for the party. Seatsharing with the JD(S) will be a major challenge in this region as the JD(S) would want a lion’s share here. As expected, the alliance has won comfortably in both Ramanagara and Jamkhandi. In Ramanagara assembly seat, Anita Kumaraswamy, wife of the chief minister, had a cake walk after the BJP candidate L Chandrashekar publicly withdrew from the contest at the last minute. In Jamkhandi seat, it was expected that Congress candidate Anand Nyamagowda, son of late MLA Siddu B Nyamagowda is leading comfortably. This was also expected as he had a sympathy factor going in his favour after his father died in a road accident.         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty,"In a double whammy, Bangladesh’s High Court has dealt another grievous blow to Begum Khaleda Zia, former prime minister and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the major opposition party. The court enhanced her sentence in a corruption case from 5 to 10 years. This comes at a time when Bangladesh is on the cusp of announcing the schedule for the general elections. Tarique and several opposition members were convicted in the grenade attack case of 2004, in which Sheikh Hasina was injured and several Awami League [AL] leaders and workers were killed. Tarique got life imprisonment, and 19 others who were accused, got the death penalty. A fugitive from justice, Tarique has been in exile in London since 2009. These convictions may well pave the way for Bangladesh having its next general elections without Begum Zia, unless she manages to obtain a suspension of her sentence or it is set aside by a higher court. Such allegations are par for the course in Bangladesh, but it is noteworthy that these cases were launched by the erstwhile Army-backed caretaker government in 2007 and   by the Bangladesh Awami League (AL) government which came to power in 2008. Both the law minister and Attorney General of Bangladesh have publicly stated that even if Begum Zia gets her sentence suspended by a higher court, she will be ineligible to stand for election. Dr Hossain had a bitter parting with the AL over his ambition to take over its leadership. Faced with disarray in its ranks and boycotting elections no longer a viable option, the BNP has joined the new Front. The Front has already run into bad weather, marred by ideological and ego clashes. Former President Dr Badruddoza Chowdhury of   has walked out of the Front, creating a rift that certainly weakens the Front’s ability to challenge the ruling AL. He is now leading another coalition called the  . Dr Badruddoza is founder member of the BNP and he too parted with the party on a bitter note when he was forced to resign by Tarique. He left the BNP and formed the  . The bone of contention leading to the rift, has been the role of the   [JeI], the notorious Islamist Party, with a documented history of collaboration with Pakistan and committing genocide in Bangladesh’s bloody War of Liberation in 1971. Dr Chowdhury insisted that the BNP discard its Islamist allies and join the Front. The JeI has been weakened considerably with the execution of its leaders for war crimes. While lying low, it has adopted tactics like infiltrating into other parties, including the AL. Both Fronts have called for dialogue with the government. PM Hasina, after rejecting earlier calls for dialogue, has done a   and agreed to meet both the Front’s leaders – a smart change of strategy. The   Front’s leaders who will participate in the dialogue, will include senior BNP leaders, some of whom are opposed to Tarique Rahman’s leadership – who they allege is primarily responsible for the problems faced by the BNP. Dialogue with AL is sure to drive a wedge between Tarique and senior BNP leaders, and make AL look reasonable. The AL government is unlikely to accept the list of demands that will, no doubt, be presented by the Front for a free and fair election. A sure sticking point will be the demand that Begum Zia be freed and allowed to participate in the election. The AL government will definitely take the position that it is for the courts to decide Begum Zia’s fate. This issue might be another point of friction between the BNP and other parties in the   Front. Bangladesh’s economy has done exceedingly well, emerging as one of the fastest growing economies in the last quarter, surging ahead of India. The credit for this achievement goes to the policies of PM Hasina’s government. Her handling of the Rohingya migration issue has also earned her full marks globally. The new political players in the form of the coalition Fronts are not likely to pose a huge challenge but can emerge as a viable, albeit a weak opposition. For the ruling AL, anti-incumbency and problems within its ranks are serious challenges. Till the 2014 elections, voters have elected either the AL or the BNP to power. The AL has become a fractious organisation and corruption has been eating into its vitals. Sheikh Hasina’s dalliance with and appeasement of some Islamist organisations has also offended many AL voters. A major purge of corrupt and communal elements in her own party is the need of the hour. PM Sheikh Hasina must be fully  with these challenges which if not tackled head on, can dent the AL’s vote bank in the forthcoming elections. ( ,      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

PTI,"RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav, who met his father Lalu Prasad in Ranchi on Saturday, 3 November, regarding his decision to divorce his wife, did not return to Patna as expected but left mid-way for an unknown destination, sources close to the family said on Tuesday, 6 November. Yadav had met his father for a couple of hours on Saturday at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in Ranchi, where the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo is lodged in custody in connection with a fodder scam case, and checked in at a Bodh Gaya hotel on Sunday night, local MLA Kumar Sarvjeet said. He left the hotel on Monday afternoon, saying he was going to Patna, Sarvjeet added. The mercurial elder son of Prasad and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, however, was yet to reach Patna, his family sources said. Yadav had told reporters after meeting Prasad that he stood by his decision to give divorce to his wife of six months, Aishwarya Rai. Yadav is said to be fond of visiting places of pilgrimage like Vrindavan and Varanasi for spiritual solace, and one of his grouses against his wife is that she has not been able to adjust to his way of life. Yadav, a former Bihar health minister, had recently spent a number of days in Vrindavan, where he was reportedly seen playing a flute with a peacock feather tied to his head in the midst of a herd of cows. Neither Aishwarya, who is the daughter of RJD MLA Chandrika Rai and granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai, nor any member of her family, have spoken on the matter so far. She had tied the knot with Yadav on 12 May and the RJD leader had moved an application seeking divorce on 2 November, citing incompatibility. Prasad, who is serving sentences in fodder scam cases, had flown in from Ranchi after obtaining parole from a court to attend Yadav's wedding, which was attended by the leaders of virtually all the political parties, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan.

The Quint,"As the death of tigress Avni in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district last week continues to create a furore, Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has sought to counter the allegations made by Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, who has called the tigress’ death “nothing but a straight case of crime”. In an interview with  , Mungantiwar pointed out that with regard to the incident, all procedures were legally carried out as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NCTA) guidelines. The 'man-eating' tigress, Avni, (officially known as T1), said to be responsible for 14 deaths in Maharashtra's Yavatmal, was shot dead on the night 2 November after a massive operation spanning two months. Following reports of the tigress's death, Maneka Gandhi lashed out at the forest minister, saying that the shooter Asgar Ali “illegally” murdered the tigress. Refuting Gandhi’s claims, Mungantiwar said the shooter Asgar Ali, son of well-known shooter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, was authorised to be on the team carrying out the operation. Mungantiwar said the entire team was present on the night of the incident, indicating that the veterinary doctor was also present. He also added that Gandhi, who criticised his department on social media, did so without having full knowledge of the matter. Meanwhile, the shooter Asgar Ali maintained that he shot the tigress in self-defence and denied the “trigger-happy allegations” levelled against him. He maintained that efforts were made to capture and save the tigress over a period of two years, adding that this time around too, the team tried its best to capture the animal alive. Earlier,   to The News Minute, Asgar Ali had expressed sadness over the killing, saying, “What kind of satisfaction can one get by killing the national animal?” After her her tweets, Maneka Gandhi also asked Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis to “remove” state forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar from his post, calling him a “liability” and accusing him of issuing orders to shoot tigress T1 in Pandharkawada, allegedly without any effort to tranquilise her,  reported on Tuesday. Gandhi also said a petition is being readied to be presented in court against T1’s “murder”. News18 reported that Maneka wrote another letter to Fadnavis, reiterating her demand of removing Mungantiwar. Responding to Gandhi’s reported demand, Mungantiwar told the channel, “I will resign if what I am saying about the SC order is wrong. Else she (Maneka Gandhi) should resign.” Earlier on Monday, when asked about Union Minister Maneka Gandhi's statements on the tigress' killing, Fadnavis said the former had used ""harsh words"". In a series of tweets on Sunday, Gandhi had said, ""It is nothing but a straight case of crime. Despite several requests from many stakeholders, (Sudhir) Mungantiwar, minister for forests, Maharashtra, gave orders for the killing."" Fadnavis had said, ""She (Maneka) has used harsh words. But her sentiments should be understood. All animal lovers' sentiments are harsh regarding this incident. It was a difficult decision. Whether the procedure was correct or not will be checked."" Devendra Fadnavis had also said on Monday that the killing of Avni was a sad incident and any procedural lapse in it would be probed. Speaking to reporters, he said, “There is no happiness over the killing. The forest department took the decision since she had killed 13 to 14 people. There are some doubts regarding whether the tigress was first shot and then the dart inserted, this aspect will be probed.” ""We speak of increasing tiger population and conserving wildlife, and then unfortunately such a decision had to be taken. The tiger is a gentleman. He attacks only if his habitat is violated. Preliminary reports with me say the tigress attacked the forest department team and she was shot in self-defence,"" the Maharashtra CM said. ""Hunter Asgar Ali was hired by the forest department. The doubts raised regarding the killing will be verified,"" he added. Rahul Gandhi also tweeted against the killing of the tigress, which prompted a strong reaction from Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan. Vardhan hit back at the Congress president, saying no previous government has worked with the kind of “depth and seriousness” this dispensation has. The government does not need a certificate from Rahul Gandhi, Vardhan said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Rajan Mahan,"Manvendra Singh’s recent switch to the Congress marks the climax to a long-running cold war in the Rajasthan BJP. The marquee clash of Rajasthan politics – with Vasundhara Raje on one side and the Jaswant Singh family on the other – seems more like a medieval, feudal battle than a modern political tussle. The personal and the political are so intimately linked in this (“fight for honour”) that for years, most people did not even know that the feuding families were at war. Yet, in this clash of ego, pride and politics between a powerful Maharani (Raje) and a spirited Thakur clan (Jaswant and family), both sides would rather break than bend! But why did two of Rajasthan’s tallest BJP leaders turn into foes? For this, one needs to trace the roots of the alienation that bred a sense of betrayal, and ultimately led to a parting of ways well before Manvendra uttered his now famous farewell slogan –  – ‘Going with BJP’s lotus symbol was our mistake’. A brief look at the history of this break-up is instructive and full of irony. For political observers, Raje touching Jaswant’s feet in Jaipur in December 2003 was a recognition of Jaswant Singh’s role in mentoring her to become the first woman chief minister of Rajasthan. Just as he got Raje inducted as his deputy in the Ministry of External Affairs through his closeness to PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jaswant, along with Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, got Raje into the politics of the desert state. The friendship, however, was short-lived. Soon after BJP lost the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Raje began ignoring the former finance minister since she felt Jaswant was a threat to her chair. With her own band of loyalists, Raje made it apparent that like the Congress ‘Old Guards’ had mistaken Indira Gandhi as a  or a ‘Dumb Doll’ in the mid- 1960s, the BJP seniors too had under-estimated her political prowess! Initially veiled by civility, the Raje-Jaswant cold war soon led to ludicrous attempts to embarrass each other. It started in 2006 when Raje loyalists dubbed a member of a Jaswant Singh-led delegation to Pakistan as a history sheeter involved in anti-national activities. For Jaswant, the army man-turned-politician, this was a below-the-belt attack to ‘insult’ his patriotism. The growing bitterness led to an open war in the summer of 2007 when Vasundhara loyalists issued a poster depicting Raje as a Goddess and claiming that this was an ‘insult’ to her religious sentiments, Jaswant’s wife Sheetal Kumari dragged the matter to court! As Vasundhara critics started rallying around Jaswant, a celebration at his home town Jasol in October 2007 gave the Raje camp a chance to hit back. A local citizen, allegedly at Raje’s instigation, registered a police complaint against Jaswant Singh for serving opium to his guests. Though a truce was reportedly brokered through LK Advani’s intervention, the bitterness had now turned into an open, irrevocable battle. Given this tussle, Jaswant and Manvendra sat supinely as Vasundhara was defeated in the 2008 Assembly elections. In return, Raje too did not campaign for Manvendra in the Lok Sabha elections of 2009, which led to him losing his MP seat of Barmer. With both stalwarts out of power, the rift receded for a few years and they even tried burying the hatchet by touring Barmer district together in 2012. However, after the BJP won the Rajasthan elections in 2013, when Raje ignored Manvendra’s claims for inclusion in the state Cabinet, the ego-battle and political rivalry resurfaced with greater ferocity. The final rupture came when instead of accommodating Jaswant’s claims, the BJP, under Raje’s pressure, gave the Barmer ticket in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to Congress defector Colonel Sona Ram; an insult that made the veteran openly accuse Raje of betraying not just him “but the principles of BJP as well as its workers”. Though Jaswant’s humiliation is cited as Raje’s betrayal of the Rajputs, the community is currently upset with the Raje government for a variety of reasons ranging from the mishandling of the   film controversy, to the encounter-killing of a local Rajput strongman Anandpal, as well as the recent sidelining of Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in the race to be the state BJP President due to Raje’s opposition. With Jaswant Singh in coma for over four years, Manvendra termed his resignation as an issue of   (self-respect) for Rajput pride and honour. It is this Rajput goodwill that Manvendra hopes to carry into the Congress and help it win more Rajput votes. Whether that will come true or not remains uncertain. But it’s undeniable that though Rajputs comprise only 7 percent of the state’s population, their influence in electoral politics extends far beyond their numbers and experts say they impact about 50 of the 200 Vidhan Sabha seats in Rajasthan. As such, if Manvendra’s call for self-respect strikes a strong chord with the honour-bound Rajput community, Vasundhara Raje may find an ailing Jaswant Singh far tougher to handle than the healthy Thakur she outwitted in 2014!

Manish Dubey,"At a time when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s party and government are at loggerheads with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Supreme Court – and stand accused of meddling in the affairs of India’s premier investigative agency (CBI) – it is unsurprising that he touched upon the subject of ‘separation of powers’ during the AB Vajpayee Memorial Lecture recently. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), and at least one academic of note, has endorsed Jaitley’s line since. In all fairness, the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government is neither the first to be accused of overreach and nor is Jaitley the first politician to grumble about the so-called tyranny of the un-elected. “Why should those who do not submit to popular will, dictate terms to those of us who are judged every five years in the court of the people” – parties and politicians have routinely argued, when under fire for overstepping jurisdictional boundaries. Therefore, the latter party have little or no   when it comes to interrogating the elected, on issues of public import – is questionable though. The ubiquity and persistence of the argument also means that it needs to be examined without training the lens on a specific party. For starters, not every flash-point between various branches of government signals an ego-driven turf war. The tensions also owe to challenges in anticipating the range of real-life situations and conflicts. This, especially at a time when ideas and technologies are rapidly reshaping the terms of engagement in almost every field of human endeavor. In other words, the doctrine of separation of power, while intended to keep institutions on their toes, can also see toes getting stepped on. Sometimes on account of narrow considerations, sometimes because laws and rules cannot practically codify responses to every constellation of circumstances. The recent flash-points in India reflect the two aetiologies, notwithstanding common concerns around corruption, and the emergence of an omnipresent, omnipotent state lacing them. While those over fundamentals like privacy, human rights and free speech are aimed at countering a mischievous reset of normals, a qualitatively different set of contests has emerged with private sector footprints in hitherto closed sectors, and increased awareness of the social and environmental costs of the dominant development paradigm. Reading every flash-point then, as a conspiracy to undermine the authority of the elected, may not be correct. In practice, choices before voters are hardly enviable and preferences expressed in voting booths are trade-offs between corruption and identitarian solidarity. More often than not then, the elected may be the more tolerable choice, far from the ideal one – that too of groups that are numerically influential at the constituency level. Expecting all those elected in such circumstances to remain accountable to their constituents is a stretch. On the contrary, given the unpredictable ways in which power games can pan out, there are tendencies to make hay while in power, play constituents against each other and undeservedly reward the faithful. Put together, these are a concoction of corruption, exclusion and divisiveness that Indians are no strangers to. It is in the interregnum between elections then, that the tyranny of the elected unfolds, and it is to check such tyranny that the executive and judiciary are constitutionally granted countervailing power vis-à-vis the elected. In a sense, it is protection – by design – against the fallibility of the elected. A ‘silent’, enduring settlement between the branches of government is neither possible nor desirable. For it can come only at the cost of a skewed power balance or inertia. The solution would be for both the elected and the non-elected to appreciate the value of listening to each other so that popular aspirations and issues receive the priority they must and responses to them tap into institutional memory and wisdom– without losing sight of constitutional imperatives. Negotiation is inevitable in the process, but how productive and smooth it is, will depend on the frames of mind of those at the table. Eschewing the contempt implicit in ‘non-accountable’ will make for a good start though.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Mayank Mishra,"When asked why BSP chief Mayawati seems non-committal on an alliance, a political expert told me:   (What’s the point of waking up after losing everything?) She carries the reputation of a strong leader, one who has the rare distinction of transferring votes to whichever party she allies with. Not many leaders can claim to have such a committed following. She is considered to be the most prominent Dalit leader and we all know that Dalit votes are significant enough to alter political equations in almost all Lok Sabha constituencies. It is, therefore, incumbent on Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party and the Congress to bring her on board. At least, so goes conventional wisdom. I had no clue why the expert had said that about Mayawati but I brushed it aside as a casual remark. That is, till I mapped the relevant data of the last five elections – three Assembly and two Lok Sabha – that have taken place in politically significant Uttar Pradesh. Since she has a strong base in Uttar Pradesh, her political stock is heavily dependent on how her party performs in the state. What comes across, loud and clear, is that she now presides over a party that is on a steep downward spiral. And, despite slogans like   (for the benefit of all), her attempts to expand her base beyond Dalits have been, at best, a work in progress. She runs the risk of getting marginalised if she ignores what is obvious and does not make the right choice. The BSP’s performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha and the 2017 Assembly elections has been pretty dismal. In the Parliamentary elections, her party had its worst performance in the last 25 years. What is worse, the BSP could establish a lead in a mere nine of the 403 Assembly segments – worse than the seemingly weak Congress, which had a lead in 15 segments. Three years later, in the 2017 Assembly elections, the BSP’s winning strike rate, at an abysmal five percent, was worse than the Congress’ six and SP’s 15. What is more, the vote share of BSP and the Congress, if adjusted to number of seats contested, was identical! We must, however, add here that the Congress had an alliance with SP in the elections. While the dismal performance of the BSP in 2014 was considered a one-off event, a repeat down the line was a vindication of the growing view that her party faces an existential crisis. So, what has changed? CSDS data offers some clues. Ever since its inception, the BSP has been receiving a fair amount of Dalit votes in the country. It secured nearly 18 percent of all Dalit votes in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and it peaked at 22 percent in 2004. But it fell sharply to just 14 percent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. That was the first clear indication that not all Dalits were voting for Mayawati. More specifically, in Uttar Pradesh, while the BSP secured 48 percent of all non-Jatav votes in the 2012 Assembly elections, it could secure only 30 percent of such votes two years later, in the General Elections. The party’s outreach programme has also failed to reap dividends, as it has been receiving less than 20 percent of votes from Muslims and people belonging to privileged castes. This suggests that while there is a constant erosion in Mayawati’s appeal amongst her core support group, consisting of Dalits, expected headway among others is yet to bear any fruit. It is, therefore, imperative that Mayawati redefines her politics. Coining new slogans does not seem to be working. Changing few office-bearers here and there has not helped either. What she needs the most is a set of allies who can take her message to the groups that have hitherto stayed away from her. It is alright to have tough posturing for a hard bargain when dealing with potential allies. But Mayawati should know that she cannot afford to miss the alliance bus now. The General Elections next year are going to be a crucial test of her political revival. There is a real possibility of making a mark if she rides the alliance bus. Or else, she runs the risk of getting marginalised. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Maanvi,"Mohd Irshad Alam What is the Kashmir conflict about? Is autonomy a feasible solution? How would an expert describe the current government's approach to Kashmir? With the release of her new book ‘Paradise At War’, Dr Radha Kumar, one of the three interlocutors appointed by the Centre to Kashmir in 2010, answers the questions we've all thought had about the Kashmir conflict. Is there a solution to the Kashmir conflict? For me, the solution was always that you take autonomy as your baseline. But time changes. What you could have done in the  60s, 70s or the 80s, you can’t now, because the situation has changed, the people have changed, and your government itself has changed. An example to think about this is, “When I have made people hate me so much, how do I say that we can find a solution between us?” That’s the real question, and I wish I had the answer, but I don’t. Is autonomy for Kashmir an option? When we say feasibility, the truth of the matter is that for the last 70 years, Kashmir has been between a rock and a hard place. Kashmir’s geopolitical situation is such that independence would never last; they would end up always having to be with India or with Pakistan. Obviously, as an Indian, I would prefer that Kashmir stays with India. But I keep coming back to that one moral question; if our government and our people feel that Kashmiris are not part of India — and that is the approach that we have seen in the past few years — then with what standing can they say that the future is only with us? How would you view this government’s approach to Kashmir? I think they have driven Kashmiris away from us in a way that hasn’t happened for the last 30 years. And what has happened in the last few years is such a departure from an earlier situation. One is at a loss, I don’t understand why an approach of saying that these people are terrorists, they are anti-nationals, irrationals. What do you think you can achieve when you have that approach? So, what should the government be doing? I think the steps are fairly well-known. You rein in your counter-insurgency alone approach. You start to put some security and safety measures on the ground. It sounds banal to say this, but you do have to have that healing touch and you have to adopt a series of measures to show that you have an intention to reform. What is the lesson on Kashmir that you wish subsequent governments would take? One, learn from the past 15 years, which is the period in which we have had some of the most sustained peacemaking initiatives. Learn from that, take the lessons from what former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee did and then learn what the successor government, the UPA, did. The problem is that if you discard everything that has been  done, I don’t see where you start, then. What’s India’s biggest asset when it comes to Kashmir? When I went in 2010, 120 people had died. There was huge anger in the streets and among the people of Kashmir and yet within two months, they began to come to us, and to think about how could they engage themselves in the peace process. That should be regarded by our government as an enormous asset. I don’t think I could ever have been that forgiving. But they won’t forget, but they would say, ‘I will take that extra step’. And to me, that extraordinary response, when you have been punished so much, to still be able to say, ‘I am coming back to the table, I am looking for a way out’. This should be taken by any government of ours as an enormous asset, and yet it isn’t. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The development comes days after he was dropped from Congress’s list of candidates for the poll-bound state. After the first list was released on October 24, people of Palak, Hiphei’s constituency, started objecting to his candidature and Congress decided not to take a chance,  reported quoting sources. Reportedly, Hiphei had a meeting with BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma last week. Incidentally, Sarma too, was a Congress MLA from Assam, before he shifted his loyalty to the saffron party in 2015. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Thursday, 1 November, replaced Hiphei with former legislator and party general secretary KT Rokhaw, while BJP now has Hiphei in its ranks. Mizoram remains the only north-east state, where the BJP is yet to penetrate significantly. In the 2013 assembly election, the party garnered a mere 0.4 per cent of the votes and failed to win a single seat.

Arun Dev,"The results of the by-elections held for the three Lok Sabha and two Assembly seats in Karnataka is set to be announced on Tuesday, 6 November. Although considered a precursor to the 2019 general elections, the significance of these bypolls boils down to who will win North Karnataka’s Ballari district – the district that came under the scanner for illegal mining, which played a crucial role in 2013 Karnataka elections. According to observers, while a BJP win in the Ballari would retain status quo and provide a moral boost for the party, it is a Congress win that is expected to create an impact to reckon with ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Out of the five constituencies going to polls, Mandya and Ramanagara – in the Old Mysore Region – are considered bastions of the Janata Dal Secular (JDS). As the BJP doesn’t have a strong base in this region, and the JD(S) is in an alliance with the Congress, the results in these seats are expected to go in JD(S)’s favour. The BJP candidate in Ramanagara withdrawing from the elections in the last minute has cemented JD(S)’s victory in the region. Similarly, in Shivamoga, the home turf of BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa, no upsets have been predicted. Yeddyurappa’s son BS Raghavendra is BJP’s candidate in Shivamoga and has already won a parliamentary election from the constituency in the past. This essentially brings the spotlight on the Jamkhandi Assembly constituency and Ballari Lok Sabha seat. A tough competition is expected in both constituencies, however, the high-profile politicians involved in the campaign in Ballari makes it a battle to watch out for. In 1999, Ballari – a mine-rich district in north Karnataka – was the arena for a political showdown between Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj. Gandhi won the elections that year, but over the next decade the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) managed to wrest power in the region. In 2018, Ballari is ground for another crucial fight. Two strongmen of the Congress and the BJP are going head on this by-election. DK Shivakumar, who played a key role in ensuring the BJP was not allowed to form a government in Karnataka, is the district in-charge minister for Ballari. For the BJP, B Sriramalu, one of the mining barons of Ballari and the party’s go-to man in north Karnataka, will be leading the charge. The Congress has fielded VS Ugrappa, an anti-mining activist and MLC, as their candidate in Ballari, while the BJP has fielded Sriramalu’s sister, J Shantha. However, the Congress made up for this by fielding its strong campaigners, including former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and JD(S) supremo HD Devegowda, in the constituency. As for the BJP, Shantha is considered a proxy for Sriramalu, and the party is hoping to cash in on his popularity in the region. During last week of August, a turf war between DK Shivakumar and two other Congress leaders had threatened to bring down the government. The Jarkiholi brothers – Ramesh and Satish – two senior Congress leaders from north Karnataka had threatened to rebel, accusing Shivakumar of attempting a political coup in north Karnataka. The brothers, who have control of the politics of the region, claimed Shivakumar tried to assert his influence in the districts in north Karnataka using proxies, even though he was not from the region. The conflict was resolved with the Congress high command promising to induct an MLA from Ballari to the Cabinet and to replace Shivakumar as the minister in-charge of Ballari. The election is crucial for Sriramalu as well. During the Assembly elections in May this year, even though the BJP had fared well in the state, the party had managed victory in only three seats out of nine in Ballari. For Sriramalu, BJP’s in-charge for Ballari, a victory is important to show the leadership that he was in control of the region. Sriramalu, who was pitched as the deputy chief minister candidate after the Assembly election, is hoping to keep his relevance in the party intact with a win in Ballari. In the Assembly elections, the Congress candidate Siddu Nyamagowda had won the seat with 32.13% vote in Jamkhandi. The BJP candidate finished close behind with 30.31% votes, but there was a catch. The BJP votes were spilt between the BJP candidate and the rebel from the party. Sangamesh Nirani, a BJP leader, had rebelled from the party after he was denied a ticket and had contested as an independent. Nirani had managed to win 15.96% of the votes. As the combined vote share of the BJP candidate and rebel was more than that of the Congress candidate, it is the said that the BJP stands a chance in the by-election. However, the by-election was necessitated with Nyamagowda’s death in a road accident and his son is now contesting for the seat. The Congress is now hoping to convert some of BJP votes, cashing in on the sympathy wave. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

KJM Varma,"China on Sunday, 4 November, said it supported Pakistan's ""quest for peace through dialogue"" to settle the outstanding disputes with India as it backed Islamabad's ""engagement"" with the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). A joint statement, issued in Beijing after Prime Minister Imran Khan's talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, said that China backed Pakistan's efforts to improve ties with India to settle ""outstanding disputes"", without directly mentioning the Kashmir issue. The ties between India and Pakistan had strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups in 2016 and India's surgical strikes inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In recent years, China has refrained from taking a public stance on the India-Pakistan ties, expressing hope for resolution of the disputes through dialogue. On the Kashmir issue, China's oft-repeated stand was that it should be resolved peacefully through dialogue. India too supports dialogue as the way to resolve the issues with Pakistan but maintains that the talks and terrorism cannot go together. For its part, Pakistan supported active participation of China at the platform of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Significantly, China tacitly expressed its backing for Pakistan’s efforts to secure the NSG membership. While India, which is backed by the US and a number of western countries, has garnered the support of a majority of the group's members, China has stuck to its stand that new members should sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), making India's entry difficult as the group is guided by the consensus principle. India is not a signatory to the NPT. China also heaped praise on Pakistan for its efforts to counter terrorism and said it recognised Islamabad's efforts in actively strengthening financial regulations to combat terrorism financing, and called on all relevant parties to view Pakistan's counter-terrorism efforts in an objective and fair manner. But at the same time China is pressing Pakistan to crack down on Uygur Islamic militants crossing in and out of the volatile Muslim-majority Xinjiang province bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. ""The Pakistani side reaffirmed its support to the Chinese side in safeguarding its sovereignty and security, and combating separatism, terrorism and extremism including East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM),"" the statement said. Both China and Pakistan agreed to further enhance cooperation against ""three evils' of extremism, terrorism and separatism"", the statement said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The News Minute,"In the event of the temple reopening for a day on a Monday, 5 November, the Sabarimala Karma Samiti, a group leading the protests against the entry of women into the temple, has drafted an open letter to all media houses requesting them to not depute women journalists to cover the protest. It argued that deploying women reporters, even if it is to do their jobs, would only “aggravate” the situation. The letter, signed by the General Convener of the samiti, SJR Kumar, has been directed to the managing editor, chief editor or editor of the media house. The letter reads: “Therefore, we humbly request you to take a sympathetic approach to the feelings and aspirations of crores of devotees and kindly refrain from deputing women journalists of the above-mentioned age group to Sabarimala,” the letter said. Accusing the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government (which has supported the SC verdict) of using brute force to hastily enforce the judgement before the top court can hear review and writ petitions on 13 November, the letter stated that the devotees are “left with no choice but to continue their peaceful agitations.” On 17 and 18 October, when the temple reopened for the first time since the judgement lifting the ban was passed, protests led by right-wing groups broke out in Sabarimala. Many men and women heckled, threatened and even beat up several women, both devotees and journalists, who had arrived at Pamba and Nilakkal. As for those women who attempted to go to the temple with police protection, too, were harassed, abused and targeted for attempting to do so. Their houses, too, were attacked. The government has recorded 536-plus cases and arrested 3,719 suspects for engaging in violent protests at Pamba and Nilakkal. Only 100 are still in jail while the rest have been remanded or have managed to get bail. The letter also read that the devotees from all denominations in Kerala, other states and even from abroad will stage a continuous and unabated “agitation” against the verdict, which, it claims, goes against the wishes of a large section of devotees.

Sinha also said that the verdict in cases like Section 377 and Sabarimala did not take that long, but the verdict on Ayodhya has been pending for decades. Reacting to Sinha’s tweets, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that such a move will show the country the Congress’ true face and the BJP doesn’t need certification from National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah whose “loyalties lie with Pakistan.” “Rakesh Sinha is such a leader who knows the cultural arrangements across the country.

He is going from temple to temple to become a Hindu. Then why is he quiet on Ram temple?

The demand for bringing an ordinance for early construction of Ram temple has intensified within the BJP and various Sangh Parivar outfits. RSS spokesperson Arun Kumar said the court should deliver an early verdict and the government should make a law to remove hurdles and give land for the temple if required. ""With this in view, the Supreme Court should make an early decision and if there are any difficulties, the government should make a law to remove all hurdles in the way of giving land for temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site,"" Kumar said.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government has full faith in the court and added that a lot of people in the country want the hearing on the issue to be completed soon. BJP leader Vinay Katiyar alleged the issue was being delayed ""under pressure"" from the Congress. ""The decision is being delayed under pressure from the Congress.

Aparna Yadav, daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, said that she trusts the Supreme Court but the temple should be built. Senior Congress Leader P Chidambaram had said on Monday, 29 October, that it was a familiar story every five years before the elections when the BJP tried to polarise the issue.

Madhav told news agency ANI: Union Minister PP Chaudhary also said that a law can be made so the Ram temple can be constructed. On Friday, 2 November, Joshi had said Hindus were feeling ""insulted"" by the Supreme Court's declaration that the Ayodhya issue is not a priority and insisted that an ordinance would be needed if all options run out. After a three-day RSS conclave in Maharashtra, its general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said the organisation ""will not hesitate to launch an agitation for Ram temple, if needed, but since the matter is in the Supreme Court, there are restrictions."" Addressing the media, Suresh Joshi, general secretary of RSS, said that the court needs to think over the delay in giving verdict on the Ayodhya title case dispute. “Some things need to be dealt with patiently. The government works in accordance with both courts and constitution. But I also request the courts to think over this. Demand for temple has been there. But the delay is only hurting sentiments,” said Joshi. RSS’ comments come in the backdrop of the 29 October order on the Ayodhya title suit case, which adjourned the matter until January. Joshi said that an ordinance for the matter should be brought in if need be. “Making laws, bringing ordinances is the government’s job. If there is no option left, an ordinance should be brought in,” he said. Asked if anything was discussed with Bharatiya janata Party President Amit Shah, who met with the rank and file of RSS on Friday morning, Joshi said that the issue was discussed but he cannot divulge any details. Joshi also said that if need be, the RSS will launch a 1992-like mass movement to push their demand. “Lord Ram is in everybody’s hearts but he manifests only via temples. We want the temple to be built. There are some hurdles in the way and we expect the court to understand Hindu sentiments,” said Joshi. Commenting on whether he would try to gather support from other parties for an ordinance, particularly the BJP and Shiv Sena, Joshi said that the RSS considers all those who are demanding the temple to be on its side. “BJP and Shiv Sena should speak for themselves. But all those who are pushing for it, we consider them to be on the same page. We expect them all to support us. As long as the court does not give its verdict, it'll be difficult for the government to decide on anything,” he said.

Reacting to the comments, the state BJP said TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu was the ""king of corruption"" and fears that his alleged corruption would be exposed now. However, Ramakrishnudu said the TDP's immediate duty is to save the country from the BJP. The veteran leader said everyone has a primary responsibility to protect the country, democracy and constitutional values in the prevailing situation. He lashed out at the opposition YSR Congress and Jana Sena, saying they hankered only for power and did not have any national responsibility. State BJP president Kanna Lakshminarayana said: ""N Chandrababu Naidu is the king of corruption and will stoop to any level. The man who passed a resolution in the NDA meeting in 2017, that Modi should become prime minister again, is now trying to portray the latter as a culprit.” ""All corrupt leaders have formed a group and Chandrababu hastily ran into it. But it will not be possible if they try to loot the country in the garb of politics,"" he said. Chandrababu was scared that his corrupt history would be exposed and hence befriended the Congress, he added. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Revati Laul,"It’s interesting that so much of the mainstream media’s coverage of the unveiling of the colossal Sardar Patel statue in Kevadiya in Gujarat, focused on aerial shots. How it looks from the sky. It’s exactly the politics this government is hoping to preserve as crucial assembly elections are upon us, and a national one in six months. Don’t look at what’s happening on the ground. You may find then that the most disturbing thing about this 182 metre statue is that it is meant to have no shadow. It shines so bright from the safe and comfortable distance of a drone or helicopter or a Google map shot, that you won’t see the distress of farmers and tribals from about seventy surrounding villages. People like Lakhanbhai from Musavadi gaon, for instance. He’s among thousands of bewildered farmers with a shrinking crop on account of little or no water in their area, within a radius of ten kilometres of the great and glorious Narmada river. Who saw how water from the dams – the Narmada and Garudeshwar – was apparently released in order for it to accumulate around the statue’s feet and make it look pretty. Where was this water when we needed it in a season of inadequate rain, they are asking. Some wrote letters in blood to Prime Minister Modi, ahead of the unveiling. Others protested by foregoing one meal. “We just wanted to forego a meal and gather together to share our woes.” And then he added, “But there were over 5,000 police personnel in the area. It was as if we’re stuck in some kind of border war or something.” By all accounts, the statue being sold to the people of India and the world, as the tallest statue and the biggest tourist attraction, sits in a bed where the local residents seem unimpressed. In fact some are angry enough to say this will reflect in the way they vote in the general elections next year. A campaign clad in iron that drew its sustenance from the legacy of Sardar Patel – the man who brought 565 princely states into the Indian Union. In commissioning the tallest statue in the world of such a tall leader, Modi meant for it to herald a new era of big change. Now, farmers in Gujarat, living along the banks of the fast-disappearing Narmada point out, ‘it’s PR that has gone from solid metal to bronze clad to empty promises, gathering rust’. He built India then as Modi will, now. Sans the Congress. Never mind the truth, the campaign seemed to work. And now the deliverance of the statue is timed perfectly with the next elections in mind. Except, the patina seems to be wearing off. In 2014, the Sardar Patel statue commission was used to drive a massive  campaign – volunteers and cadre from the Sangh Parivar were asked to go from farmer to farmer across the country, asking them to donate their old farming implements, so the iron could be used to build the statue of the iron man. Commissioned by India’s new ‘iron man’, the new avatar of the oldest, tallest leader, resurrecting a new, non-Congress era. The   only talks of its bronze cladding and says nothing about the use of the farmers’ iron. And it isn’t clear if the website is a government-owned site. So, this reporter contacted one of the senior-most ministers in the Gujarat government, the Energy Minister Saurabh Patel. She asked, “Sir, what happened to all the   collected for the building of the Statue of Unity?” Experts in the building business claim it is very hard to imagine how old iron and steel, even if smelted and treated can have been used in the foundation at all. Especially since it would probably be a deep raft foundation, built with very high-grade steel and an enormous amount of concrete to support a statue of such staggering proportions. Would the Sardar have approved, protesting farmers and tribals in Gujarat have been asking. Watching in the wings is BSP leader Mayawati, as the BJP does what she once did in 2007 and they tore into her flesh for it. So much money on statues of Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati, the BJP said at the time. What a waste, when farmers in Uttar Pradesh, are starving. Now, they’re busy shining this ginormous piece of metal so that all its shadows are erased. Look…they’re gone! Shadows made to vanish, from fear and desperation some say. (Beware the wrath of the biggest, tallest, strongest!). Others point out, in the   game, where are the alternatives? ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

PTI,"Union Minister Uma Bharti on Sunday, 4 November, said while Hindus were the ""most tolerant"" people in the world, any talk of constructing a mosque on the periphery of a Ram temple in Ayodhya could make them ""intolerant"". ""Hindus are the most tolerant community in the world. I will appeal to all politicians: please don't make Hindus intolerant by talking about building a mosque on the outer periphery of the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya,"" Bharti told PTI. She said when there could not be a temple in the holy town of Medina or a mosque in the Vatican City, it would be ""unfair"" to talk about a mosque in Ayodhya. Describing the Ayodhya dispute as one of land and not faith, the firebrand Hindu leader said, ""This is now only a matter of dispute of land, not dispute of faith. It has been resolved that Ayodhya is the birth place of Lord Ram."" She also stressed the need for an out-of-court settlement of the contentious issue, and urged all political leaders – including Gandhi, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, BSP leader Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee – to support this. ""We need support of all political parties on this issue. I invite all leaders including, Rahul Gandhiji, come let's lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple with me,"" Bharti said. By doing so, the Gandhi-scion could atone for the past sins of the Congress, which always created ""hurdles"" in building the temple in Ayodhya, she said. SP supremo Mulayam Singh, Banerjee, Mayawati and the Left parties should support the BJP on this issue as it is of national interest, she said. ""But they aren't letting the matter get resolved. The Congress will have to quit the habit of dividing the country in the name of religion,"" Bharti said, reiterating that all political parties should unite on this issue. Bharti, who had participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1990s, said she was fully committed to the construction of Ram temple. ""If they tell me that Ram Mandir will be built only over my dead body, then so be it,"" she said.

PTI,"The Supreme Court on Friday, 2 November, dismissed the CBI's appeal against the Delhi High Court's 2005 verdict discharging all the accused, including the Hinduja brothers, in the politically-sensitive Rs 64 crore Bofors pay-off case. A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi rejected the CBI plea seeking condonation of the 13-year delay in filing the appeal against the 31 May 2005 judgment of the high court. It said it was not convinced with the grounds of the CBI to condone over 4,500 days' delay in filing the appeal. The CBI had filed the appeal on 2 February this year. The apex court, however, said the CBI can raise all grounds in the appeal against the same high court verdict filed by advocate Ajay Agrawal who has also challenged the judgment. The top court has already admitted the petition filed by Agrawal who had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election against the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareilly. Attorney General KK Venugopal asked the top court to make it clear in its order that dismissal of CBI appeal would not preclude the probe agency from carrying out investigation in the case. The apex court, however, did not mention anything in its order on this issue. After the NDA government came to power, there were speculations that the CBI would take a call to either respond as a respondent in Agrawal's petition or prefer a separate appeal. After lot of deliberation, the CBI this year got the nod from the NDA government to file an appeal in the apex court. The filing of the appeal assumes significance as Attorney General KK Venugopal in January had advised the agency against moving a petition against the high court verdict after a delay of more than a decade. Later, after consultations, law officers were in favour of the appeal as the CBI came out with ""some important documents and evidence"" to challenge the high court order. Hershman, who is the president of the US-based private detective firm Fairfax, had claimed in television interviews that Rajiv Gandhi was ""furious"" when he had found a Swiss bank account ""Mont Blanc"". He had also alleged that the bribe money of the Bofors gun scandal had been parked in the Swiss account. The CBI in its appeal stated that further investigation was necessary in view of the reports relating to Hershman's interviews. Before the 2005 verdict of Justice RS Sodhi (since retired), another judge of the Delhi High Court, retired Justice JD Kapoor, had on 4 February 2004, exonerated Rajiv Gandhi in the case and directed the framing of charge of forgery under section 465 of the IPC against Bofors company. Swedish Radio on 16 April 1987 had claimed that the company had paid bribes to top Indian politicians and defence personnel. The CBI on January 22 1990 had registered the FIR for alleged offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code and other sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Martin Ardbo, the then president of AB Bofors, alleged middleman Win Chadda and the Hinduja brothers. It had alleged that certain public servants and private persons in India and abroad had entered into a criminal conspiracy between 1982 and 1987 in pursuance of which the offences of bribery, corruption, cheating and forgery were committed. The first charge sheet in the case was filed on 22 October 1999 against Chadda, Ottavio Quattrocchi, the then defence secretary SK Bhatnagar, Ardbo and the Bofors company. A supplementary charge sheet was filed against the Hinduja brothers on 9 October 2000. A special CBI court in Delhi on 4 March 2011 had discharged Quattrocchi from the case, saying the country could not afford to spend hard-earned money on his extradition which had already cost Rs 250 crore.

The Quint,"The Donald Trump administration on Friday, 2 November, announced the return of all US sanctions on Iran that were lifted under 2015 nuclear deal. The US has agreed to give sanction waivers to eight countries – including India, Japan, and South Korea – to keep buying oil from Iran after it reimposes sanctions on Tehran on 5 November,   reported, quoting a senior official. The sanctions will take effect on Monday and cover Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors. It's the second batch of penalties that the administration has reimposed since President Donald Trump withdrew from the landmark deal in May. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are ""aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran."" He has released a list of 12 demands that Iran must meet if it wants the sanctions lifted. They include ending support for terrorism, ending military engagement in Syria and completely halting its nuclear and ballistic missile development. Pompeo said that eight nations, which other officials identified as U.S. allies such as Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, will receive temporary waivers allowing them to continue to import Iranian petroleum products for a limited period as long as they end such imports entirely. It is not clear on the volume of oil the nations will be allowed to buy under the exemptions. These sanctions are a pressure tactic to constrain Iran's nuclear programme. The report states that an estimated reduction of 1.1 million barrels a month has been managed by the pressure campaign, according to US estimates. Deputy State Department spokesman Robert Palladino at a briefing on Thursday, said: Earlier reports said that US was considering ""significant reduction exceptions"" on a ""case-by-case basis"" for countries to bring down their oil purchase from Iran to zero ahead of the deadline set by the Trump administration, or face sanction. India was supposed to get a waiver according to these reports. According to PTI, India, which is the second biggest purchaser of Iranian oil after China, was willing to restrict its monthly purchase to 1.25 million tonnes or 15 million tonnes in a year (300,000 barrels per day), down from 22.6 million tonnes (452,000 barrels per day) bought in 2017-18 financial year. India has been engaged with the United States regarding oil imports from Iran. In response to queries at a media briefing following reports that Washington might have given a waiver to New Delhi, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said: ""We will continue to engage with the US and other stakeholders to ensure that our energy security is not compromised and also that our national interests are protected.""

Delhi BJP leader Rajeev Babbar had earlier filed a complaint against Tharoor’s alleged “scorpion” remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said his religious sentiments were hurt by the statement. The complaint, filed through advocate Neeraj, termed the statement an ""intolerable abuse"" and ""absolute vilification"" of the faith of millions of people. According to  , Tharoor was at the event owing to his recently released book – ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister’ – and had said that the Prime Minister’s “personality cult” did not go down well with a lot of insiders in the RSS. Reacting to the defamation suit, Tharoor told reporters, ""The charges are frivolous ... If we start to stifle the right of the people to quote published material then where would our democracy head? Where is the freedom of expression?"" Tharoor said he had quoted an article published in a magazine in 2012 in which a comment of an unnamed RSS leader had been mentioned. ""So why has this defamation suit been filed against me now? In my book, I as a writer had quoted 5,000 other examples and stories,"" he said. Tharoor said he did not believe that he had done anything wrong or out of the ordinary and any author would have felt free to quote such published material in writing. ""I have also quoted Mr Modi's authorised biography by Andy Marino quite extensively. So it is not as if the 500-page book can be reduced to one line which this particular complainant doesn't like,"" Tharoor, also a writer and former diplomat, said. ""I am surprised to hear about the defamation suit. I hope the judge will throw it out on the grounds that this is the actual fact. But if not then certainly we have to defend it,"" Tharoor asserted. The complaint was filed under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code relating to defamation. The matter is likely to come up for hearing next Saturday, 10 November.

Arun Dev,"On Friday, 2 November, the BJP in Karnataka was on damage control mode. While a set of leaders gave sharply worded statements against Congress for their “Trojan horse” tactics, the other approached the Karnataka Chief Election Commission, demanding the postponement of the by-election in Ramanagara assembly constituency. During the 24 hours that followed Chandrashekar’s defection, the BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa was at the receiving end of the wrath of the party’s central leadership. Three other leaders – union minister DV Sadananda Gowda, R Ashoka and CP Yogeshwar, who were in charge of Old Mysore region of Karnataka, to which Ramanagram belonged – too came under fire. Hours after L Chandrashekar left the BJP, the optics within the Congress camp painted a clearer picture. MChandrashekar travelled in Congress MP DK Suresh’s car to a local Congress party office to address the media. DK Suresh is the younger brother of inister for Irrigation, DK Shivakumar, who is known as the Congress party’s crisis manager in the state. At the press meet, DK Suresh said Chandrashekar has given his unconditional support to the JD(S)-Congress alliance candidate Anitha Kumaraswamy, the wife of the Karnataka chief minister. Chandrashekar had joined the BJP, three days before the last day of filing nominations for the by-election. He had then claimed that he left the Congress because he was unhappy over the Congress’ decision to leave the Ramanagara seat for the JD(S), where he was to be the Congress candidate. In the Congress camp, this coup d'etat is being dubbed as   (The Congress party symbol). Lets rewind back to 15 May 2018, the day the Karnataka assembly election results were announced. At the basement of BJP’s Bengaluru headquarters, the group of advisers to BS Yeddyurappa were having an informal chat with reporters. Just minutes before, the JD(S) and Congress had announced an alliance, and Yeddyurappa was racing against time to reach the Raj Bhavan to claim his right to form government, this despite the fact that he was short of a simple majority. Yeddyurappa’s advisers argued that it was the RSS insistence to field leaders from the cadre that cost the Lingayat leader’s chances of reclaiming the chief ministerial throne. “If it wasn’t for the RSS, we could have won with absolute majority, but they didn’t allow Yeddyurappa to field all of his candidates,” said one of the advisers. He was referring to the infighting within the party during the candidate selection ahead of the assembly polls. The RSS faction and the BSY faction had their difference, which prolonged the process and resulted in shuffling of candidates several times. For the BSY camp, it was clear that BSY’s choice of candidates would have ensured victory. But during the candidate selection meetings in New Delhi, RSS insisted on candidates of their own choice, many of them failed to win the election. Taking credit for the 104 seats the party won in the assembly election, Yeddyurappa had proven himself to be more reliable than the RSS. While the RSS was handling their case against Yeddyurappa internally, senior BJP leader and MLC Leher Singh wrote a letter accusing Yeddyurappa of tarnishing PM Modi’s image for small political gain. The letter was written in the context of the Ramanagara mismanagement. Ramanagara is a stronghold of the JD(S) and coup was not needed to ensure victory. But the BJP, through this election, was hoping to make inroads into the Old Mysore Region of Karnataka, where it doesn’t have strong base. This attempt has been successfully stopped. As for the by-elections – which is also a litmus test of the coalition’s unity – the Congress has sent a strong message to its coalition partner JD(S). But most importantly, the Congress has managed to create an internal rift within the BJP, which was clear by the RSS’s move against Yeddyurappa. “It could be seen like two Vokkaliga leaders have come together against Yeddyurappa, a Lingayat leader. This could help Yeddyurappa gain sympathy votes in Jamkhandi and Bellary constituencies (which will also be going for the by-election). These places are dominated by Lingayat voters. Ramanagara was an easy seat to win for the coalition, but this has made fights in the tougher constituencies even more difficult,” the leader said. Even though under pressure from the national leadership and leaders in Karnataka, it will be difficult to replace Yeddyurappa as the face of the party. “Is there another mass leader in Karnataka?” asked one of the senior BJP leaders commenting on the issue. “With the Congress and JD(S) coming together in Old Mysore Region, the focus will be on north Karnataka. In this Lingayat-dominated region, Yeddyurappa still remains the leader of the masses. So any attempt to sideline him in the 2019 general election would backfire for the party,” he said. However, the coup pulled off by the DK brothers have managed to rattle the BJP and has taken away their chances of setting up a base in the Old Mysore Region for now.

Haq's son, Hamidul Haq, said his father was alone in his bedroom when he was attacked by an assailant, who escaped undetected. Hamidul confirmed that his father was attacked with knife, reported PTI. Police say Haq was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died. JUI-S's Peshawar president also confirmed Haq's death following an assassination attempt in Rawalpindi. Yousaf Shah, Haq's spokesman, told The Associated Press that neither the attacker nor their motive was yet known. So far, no outfit has claimed the responsibility of the killing. A probe has been launched to nab the assailants who apparently escaped on a motorbike, police said.   Haq's funeral services will be held at 2:00 PM on Saturday in Akora Khattak. Several groups have been protesting against the Supreme Court's ruling and Haq’s death is likely to exacerbate the already volatile situation in the country. A well-known religious scholar with a large following among radical Islamists, Haq was the head of his faction of the Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam (JUI) party. Haq's sprawling Haqqani seminary taught many of Afghanistan's Taliban and thousands of other students a strict interpretation of Islam. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the Haqqani network, a US-designated terrorist organization, was one of dozens of Taliban leaders who graduated from Haq's seminary, located in the conservative Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan. In recent weeks, dozens of Afghan clerics had appealed to Haq to use his influence with Afghanistan's Taliban to plot a path to peace that would end the 17-year-long war there. Haq was elected twice to Pakistan's parliament on Islami Jamhoori Itehad ticket. He was also the chairman of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council – an umbrella coalition of more than 40 groups, including Hafeez Saeed-led Jamat-ud Dawa (JuD) and the banned Sipah-e-Sahaba. Pakistan's President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned Haq's killing. ""We lost a great scholar and religious leader today,"" said Khan in a statement from China where he is on an official visit. Khan was widely criticized for embracing Haq ahead of Pakistan's July elections that put the former cricketer-turned-politician in power. Khan's provincial government in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa donated millions of dollars to Haq's hard-line seminary. He defended the move saying he wanted to see Pakistan's thousands of madrassas, or religious schools, broaden their curriculum. Former PM Nawaz Sharif reportedly said: Meanwhile, his brother and Leader of Opposition in Pakistan's National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif called Haq's murder a ""despicable ploy to cause further disturbance in Pakistan"", as he called for unity of the nation.

The Quint,"The state of Uttar Pradesh will play a make-or-break role in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with the fortunes of the Mahagathbandhan (that is, an SP and BSP combine) determining whether the NDA will win a majority in the country or not. This is the prediction of the latest CVoter-State Of The Nation October 2018 survey, just months before the general elections in 2019. Predicting NDA's vote share to be 38 percent and seat share to be 300 without the Mahagathbandhan in UP, the survey also notes that this is lower than the 41 percent vote share and the 335 seats which it had predicted in January 2018. This, it says, is due to several factors, including the TDP breaking ties with the NDA, the Shiv Sena deciding to go solo, the successful experimentation of the Mahagathbandhan in UP, and the materialising of the JD(S)-Congress alliance in Karnataka. The survey – taking into account political equations as on today – predicts that without the Mahagathbandhan in UP, the NDA would be able to get 300 out of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha. The UPA would get 116, while Others would get 127. The 300 mark of the NDA would be well above the majority mark in the Lower House. However, the equation would change if the Mahagathbandhan materialises in UP, that is, if the SP and BSP decide to come together. If that is the scenario, then the NDA's tally would go down to 261 in the Lok Sabha, which is below the majority mark, the survey said. Meanwhile, the UPA is projected to get 119 seats and Others (which would include this Mahagathbandhan) would move up to 163 seats. The survey points out that the UPA would greatly benefit if the Congress has alliances with the various regional parties in four politically crucial states. The UPA would get a majority within the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh if Rahul Gandhi’s party allies with the TDP, JD(S), NCP and the Mahagathbandhan respectively, the survey says. The survey predicted that the UPA, in its best case scenario, would win 204 seats in the Lok Sabha, while the NDA would get 232 seats. Meanwhile, the Others would be able to win in 107 seats. This best case scenario for the UPA would be made possible only if: In the case of such a verdict, regional parties like the DMK, the TRS and the YSRCP would play the key role in deciding who will come to power at the Centre. On the other hand, in the best case scenario for the NDA, it would be able to garner 306 seats, below the 336 it got in 2014. The UPA, meanwhile, would get 108 seats and Others 129 seats.

Suryatapa Mukherjee,"That’s what Yoaz Hendel said to  . The Israeli media commentator and former spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was talking about 17-year-old Palestinian Ahed Tamimi. A few days later, the David and Goliath narrative went viral on Twitter. But it wasn’t about Tamimi. A photograph of 20-year-old A'ed Abu Amro with a slingshot in one hand and a Palestinian flag on the other, spread across social media. It was compared with Eugene Delacroix’s French Revolution painting, Liberty Leading the People. It was also compared with the Poseidon of Melos statue where the Greek god is aiding the Greeks in the Trojan War. Calling the photo “iconic,”   reports Abu Amro was participating in a weekly demonstration that began in March. Palestinians have been demanding their “right of return” to the homes and land their families were expelled from 70 years ago by the state of Israel. Titled ‘13th attempt to break the Gaza blockade by sea,’ the photo was snapped by journalist Mustafa Hassona on a beach close to the border with Israel. The protests are also aimed at ending the 11-year-old Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. The case of Ahed Tamimi is a year old. Then a 16-year-old, Tamimi was handed an eight-month prison sentence for slapping an Israel Defense Forces soldier. ABC News reported that weeks after the end of her incarceration, Tamimi embarked on a “victory tour” across France, Spain, Greece, Tunisia and Jordan. Traditionally, Israel is particular about defending its international image. The term  , roughly translating to ‘public relations’, is part of its national lexicon, reports  . But Tamimi's reception at Real Madrid CF was the straw that broke the camel’s back. There, she met striker Emilio Butragueno, and received a team jersey with her name. In response, Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon took to Twitter. Israel has an annual PR-training course in Washington, press officers in every ministry and embassy, and its foreign ministry monitors international coverage around the clock.   reported that Palestinians are “not only outgunned, but outmessaged” by their neighbour. In her paper on  , journalist and writer Victoria Brittain says the western press has been complying with the official Israeli version of events for over six decades. So, how did Tamimi and Abu Amro break the mould? Speaking about Tamimi, journalist and writer Ben Ehrenreich told  In fact – because of their light features and “American” style of clothing – the Israeli government had investigated if the Tamimis were a real Palestinian family, or paid actors, reported  . They ascertained that it “apparently is a family” but the classified investigation remains inconclusive. Michael Oren, an Israeli deputy minister and former ambassador to the United States, headed the investigating panel On the other hand, A'ed Abu Amro’s popularity is marked with fetishisation and detachment, opines  . All the comparison with art ensures that his struggle is romanticised as picturesque, its horrors not truly realised. This begs the question, if Tamimi was darker and Abu Amro less muscular, would they have garnered as much positive attention? Brittain suggests that there is something larger at play. She says the change in western attitudes to the conflict is a result of grass roots media initiatives by younger Palestinian academics, journalists, writers, filmmakers and lawyers. And the internet has shifted the power dynamics in journalism as compared to two or three decades ago. The video that led to Tamimi’s incarceration, was not her first. Ahed was first   confronting an Israeli soldier when she was 11, after her older brother had been arrested by the army. Again three years later, she was   fighting a soldier who had her younger brother in a chokehold. On a similar note, Abu Amro’s photo shot to global prominence only after it was shared on Twitter, by Laleh Khalili. She is an Iranian-American and a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. US Campaign for Palestinian Rights’ Executive Director, Yousef Munayyer, was the first to draw the French Revolution parallel. On his own profile, Munayyer used the David and Goliath narrative and also compared the photo to Michelangelo's nude sculpture.

Khemta H Jose,"When Italian PM Giuseppe Conte arrived in Delhi on Tuesday, 30 October, he and Prime Minister Modi waxed lyrical about technology cooperation between India and Italy at the India-Italy Tech Summit. But nowhere in the public interaction did we see PM Modi rake up an issue that he campaigned loudly on in 2014 – that of the two Italian marines who killed two fishermen in Kerala in 2013. Italian marines who, instead of standing trial in India, were allowed to return to Italy – one of them, on Modi's watch. The PMs of both countries have even agreed to put the past behind them now. That's quite a generous concession on PM Modi's behalf, considering that in Opposition, he was full-throated in calling for the marines' return to face justice in India, implicating then-Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the case because of her Italian roots: The two marines, Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, stand accused of shooting dead two fisherman at sea, just off the Kerala coast, while they were aboard the MV Enrica Lexie, an Italian oil tanker, on 15 February 2012. The Kerala authorities took the marines into custody at Kochi port days after the incident to face murder charges, and there began the protracted legal battle over jurisdiction. Rome, of course, insisted on handling the case on its own shores since it says the incident happened in international waters and on an Italian ship. India claims the killing happened in Kerala's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and therefore squarely within India's jurisdiction. In 2012, the case had turned nasty, fast. The Italians were accused of working through the Kerala church to pay the families of the dead fishermen ‘blood money’ – the families received Rs 1 crore each from the Italian government in an extralegal settlement brokered by the church in Kerala and priests from the Vatican in exchange for withdrawing their cases in various courts against the marines and the ship-owner. They also wrote a letter to the Vatican saying that they forgave the marines. The Kerala High Court had approved the settlement, but the Supreme Court took exception, slamming the state government for not objecting to the settlement, and calling it a “direct challenge to the Indian judicial system”. India and Italy then had an 11-day diplomatic row as the Italian government went back on its word. After India allowed the two marines to return to Italy to vote in the general election in February 2013, Italy refused to send them back to face the music in India as promised. At this point, the Supreme Court passed an order saying the Italian ambassador would not be allowed to leave the country unless the marines returned – Italy softened, and sent them back. ""I am resigning because for 40 years I have maintained, and still maintain, that the reputation of the country, the armed forces and Italian diplomacy, should be safeguarded,""  . ""I am also standing down in solidarity with our two marines and their families. In India, too, the government faced domestic heat over the decision to relax the marines' bail conditions and allow them to return to Italy – but that heat, prior to 2014, was generated by Modi, protesting the decision to allow the marines to leave India after they “mercilessly killed” the fishermen. And after 2014? After 2014, there was silence from the new government on the case. This is after an Opposition Modi in 2012 slammed the UPA-led government for allowing Latorre to return to Italy on compassionate grounds after he had a stroke. In 2016,  reported that defence middleman in the Augusta-Westland chopper case, Christian Michel, came out and said that PM Modi had tried to broker a back-room deal with the Italian PM, in which Italy would offer evidence linking the Gandhi family to Michel himself, in exchange for India taking a soft line on the marines case (with the caveat that it could not independently verify the allegation). The next month, when Girone was allowed out on bail to go back to Italy, Congress accused the Centre of working hand-in-glove with the Italian PM to let the marines off if they provided evidence to link the Gandhis to the chopper scam. Now, the case is in international arbitration to decide jurisdiction, and the Italian marines are safely back in Italy as the Italian PM meets Modi and the two discuss technology and cooperation – while two Kerala fishermen are still dead. If what happens to the marines is a reflection of patriotism, how patriotic are we now? (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Amruta Chimote,"(   I went to watch a movie with a friend recently. After sitting down in the second-last row of the theatre, I heard a group of young men, seated behind us, indulging in loud, vulgar chatter. Seated beside me were a couple of young men – one of them was loudly talking on his cell phone, which continued at constant intervals before the movie started and kept disturbing the audience. This is when I realised and accepted that I would simply have to put up with this nuisance at the theatre. As the national anthem played before the film started, in an attempt to induce nationalism (quite odd for a movie theatre), I stood up with the others, but in complete indifference and with the involuntary fear of being jeered at for the lack of so-called patriotism. A nationalistic fervour ran across the exhilarated crowd, among them were these young men seated around us. They fervently started chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Vande Mataram”, as though invoking the spirit of the days of India’s freedom struggle. Minutes after we settled down and the title credits started rolling, the film started with a thought-provoking quote by Gandhi. Without wasting a minute and totally unmindful of the quote, they started ridiculing the man. One of them yelled, “Iss buddhe ko dekhne nahi aye hum” (we haven’t come all the way to watch this old-timer), and the others responded with grotesque laughter. Willful misinformation and other propaganda glorifying jingoism have been regularly fed to the populace for long now for obvious political reasons. I have myself come across quite a lot of such misleading material about several respected figures. I Coming back to the story — I couldn’t sit still and grew restless with the increasing heckling and loathsome behaviour of these people, but my friend and I kept quiet out of fear, in order to avoid getting into any kind of brawl (judging from the kind of crowd it was). The ultra-nationalism and the contempt towards figures like Gandhi coming from ignorant minds was so despicable it made me wonder if these are the very people who constitute the lynch mobs that beat up people amidst the chants of   or is it that I was over-analyzing? When I say “I stood up for the national anthem in complete indifference,” I don’t mean I am not a patriot. But more than the forced symbolism and deification, I believe in bigger actions. I am quite aware of the rickety education system of our country and the poverty that enables the robbing of childhood from children, who are forced into manual labour. I have witnessed the contempt of fellow Indians towards minorities and the hatred of some towards the asylum being offered to the persecuted Rohingya. I am well aware of the slander and witch-hunting of social activists, honest journalists, and of those who fight against the political machinery. For me, more than symbolism, a genuine effort towards my people’s well-being is what matters. For me the development and advancement of the populace as human beings makes up patriotism. And if “nationalism” is the new brand of ‘patriotism,’ I am better off without it. This very feeling can be credibly expressed in the words Rabindranath Tagore: “Even though from childhood I had been taught that the idolatry of Nation is almost better than reverence for God and humanity, I believe I have outgrown that teaching, and it is my conviction that my countrymen will gain truly by fighting against that education which teaches them that a country is greater than the ideals of humanity.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"The Supreme Court on Thursday, 1 November, extended the deadline for filing of claims and objections for inclusion of names in Assam's National Register of Citizens to 15 December. A bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and RF Nariman had earlier set a time period of 60 days, beginning 25 September, to file claims and objections. According to PTI, the top court also fixed the timeline for issuance of notice as 15 January 2019 and verification of documents as 1 February. Over 40 lakh claimants, whose names were not included in the final draft of the NRC released 30 July, have been allowed by the Bench to produce five more documents to assert their claims to citizenship. Ten out of the original fifteen ""list A"" documents had been permitted earlier for the same. In September, NRC State coordinator Pratik Hajela in his report to the Supreme Court had expressed his reservations in including the five documents, which he said could be 'misused' to get illegal migrants into NRC. Earlier in October, the court had sought the views of Hajela on permitting their use as favoured by the Centre in its 17 September affidavit. The court had kept out five identity documents that included extract of NRC of 1951; extract/certified copy of electoral rolls up to midnight of 24 March 1971; refugee registration certificate issued up to 24 March 1971; and ration cards issued by competent authority with official seal and signature up to 24 March 1971 (midnight). Hajela had said in his report that a person could have more than one legacy data code, and unused codes could be used by imposters. However, the Assam government on 31 October said that all 15 documents should be used in the exercise.

Sanam Sutirath Wazir,"For most, November is a month of festivities. Homes are cleaned, walls painted, facades lit up. But for some, darkness still looms large in their lives. Take for instance, the example of Joginder Kaur. For her, November is a month of mourning, sadness and plain horror. This is the month in which she lost everything she had. ‘’On 1 November, my husband was attacked with swords and sticks; he was lying on charpoy in a vegetative state for three days, the kids were sitting close to him and not ready to move. The mob again entered our home on the third day and killed him. We lost everything in 1984. Our future, our right to progress, everything. My younger son was in depression and one day he left the house and never came back,’’ says Joginder Kaur. While this year marks the 34th anniversary of 1984 Sikh massacre, these familes are still waiting for the perpetrators to be brought to book. In these 34 years, 12 commissions and committees have investigated the incident but it hasn’t gone beyond that. Many have since, died waiting, their families left to fend for themselves. In August 2017, the Supreme Court constituted a supervisory body comprising two former Supreme Court judges to see if the closure of the cases by the Special Investigation Team was justified. On 11 January 2018, after the supervisory body submitted its report in the Supreme Court, the Court decided to set up its own three-member SIT to probe 186 cases which had not been reopened by the Union government’s SIT. The new team will be headed by a former High Court judge, Justice SN Dhingra. However, nearly ten months later, the third member of the SIT is yet to be appointed. India has a shameful history of forgetting victims of communal violence; they are often used only as political bait during elections. For the death of 3,000 persons in Delhi alone (during the 1984 massacre), less than one percent have been convicted so far. Only 587 FIRs were registered, and 247 cases were closed. He said his government would implement the rule of law in true letter and spirit. But four years have passed, and yet the inquiry is nowhere close to completion. It looks like the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) is no different from its predecessors. They were quick to win the hearts of the community during the 2014 elections by making a public commitment that if voted to power, they would bring justice to the victims of communal violence. For once, politicians should let the politics over the massacres of 1984 take a back seat and let the evidence speak for itself. 34 years may be a long time to wait, but it can turn out to be a historic opportunity for the NDA government to deliver justice while the victims are still alive. There is a kind of restiveness among the Sikh community within the country and in the Sikh diaspora, over the inexplicable delay in justice to the victims of the 1984 massacre. An embittered population is not good for long-term peace, and the stability of the country. Those among the culprits who are still alive, must be punished, failing which, it a bad precedent would be set. The Congress has failed the victims of the 1984 Sikh massacre; the BJP has the opportunity to correct this historical wrong, but it seems they too are not interested. The trauma transcended to the next generation with them suffering the consequences of that violence. The screams of the victims still echo in the narrow lanes of Delhi where thousands were butchered over three decades ago. It is time for India to learn how to ensure that the brutalities of 1984 do not remain a festering sore. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

However, he sidestepped Sanghvi's question on who would ""lead"" the Oppositon. Yadav claimed that he did not ""see the big dream"" of becoming the prime minister.

Bhagat Singh,"India, at present, is in a very pitiable condition. The followers of one religion have become sworn enemies of those of the other. These days, being a follower of one religion is to be the enemy of the other; if one doesn’t agree with this view, then one merely has to look at the latest incident of riots in Lahore: how Muslims murdered innocent Sikhs and Hindus, and how Sikhs also did not leave any stone unturned in murdering Muslims vengefully. Similarly, it seemed enough for a Hindu or a Sikh to kill a Muslim for his being Muslim alone. Only God can save India in such a situation. Indeed, under such circumstances, the future of India looks very dark. These religions have left the country in a lurch. And we don’t know when these communal riots will leave Bharat alone. These riots have hurled notoriety upon the clean image of India, and we have seen that every blind faith-filled person starts drifting with the flow. There is hardly any Hindu, Sikh or Muslim who keeps his mind cool. On the contrary, all these people having blind faith in one or the other religion pick up batons, swords and daggers to smash the heads of others. And after doing so, some kiss the noose while others are lodged in jails. On the face of it, communal leaders and newspapers are behind all these riots. Today, the leaders in India have come to that blind end where it is better to keep quiet. The same leaders who had wielded the responsibility of liberating the country and those who were crying out ‘common nationality’ and ‘Swaraj-Swaraj’, the same have remained hidden with their heads between their knees or begun drifting in the same flow. There was a time when the leaders who wanted a common welfare plan were very few, and the wave of religion was so strong that they felt unable to prevent the accompanying bloodshed. The leaders in India have become politically bankrupt. The second factor which added fuel to fire were the newspapers. The profession of journalism which was once regarded as a very noble one – now it has become evil. These people arouse public sentiment by writing bold headlines in the newspapers against one or the other and compel people to start fighting with one another. Not limited to just one or two places, riots started in many locations just because of the fact that local newspapers had written articles that stoked passions. Very few writers maintained their cool in such situations. But these papers behaved in a manner entirely antithetical to their duties. Their sole motive was to spread hysteria, preach narrow-mindedness, fundamentalism, instigate clashes and destroy the common heritage of India. That is why one is so pained to see the present condition of the country and one wonders what will happen to our country. The people who remember the enthusiasm of the period of non-cooperation feel like crying on seeing this present condition of the country. Those were the days when freedom seemed very near but now Swaraj has become just a dream. And this was the third advantage that has been achieved by party partisanship. If we wish to know the moot reason for these riots, we will find that it is an economic one. During the period of non-cooperation leaders and journalists had sacrificed a lot. Their economic condition had deteriorated. After the non-cooperation movement became weak, the leaders of the movement also became irrelevant. The business of many communal leaders thus came to an end. Any activity that starts in this world has at its base the question of livelihood. It is the foremost principle among the three basic principles of Marx. Because of this principle, Tableeque, Takzeem and reformist organisations developed and this marked the beginnings of the state we now find ourselves in. Any improvement in the matter of these riots is only possible if there is an improvement in the economic conditions of India. Bharat’s economic condition is so bad that someone can pay the other (a bribe) of four annas in order to get him defamed. When suffering from hunger and strife everybody is prepared to shun all principles. One is ready to do anything when confronted with the question of life or death. But it is very difficult to have economic improvement in such a state of affairs as the present. Because the government is an alien one and it doesn’t let the conditions of the Indians improve. We must, therefore, change it at any cost and till it is changed, we should not rest. We need to inculcate class consciousness to prevent people from fighting. The poor workers and peasants should be clearly told that their foremost enemies are the capitalists and they should keep aloof from their maneuverings, and not be instigated by them. People all over the world have similar rights, whether they belong to any race, caste or creed. Your welfare lies in becoming united and trying to snatch the power from the government to take it in your hands. The people who are well-versed with Russian history know that in the days of the Czar the condition of Russia was even worse than India’s present condition; there were so many communities in the country and they were all fighting among themselves. And when worker’s rule got established in Russia, the position changed altogether. Now no riots occur there, and everybody is considered a human being first and not a religious entity. During the period of the Czar, the financial condition of the people of Russia was very bad. This was the main reason behind the riots. But now the economic condition of the Russians has improved and class consciousness has become prevalent among them, so they don’t have any riots. Riots are always replete with disheartening news but during the riots in Calcutta one good thing happened as well. The workers didn’t take any part in the riots and the trade unions even tried to pacify the violent mob. These people had become class conscious and knew to look out for their class interests. Class consciousness is the main tool which can help in preventing riots. It shows that the future of India is very bright and people should not dread these riots, rather they should create an atmosphere in which there would be no possibility of riots. The martyrs of 1914–15 had separated religion from politics. They felt that religious people had their own obligations and no one could interfere with that. They also felt that religion should not intrude on politics because it does not allow people to work jointly for a common cause. This is why they could stick together during the Ghadar movement, and Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims all sacrificed everything in that movement. Some Indian leaders have now emerged at the forefront who also wish to separate religion from politics. It is a very apt solution to avert all the clashes (that have been happening) and we too approve of this. If religion is separated from politics, then all of us can jointly initiate political activities, even though in matters of religion we might have many differences with each other. We feel that the true well-wishers of India would follow these principles and save India from the suicidal path it is on at present. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Sahal Muhammed,"After the 1984 general elections, Rajiv Gandhi was the Golden Boy of Indian politics. He had a majority of 414 MPs, more than what even his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru could manage. However, armed with this secure mandate, he made a series of decisions riven with insecurity. It all started with a pro-women verdict. In 1985, the Supreme Court decreed that 62-year-old Shah Bano was entitled to maintenance from her former husband. However, Gandhi chose to bow to Muslim fundamentalists and overturned the verdict. And then, fearing a Hindu backlash, he opened the Ayodhya temple, setting off a series of events which have irreparably damaged the country’s secular fabric and are poised to influence yet another Lok Sabha election in 2019. Thirty-three years later, another pro-women verdict by the Supreme Court, this time allowing the entry of women of all ages at the 13th century hill shrine of Sabarimala in Kerala, put a similar dilemma in front the Congress. They chose the Rajiv Gandhi way. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has long been looking to get a foothold in God’s Own Country. The number of   in the tiny state is second only to that in Uttar Pradesh. However, the struggle has produced just a solitary MLA and their wait for an Ayodhya moment has continued. Yet, the Congress has reason to worry about the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rise. Although it was long prophesied that the saffron party will wrest votes from the CPI(M), which has a broader Hindu base, the Congress’ own privileged caste vote has been proven to have itchy feet. The Congress has been heavily dependent on its alliance partners, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Kerala Congress, to pull in the Muslim and Christian votes, respectively. The party has just 22 MLAs in the current 140-member Assembly, while the IUML has 18 and the two Kerala Congress factions have 7. The response of the Congress has been nearly indistinguishable from that of the RSS. KPCC Working President K Sudhakaran has been particularly vocal, calling menstruation an “impurity” and daring a policeman to hit him in public. He has also called the SC judges “idiots” and has gone to the extent of stating that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be the Congress’ “Waterloo” if they fail to stand with the devotees. “The Congress is pitched in opposition to the CPI(M) in Kerala, unlike the BJP at the national level. This has led to them taking steps such as opposing the land reform bill and the education bill in 1959,” says KN Ganesh, Professor of History at Calicut University. The education bill tabled by the Communist Party of India (CPI) government in 1957 had promised better wages for teachers. The Nair Service Society (NSS) and the Catholic Church, which ran numerous educational institutions, felt threatened by the bill and formed an opportunistic alliance with the Congress. This led to what is rather ironically called the ‘Vimochana Samaram’ (Struggle for Liberation), resulting in the dismissal of the first democratically elected government of Kerala by the then Prime Minister Nehru. “This is the trap that Congress has fallen into again,” he says. But times they are a changin. While the Congress had made political hay taking reactionary positions in the past, this time they might be playing into the hands of the saffron forces. It wouldn’t be the first time. “The debate was between the Constitution on one side and faith on the other. Now, in the name of faith, the protest has been hijacked by Hindutva forces,” he adds. The Congress’ response has been brought to sharper relief by the unwavering stand in support of the verdict by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “This has earned him the support of many leftist groups which were wary of many of his other policies,” says NK Bhoopesh, executive editor of Malayalam news portal The Newsrupt. “As such the CPM may not lose a lot of ground but the same cannot be said of the Congress,” he says. A post-poll analysis by CSDS after the 2016 Assembly elections had found that 34 percent of the privileged caste Nair vote, which traditionally belonged the Congress, had gone to the BJP. The NSS has been at the forefront of the protests against the present verdict. “Even if the party was worried about losing the Nair vote, as a secular constitutional party, it could have worked to preserve the still sizeable secular seam within the community,” says Elayidom. “Escorting them to the Hindutva camp was not the solution,” he says. While it might be too early to predict the electoral fallout of the issue, the Sangh Parivar has, perhaps for the first time, been able to set the agenda of political debate in the state. “The thinking of the Congress might be that the BJP shouldn’t take all credit for the Sabarimala protest. The Congress had fielded D Vijayakumar, national vice president of Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sangham, in the recent Chengannur bypolls. The party might attempt something like that again,” says Ganesh. “But it does not matter who wins and who loses. This game of polarisation is extremely dangerous for Kerala society,” he says.

Sanjay Pugalia,"A tussle is brewing between the government and RBI. According to sources, the government may implement Section 7 of the RBI Act to weaken the institution’s autonomy – no Indian government has ever done this before. Due to the scarcity of cash in the market, the government wants to take a loan from the Reserve Bank which tightens the noose around 'weak' government banks. In order to give money to the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), the government wants to be free from RBI's strict control. After a fear of cash crunch in the case of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) defaults, a tussle between the government and Reserve Bank over sending power companies to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) emerged. During the IL&FS crisis, people lost their faith in the market. Even foreign investors started withdrawing their capital and the value of the rupee fell. Keeping the fiscal deficit in check is a matter of concern ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The government is looking to the Reserve Bank for money but arrangements should have been made beforehand. RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya has said that there is an attempt to hamper the RBI's autonomy. The Centre indirectly said that the RBI has leaked information. RBI has been reiterating that it is the government's responsibility to tighten the noose around government banks. Amidst the economic crises in the country, the RBI-government tussle comes as a matter of concern. The claims of maintaining discipline, stopping non-performing assets (NPA) from increasing, stopping crony capitalism from flourishing – are proving to be false. The government is desperate to collect funds before the elections. The NDA government had promoted Urjit Patel to the post of RBI governor, and he is now desperate to maintain RBI's autonomy. There are shortcomings when it comes to RBI regulations but at this time, the government should maintain good relations with other institutions. The Centre has hinted at a discussion but one doesn’t seem to have occurred. So, the tussle between the RBI and the government has come to the forefront. There has always been tension between the two but that has always been resolved too through off-the-record talks. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Sreeram Chaulia,"The crisis unleashed in Sri Lanka by President Maithripala Sirisena’s  Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the unexpected comeback of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, reflects deep underlying flaws in a country struggling to transition from authoritarianism to democracy and from war to peace. Seen through the prism of individual protagonists, the constitutional deadlock and head-spinning cloak-and-dagger maneuvers by former allies turned foes turned renewed friends—Sirisena and Rajapaksa—reveal how devious politicians are in this volatile Indian Ocean island. Betrayal of trust, backstabbing, and opportunism are, of course, part and parcel of competitive politics in many parts of the world. But these negative traits have been carried to an extreme cutthroat level in Sri Lanka where respect for institutions and consensus about how the country should be governed have gone for a toss. Sensing that his own political ambitions of running for a second term as president would be doomed if he remains stuck in a coalition with a Prime Minister like Wickremesinghe whose popularity was declining, he switched sides and hitched his wagon to an ascendant Rajapaksa. Lurid tales of an   against the President where the Prime Minister was allegedly complicit suggest that Wickremesinghe, or some of his aides, were also desperate to survive using any means available. None of the three main sides in this ruthless scramble for power bothered for constitutional propriety, the mandate of voters or the global image of the country. Undoubtedly, the principal politicians are guilty of undermining constitutionalism and democratic norms. The concept of an ‘Executive Presidency’ since 1978 has vested excess concentration of power in the hands of strong-willed heads of state such as J.R. Jayewardene (1978-1989), Chandrika Kumaratunga (1994-2005) and Rajapaksa (2005-2015). Accumulation of vast prerogatives in the hands of Presidents at the cost of Parliaments, Prime Ministers, and civil society has been challenged, most recently by Wickremesinghe through the Nineteenth Amendment to Sri Lanka’s fourth Constitution. But these attempts have run into stiff status quo-ist pushback from Presidents hailing from both the mainstream Sri Lankan political parties. One of the reasons why Wickremesinghe had to be booted out by Sirisena was that the former was backing a draft fifth Constitution that would introduce checks and balances against misuse of presidential authority. Reforms toward liberalisation of Sri Lanka’s polity are essential for a more moderate and less autocratic form of state power to emerge. The current climate of a ‘constitutional coup’ must be understood in terms of the lack of will and consensus about such an evolution. The second core factor that led to the breakdown of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe combine is the unresolved ethnic question and contestation over the makeup of the state between a unitary and a federal system. Despite the crushing defeat of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam through Rajapaksa’s no-holds-barred counter-insurgency in 2009, none of the leading Sinhalese political parties which have taken turns to rule since then have offered meaningful autonomy or justice for the war-ravaged Tamil and Muslim minorities of Sri Lanka. Ideologically, Wickremesinghe’s United National Party is inclined to be magnanimous in post-war reconciliation and reconstruction wherein ethnic minorities develop a sense of equality and belonging to Sri Lanka. But over the last three years, Wickremesinghe could not fulfill expectations raised by his electoral promises. Inquiries into war crimes against Tamil civilians during the armed conflict have been stonewalled and the military still calls the shots in the North and East of the country with hardly any delegation of powers to local Tamil and Muslim elected representatives. Calls from extremist politicians, military men, and Buddhist clerics to reject any tampering with Sri Lanka’s repressive unitary framework which privileges the central government and entrenches privileges for the ethnic majority Sinhalese have been so deafening and electorally potent that Wickremesinghe had to backtrack. To boot, Sirisena played a sly game of posing as a liberal while fearing the wrath of hardline Buddhist fundamentalists if he genuinely joined hands with Wickremesinghe to change Sri Lanka’s ‘ethnocratic’ system where the Sinhalese Buddhists get first-class citizenship rights and minorities are subjugated. Rajapaksa’s revived fortune today owes not only to the poor economic performance of the Wickremesinghe government since 2015 but also to the lingering ethno-religious chauvinist tendency among conservative Sinhalese who see Rajapaksa as their saviour against a liberal multicultural future. Much of the international attention during Sri Lanka’s current crisis has fallen on the geopolitical rivalry between India and China and how the two Asian giants are aligned with different local sides in Sri Lankan politics. The Rajapaksa camp’s critique that Wickremesinghe was parceling out prime infrastructural assets to India and turning Sri Lanka into a “sub-colony” of India rehashes a conspiratorial drumbeat of right-wing Sinhalese nationalists for decades. This charge is factually wrong because Wickremesinghe had actually upset India by delaying many of its proposed developmental projects in Sri Lanka. Despite the hard rightist portrayals in Sri Lanka of Wickremesinghe as a ‘pro-India’ politician, he hobnobbed with China and sought Chinese investments in Sri Lanka. In some instances, even if he wanted to favour and award infrastructure deals to India, Sirisena is believed to have used his overarching presidential control over foreign policymaking to stay the Prime Minister’s hand. Given the rapid shifts in alignments and policy positions, one interesting possibility is that Rajapaksa has also swiveled since the days when he was a blatantly pro-China politician. His September 2018 visit to India, meeting with Modi, and assurances that his vision is for an “inclusive” Sri Lanka that understands India’s “special concerns” convey that all is not lost for India as it looks on at the island’s troubles with concern. Moreover, if Rajapaksa does finagle a parliamentary majority and his pairing with Sirisena works out this time, the former will be quite constrained this time as Prime Minister compared to the era when he himself was President and abused power like a dictator. Security and foreign policy authority vests with the office of the President rather than the Prime Minister in the current Sri Lankan Constitution which looks set to remain in place due to Wickremesinghe’s ouster. India will, therefore, continue to engage closely with Sirisena to protect its strategic interests, while trying to further encourage Rajapaksa’s possible mellowing down and sobering transformation. The question of whether India or China wins or loses from the latest shake-up in Sri Lankan politics is not just crucial to strategists in New Delhi, Beijing, and Washington. It also matters to ordinary Sri Lankan people. The real issue is how India and China figure in the context of the two big domestic structural impediments bedeviling Sri Lanka— authoritarianism and majoritarianism. If Sri Lanka has to break out of the vicious cycle of political instability derived from its abusive and discriminatory state structure, only closeness to India can prod it in a progressive direction. As to the economic benefits which China brings with its deep pockets, it is apparent to most Sri Lankans that they are already caught in a ‘debt trap’ and in danger of ending up in servitude to Beijing. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, the arc of Sri Lanka’s moral universe is long, but it ultimately must bend towards India.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint," Debayan Dutta  Sandeep Suman Congress President Rahul Gandhi and TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu gave a message of Opposition unity on Thursday, 1 November, as the two held a meeting at the former’s residence in New Delhi with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in mind. Calling the meeting a ""good"" one, Gandhi said its agenda was defending democracy and the future of the country. Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu underlined the “democratic compulsion to unite.” Accompanied by TDP MPs Jayadev Galla, CM Ramesh and others, Naidu is said to have discussed an alliance for the 7 December Assembly elections in Telangana with Rahul Gandhi, as well as the agenda for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. According to TDP sources cited by PTI, the two parties are engaged in seat-sharing talks for the Assembly elections. The meeting between Gandhi and Naidu came minutes after the latter met NCP leader Sharad Pawar and National Conference (NC) President Farooq Abdullah. These meetings step up the efforts to build a pan-India Opposition alliance to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Addressing the media after the meeting with Abdullah and Pawar, Naidu said the three leaders met to discuss the possibility of an alliance between “anti-BJP” parties and thus “chalk out” a plan for the future. Stressing upon the “deteriorating” state of the country, Naidu said: Naidu also added that the three leaders want to bring in Rahul Gandhi to discuss the issue with him. Pawar and Abdullah, who were also present for the press briefing, said the leaders are working together to save the democracy and that they will collectively talk to other leaders for the same cause. Alluding to the crisis within the CBI and RBI, Abdullah said, “The country is going through difficult times and the nation is going though a great crisis. Today, democracy is in danger and we need to save the democracy, the nation and our institutions.” The meetings on Thursday come after Naidu met BSP chief Mayawati, Farooq Abdullah and former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in Delhi on 27 October. TDP sources cited by PTI further said that Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav spoke to Naidu over the phone on Wednesday and the latter will visit Delhi every week to speed up the process of uniting opposition parties. The TDP chief is said to be playing the role of a ""facilitator"" to bring together all opposition parties to stop the BJP juggernaut in the 2019 general elections.

Arun Dev,"In a surprise move, 48 hours before the by-election to three Lok Sabha and two Assembly constituencies in Karnataka, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate for Ramanagara (Assembly seat), L Chandrashekar, quit the party and withdrew his candidature. Chandrashekar, who had joined the BJP three days before the submission of nominations, has now returned to the party and announced his support for JD(S) candidate Anitha Kumaraswamy. In a statement to the media, Chandrashekar cited infighting in the BJP as the reason for his resignation from the party. “No one supported me in BJP in Ramanagara. In the last two days, no leaders have contacted me. Yesterday (Wednesday) I even tried calling Yeddyurappa but he didn't want to talk to me. I am backing out from polls,” he said. In April 2017, when the by-elections were announced in Nanjangud and Gundlupet, two Assembly constituencies in Old Mysore region, Congress was certain of a win. The Janata Dal Secular (JDS), which holds sway over the region dominated by Vokkaliga voters decided not to contest the polls citing lack of funds and the BJP didn’t have a strong base in the region to pose a threat to the Congress. As expected, the Congress won the by-election. But just over a year later, in 2018 Assembly elections, the BJP won both Nanjangud and Gundlupet. According to the party, during the 2017 by-election, the party had managed to increase its influence in the region. The bypolls in 2018 had once again presented the BJP with an opportunity to spread its influence in the region. The Old Mysore region includes Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Ramanagara, Bengaluru Rural, Kolar, Chickballapur, Tumakuru, and Hassan districts. In 2008, the BJP vote share in the region was around 21 percent. In 2013, it dropped to 8 percent after the tall leader of the party, BS Yeddyurappa, left the BJP to form Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP). In the 2018 Assembly election however, the BJP’s vote share increased to 18 percent and the party ensured it had an MLA in all districts of the region except Mandya. The BJP recorded 18 percent vote share when the election was a three-party contest. As the Congress is not contesting next week’s by-election in the region, the BJP was hoping for a larger chunk of the vote share. The big trump card for the BJP was the defection of Congress leader L Chandrashekar. As the Congress has decided support JD (S) candidate CM’s wife Anitha Kumaraswamy, disgruntled Chandrashekar had defected to the BJP and was fielded as the candidate against Anitha Kumaraswamy. For the BJP, which lacks the second-rung of Vokkaliga leaders – the dominant community in the region – defections of the leaders like Chandrashekar was an opportunity to create a leadership in the region. But with Chandrashekar’s exit, the BJP’s ambitions in the region have taken a big hit. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Arun Dev,"Hoisting the Karnataka state flag on the day of the Kannada Rajyotsava – the state formation day – has been a tradition in Karnataka since the formation of the state. Although unofficial, the successive chief ministers hoisted red and yellow flag. This yellow and red flag, which came from the days of struggle for the formation of a united Karnataka, was considered the state flag for several decades even though it had no legal status. As the state government had no powers to give legal status to a flag, in March 2018, the state government had sent a proposal to make the tricolours the official state flag. This proposal is still pending with the central government. Neither the committee which proposed the new flag, nor the government, has written to the centre following up on the proposal. The central government said they would look into the legality of the state’s claim. By then, however, the election was announced in Karnataka and the proposal was shelved. R Jayamala, minister for Kannada and Culture and senior JD(S) leaders too claimed they would write to the central government soon, but no deadline was given for the communication. Even for Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, the flag is a topic of dilemma. Before forming the coalition government with the Congress, Kumaraswamy, a JD(S) leader, had opposed the idea of a new flag. During the election campaign, he had   there is no provision in the Constitution for a state flag. “The Congress government is using this issue to divert attention from some recent controversies,” he was quoted as saying before the elections. But after forming the coalition government with the Congress party, Kumaraswamy had promised that all the programmes started by the previous Congress party will be continued. “The flag was used as an election tactics by the Congress party, so it is not really popular scheme affecting several lives,” said JD(S) cabinet minister. “But it is the Chief Minister’s decision,” he added. While the confusion over which flag will be used was building up, on Wednesday, a tweet from the Chief Minister indicated that the government may go with the old flag. In the tweet announcing postponement of the Rajyothsava awards due to the by-election, the Chief Minister’s office used a photo of the old flag, indicating the same flag may be used on the state formation day.

The News Minute,"Former Karnataka Chief Minister and BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa took strong exception to tainted mining baron and former ministerial colleague Gali Janardhana Reddy’s statement about the death of ex-CM Siddaramaiah’s son Rakesh. Following the statement, Yeddyurappa had on Wednesday, 31 October, asked Janardhana Reddy to apologise for his unsavoury remarks. Reacting to the statement, Yeddyurappa told reporters, “What Reddy said is unacceptable and no one should make such personal comments against political opponents. Reddy should apologise to Siddaramaiah.” In an interview with a TV news channel on Tuesday, the mining baron said, “He made me languish in jail for four-and-a-half years, keeping me away from my family and children. This is the reason why god punished him (Siddaramaiah) by taking away his son.” Rakesh, Siddaramaiah’s eldest son, died in Belgium in July 2016 after a multi-organ failure. He was suffering from pancreatic ailment and was admitted in the Antwerp University Hospital in Brussel. Later on Wednesday, Janaradhana Reddy speaking to another TV channel, said, “I did not intend to hurt Siddaramaiah, I was emotional when I spoke. I regret whatever said about Siddaramaiah and I apologise if I have hurt him.” Commenting on the issue, Siddaramaiah called Reddy “uncultured” and said, “Forgiveness is a quality of a human being. But a man with a criminal brain has no culture. Criticising political opponents is okay in politics, but not the family.” Later on social media, Siddaramaiah said, “Reddy has said that my son’s death is a punishment given to me by god. I pray to god to not punish your [Reddy’s] children for your sins.” Janardhana Reddy is again in the limelight as his protege B Sriramulu’s sister Shanta has been pitted against the Congress’s Ugurappa in the November 3 Ballari Lok Sabha by-polls. Although Reddy is banned from entering the mining heartland as per court orders, political observers say he is remotely organising party workers from his residence in Molkamuru in neighbouring Chitradurga district even though the BJP publicly disowns him.

Ashok K Mehta,"A friend and guide in the Sri Lanka military, of my days with the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF), who I asked, what to make of the current political upheaval in Colombo replied, “Politics and military are like a game of cricket. Once an umpire says ‘out’, you do not challenge that decision. You go back to the pavilion gracefully. Sri Lanka’s military is apolitical. If any party tries to use violence, the military will react. His Excellency, the President, is our Defence Minister and C in C.’’ I have intimately known Sri Lanka’s military and researched in-depth the mettle of the security forces which transformed itself from a ceremonial force to one that routed the LTTE. The services are politicised and there is a reason for it. The Army has been deeply involved along with the police and CID in suppressing insurgency and insurrection in the north and south of the country for over three decades. There was no concept of cantonments per se to isolate it, and the military was involved in the maintenance of law and order, as well as public order. For example, in 1956, the ‘Sinhala Only’ bill led to widespread riots and the cumulative effects of that resulted in the first abortive coup in 1962, Operation Holdfast. It was called the Colonels’ Coup which was led by 24 Christian officers led by Col Frederick Saram. It represented a battle between the old and new elites, the angst of Sandhurst-trained Anglophiles against the Sinhalisation of the military initiated by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In Sri Lanka, this foul coup is sometimes recalled by the media. The second failed coup was in 1966, the proximate cause being the defeat of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and her successor, Dudley Senanayake’s efforts in rolling back pro-Sinhalese reforms. The plot was nipped in the bud, although two arrested personnel committed suicide and others were tried in court and acquitted. Maj Denzil Kobbekaduwa (later Lieutenant General and killed by an LTTE landmine) was sent on compulsory leave. Senior Army officers have generally been associated with either SLFP or UNP. In the year 2000, a general officer was being made out of turn Army Commander but it was thwarted by the Opposition. He was sent to Australia as an ambassador instead.  President Maithripala Sirisena, while addressing the nation on 28 and 29 October 2018, speaking to a 100-odd MPs after reunification of SLFP, said the main reason for appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as PM was due to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s (a minister in ousted Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government) name surfacing in a CID inquiry about an alleged assassination plot targeting him and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the new PM’s brother. The CID enquiry as it has unfolded in Sri Lankan media, appears rather convoluted. But investigations are continuing. Sirisena, when a common candidate while fighting Rajapaksa in 2015 presidential election, had then accused him of trying to kill him. Rewind to February 2010 – ten months after the triumphant victory over the LTTE whose key architects are President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Defence Secretary Colonel Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Army Commander, Gen Sarath Fonseka. In 2010, Fonseka dared to contest the 2010 presidential election against President Rajapaksa, and duly lost. Fonseka was arrested, court-martialled and jailed. 15 officers including five Generals and two Brigadiers loyal to Fonseka were sacked and murmurs of unrest in the army had started. There were even reports of India/RAW supporting Fonseka. A sub plot of this political theatre was the historic hatred and rivalry between Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Fonseka, originating from their time in the Army. Gotabhaya was seen to have written the script for the disgrace and internment of Fonseka. It is said that fortune favours the brave. When Sirisena became president, Fonseka was resurrected, restored his rank, medals, honour and promoted to Field Marshal. The current Army Commander, a courageously brave officer, Gen Mahesh Senanayake, one of the five Generals sacked, was brought back after five years and is on his first extension. There are others who were reinstated, including a navy commander. If Rajapaksa is confirmed as prime minister, some of the officers may feel insecure which will include the incumbent Army Chief.  As for Fonseka, he will have to prove himself to be the proverbial cat with a dozen lives. Will Sirisena, who salvaged his military legacy and made him Field Marshal, now have to act against him, especially now that Gotabhaya’s name has been dragged along with his own? These are turbulent times in Sri Lanka whose political history is being re-written to ensure Sirisena becomes president for a second time and the Rajapaksas are rehabilitated. In many ways, this is replay of the past: internecine domestic political warfare, dragging in the military.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

While universities in Delhi, Kerala and West Bengal are known for being hotbeds of political activism, campus politics in Mumbai has been a low-key affair historically, barring the phase in the late 1980s that saw spiralling violence between student unions, which led to campus elections being banned in the state.

Judith Kelley,"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE,  international election observers to the 2018 US midterm election. American voters may be surprised to learn such visits are routine. In fact, this will be the seventh such visit since 2002. This year, with the ongoing Mueller probe about election meddling and concerns about cyber security, the election observers are likely to encounter a growing climate of distrust among US voters about elections and the voting process. As I describe in my book “ ,” international election observers are representatives from intergovernmental organisations or nongovernmental organisations from other countries. They monitor elections during the pre-election period, on election day and during the post-election period. The OSCE, created in 1972, is one of the most active groups that monitors elections around the world. All 57 member states, including the US, have agreed to allow the OSCE to monitor their elections. Election monitoring has grown dramatically since the end of the Cold War. At first, election monitors focused on emerging democracies such as those in Eastern Europe. But in an effort to be more egalitarian, observation missions to established democracies such as the United States have become common. Monitoring teams usually fan out across the country and compile their observations into national reports. They make recommendations not only about the conduct of the polling, but also about the electoral system and the political environment more broadly. In the 2016 general US elections, OSCE observers   of voting, but raised concerns about the candidates’ campaigns using “harsh personal attacks.” They also noted voting rights were denied to some citizens, due to “recent legal changes and decisions on technical aspects of the electoral process [that] were often motivated by partisan interests.” Some of the OSCE recommendations have been addressed. For example, the 2018 pre-election assessment noted that “there is an emerging trend among states to ease restrictions on the restoration of voting rights for ex-prisoners, in line with prior OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights recommendations.” Still, two years later, many of the concerns from the 2016 report remain. In June 2018, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights   concerns about “voter rights, registration and identification, security of election technologies, alternative voting methods, campaign finance, and the conduct of the electoral campaign, particularly online and in the media.” Traditional voter fraud, such as impersonation at the polls,  . Instead, Americans are worried about   and disenfranchisement – voters having their ballots disqualified or being prevented or discouraged from voting at all. For example,  , arguing that a voter registration law requiring an “exact match” between a registration form and voter’s existing identification suppressed minority votes.   rising rates of voter registration purges have raised concerns that people – again mostly minority voters – might be removed without justification. And in other states   leads some voters to think their votes are unimportant, because even large changes in the votes a party receives can lead to no change in the number of seats that party wins. , as well as that of others, has found that   can – under some conditions – lead to improvements in conduct and quality of elections. However, this year’s mission to the US will be small. The 2016 US general election had 400 observers. Because it is a midterm election, the 2018 mission will feature only 13 international experts in Washington, DC, plus 36 observers who will go to locations throughout the country. The observers also are limited in where they can go. Although all OSCE member nations are obligated to allow observers to visit their elections,   the presence of international observers. This is possible because election laws are made at the state level in the United States, and states have varied preferences. Instead, these states only allow   from their own state. Meanwhile, the   to strike down parts of the Voting Rights Act has reduced domestic election oversight. Previously, the federal Department of Justice had to review proposed election law changes in 15 states – in whole or in part – where history suggests racial discrimination might occur. Many, but not all, of the supervised jurisdictions were in the South. While the United States has been on the forefront of sending various observer missions to other countries, the OSCE is the only serious group that conducts international election observation in the United States. With such a small mission, their influence will be limited. As a result, their presence and insights are likely to remain, as they have in past US elections, largely under the radar, stimulating discussion mostly among insiders. Still, such discussion can be valuable to signal to other countries that the US is willing to hold itself accountable for its electoral integrity. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Bridging India’s ties with Maldives, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to be a part of oath taking ceremony of new President-elect Ibrahim Mahmood Solih in November. In what has been referred to as “positive signals” by New Delhi, has reported that the inaugural ceremony committee in Male have confirmed a possible bilateral meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the event. While a source close to Solih told  that an official invite is being processed through diplomatic channels, officials in the National Capital have confirmed an on-going dialogue between India and Maldives on the visit alongside. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, 24 September, called on Maldives' new President-elect Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and congratulated him on his victory in the presidential elections held in Maldives on Sunday. Modi also conveyed his good wishes for the strengthening of democracy, peace and prosperity in the island nation under the leadership of Solih, who thanked him for his greetings. The two leaders agreed to work together closely to further strengthen the relations between the two countries. India's ties with Maldives came under strain after Yameen declared Emergency in the country on February 5, following an order by the country's Supreme Court to release a group of Opposition leaders, who had been convicted in widely criticised trials. The Emergency was lifted 45 days later. In July, India had expressed concern over the presidential election and urged the Yameen government to allow its democratic institutions, including the Parliament and the judiciary, to function in a free and transparent manner. Former Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom described India as the ""closest and most trusted ally"" of Maldives, he said it was in the interests of all of the Maldives' geographical neighbours that there is stability in the Indian Ocean region. ""I am confident that the new government will work towards achieving this. We will be sensitive towards the concerns of India as well as of other friends,"" he said, adding Maldives was looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Maldives ""very soon"". Both India and China, jostling for influence in the Indian Ocean, had been watching the election closely. The Maldives' economy, historically tied to its famed luxury tourism sector, grew under Yameen, in part due to aid and investment from China. Notably, Yameen has been considered to be backed by China. Beijing has invested in major projects in Maldives and a free trade agreement also exists between the two countries,  BBC. The analysts cited by BBC before the election said that while China favoured incumbency in the Maldives, as it favoured its interests, India rooted for an opposition win. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment by AP regarding the election on Monday, a public holiday. Former joint opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih came out victorious in the 23 September presidential election, handing a shock defeat to incumbent Yameen and capping months of political upheaval in the tourist paradise. The political turmoil was triggered by imposition of emergency in February and jailing of several of opposition leaders including Gayoom, a half brother of Yameen. Yameen had challenged the outcome of the elections, alleging the vote was rigged but the country's Supreme Court upheld the results. The transition of power is due on 17 November.

Akanksha Kumar,"Puneet Bhatia Abhay Sharma The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has recommended that the UP government pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation to paralysed gym trainer Jitendra Yadav’s family. In a   dated 30 October 2018, the NHRC stated that ‘a case of violation of human rights of the victim is made out’.   had met with Jitendra and his family earlier and is re-publishing this story from its archives. The story first appeared on 16 October 2018. For 26-year-old Jitendra Yadav from Noida’s Parthala Khanjarpur, life came to a standstill on the night of 3 February 2018. An altercation with a sub-inspector and three other constables resulted in a bullet being fired that pierced through Jitendra’s neck, damaging his spinal cord. Since the last eight months, Jitendra has been confined to his bed as he became a paraplegic after the incident in February. Unable to move his lower limbs, Jitendra misses going to his gym where he used to train young boys in bodybuilding. Recalling the chain of events, Jitendra explained how he became a victim of an alleged fake encounter: According to Jitendra’s narrative, a brawl between him, his friends and the policemen took an ugly turn when arguments led to fisticuffs with the sub-inspector taking out his pistol in a fit of rage. While the sub-inspector was arrested on charges of attempt to murder and robbery, two constables and a trainee sub-inspector were  . But for Jitendra, who needs at least three people to hold him from behind before he can sit straight, the action by UP police is of little help. Daily routine of physiotherapy sessions along with regular medical check-ups is costing Jitendra Rs 1-1.5 lakh per month. Jitendra’s gym has been closed after the incident in February. For someone who used to earn Rs 70,000-80,000 monthly, paralysis of lower limbs means loss of his only means of livelihood. This means that Jitendra’s father, who’s a farmer, now has to bear all the medical and household expenses. Instead of a dumbbell set, it’s a pair of crutches that adorns Jitendra’s room these days. And it’s an elastic belt with rods attached that acts like a jacket from his waist downwards up to his feet – an external aid that helps Jitendra stand when supported from behind by his physiotherapist. While we were talking to Jitendra, a plastic container underneath his bed, into which urine is emptied from the bag daily, tumbled with its smell suddenly filling the entire room. An embarrassed Jitendra screamed at his helper who rushed in with a mop and a bottle of liquid Dettol. For someone who would bask in the glory of six packs, his waste flowing out in the open was perhaps way too shameful. It is the silence and grim faces of family members that strikes you on entering Jitendra’s house in Parthala Khanjarpur village, an hour away from Delhi, in Noida. In a room adjoining the courtyard, his father Nepal Singh lies in a cot with a glucose drip being administered through his right hand. Shock and exhaustion have taken a toll on Nepal Singh, who has no hopes from the Yogi Adityanath government. Talking about the recent killing of Apple executive   by a constable in Lucknow, Jitendra’s father says that the UP government has turned a blind eye towards them because they are Yadavs. Nepal Singh claims that all his attempts of reaching out to UP’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were in vain as he was denied access every time. According to the information provided by UP police earlier this year, more than 1,100 police encounters have been reported in the state between March 2017 and January 2018. Jitendra is another victim of the shooting spree by the UP police that doesn’t seem to think twice before aiming a gun at civilians these days. Jitendra’s family has now resorted to social media for seeking financial help for his medical treatment. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Speaking to the reporters in Madurai, Dhinakaran said the MLAs are ready to face the by-elections to the 20 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. Responding to a remark made by the ruling AIADMK that the MLAs who sided with the AMMK chief would lose their deposit if they contest in elections, Dhinakaran said, “They said the same thing even during RK Nagar by-polls (where TTV Dhinakaran won by defeating the AIADMK and the DMK candidates). The AIADMK would be the one who would be fighting to retain deposit in the constituencies. AMMK will win a huge victory in all 20 constituencies.” The announcement comes a week after Madras High Court ruled that the decision of the speaker of the TN Assembly to disqualify the 18 MLAs was valid. The ruling was delivered by Justice M Sathyanarayanan, the third judge in the case, which saw a split verdict in August. The move by the Dhinakaran camp comes two days after the ruling AIADMK announced a list of Ministers who would be personally overseeing the 20 by-poll constituencies for the party. Speaker P Dhanapal disqualified the 18 AIADMK MLAs on 18 September under the Anti-Defection Act. The MLAs, who were supporting ousted AIADMK Deputy General Secretary, now AMMK leader and RK Nagar MLA TTV Dhinakaran, were disqualified on the grounds that they had “voluntarily given up their party membership”. “The six-month period to conduct an election to the vacant assembly constituencies gets over in January only in two constituencies -- Tirupparankundram and Thiruvarur. Whenever the elections are going to be held for 20 constituencies, we will win a huge victory,” he said.

With campaign for assembly elections in five states underway and the Lok Sabha polls less than six months away, he stressed on his development plank during a video interaction with BJP workers, asking them to go to people with a three-point agenda – development, fast development and development for all. To a question from a worker as to how they should respond to opposition leaders' ""abuses"" like calling him a scorpion – an apparent reference to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's recent remarks, Modi said they were offering him what they had. He was glad, the prime minister said, that he was of any use to them as it allows them to vent their anger and spend their time ""happily"" with their family members in evening. Modi, however, made fun of Gandhi when a party worker asked him as to how they should respond to the Congress president's comments in his rallies that there should be mobile manufacturing factories in the areas he visits. These people don't know that time has changed and they should not treat people as fools, Modi said, adding that nobody accepts such childish remarks. People make fun of it, he said. Modi also targeted Gandhi without naming him over his recent criticism of the central government on the issue of OROP (One Rank One Pension) for ex-servicemen. Since his government has implemented it so his rivals were concerned over ex-servicemen's ""love"" for him and repeating ""lies after lies"", he said. Modi claimed that ""lies"" of Congress leaders against the BJP and its governments on certain issues indicated his dispensation's success as he referred to his ""digital India"" campaign which, he added, had made lives easier for crores of people by letting them avail of government benefits sitting at home. Opposition leaders offered him abuses as this is what they had, he said, exhorting BJP workers to spread the ""qualities"" the party is known for – love, hard work and sacrifice. He asked BJP workers in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan to inform the masses about the development works the party's government had done in these states and also told them to remind the people about the poor governance when the opposition was in power. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the two states where the BJP has been in power for 15 years, are no longer ""bimaru"" (sick) states, he said, adding that all the three states have reached new heights of development under the party's rule. He also asked the party's workers to run a campaign asking people to donate anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 1,000 to the BJP through the Narendra Modi app. Modi described the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which he had inaugurated in Gujarat earlier in the day, as a work that will make coming generations proud. The current generation may not evaluate it, he said, adding that people now appreciate the enormity of Patel's work of uniting the country at a time when quarrels erupt over small issues such as language and food.

Atanu Dey,"The Sardar Patel statue, also called ‘The Statue of Unity’, unveiled on 31 October, is the biggest statue in the world at 182 metres tall. Built at the cost of about Rs 3,000 crore, it must be impressive to behold because of its sheer size. It is supposed to represent the unity of the nation and be a tribute to a great man who united India. Maybe that’s so. But to me, it represents the power that those in government use to force people to do their bidding. Certainly, it’s not the worst form of naked tyranny, like marching people off to the gulags to be worked until they die – but it is something that reasonable leaders of a free people should never do. It is a shameful display of gigantic ego and a misuse of power. To be clear, my argument is not about alternative uses that Rs 3,000 crore could have been put to. That amount could have helped, for instance, 300,000 families climb out of extreme poverty. But that’s not the substance of my objection. You can always find alternatives uses for any expenditure. It is then just a matter of differing opinions and preferences. My objection is not about   the money was spent on. My objection is about   the money for the project was obtained. Regarding the financing of the project, a   report says: The fact is that the government of Gujarat and and the central government of India partly financed the project. That means taxes collected from citizens were used. In other words, a significant portion of the funding was obtained through coercion and force. To put it bluntly, it was taken at the point of a gun, and on threat of violence. Just to be clear, taxes always involve the use or the threat of the use of force. The government dictates how much you owe in taxes; if you don’t pay, you are threatened with jail and/or the confiscation of your property; if you resist, you are restrained or killed. The process may initially appear all very civilised and lawful but ultimately it is you (usually unarmed) against the (heavily armed) government. You cannot win that contest. The end – of building a humongous statue of a great man who was supposedly for freedom and justice – does not come close to justifying the means, the threat and use of force. As is the norm in matters such as the building of pyramids, or the Taj Mahal and other impressive monuments to human vanity and the lust for power, Modi will be celebrated as the person who built the Statue of Unity. Truth is, he did not. Ordinary Indians toiled to earn a living; part of that income was taken away by force (at the point of a gun, if necessary), and was spent on Sardar’s statue. Millions of extremely poor people paid unknowingly or unwillingly, out of their very meager earnings, the money to build the statue. It is shameful. Modi should be ashamed. I don’t think Sardar Patel would have approved of this misuse of power. There are two distinct ways of getting people to do something. One is to persuade them somehow. If you succeed, people act willingly. Persuasion leads to consensual behavior. It is the mark of a civilised society that people persuade each other and cooperate to attain mutually beneficial goals. This is most evident in free markets, where people persuade and cooperate, buy and sell. It’s an enterprise which involves no force because all transactions are voluntarily entered into. The other way to get people to do your bidding is to use power. Thugs and bullies use power, not persuasion. Governments use power, not persuasion. Power is their only instrument. That’s why governments of civilised nations are constrained by the constitution to a limited set of activities. Narendra Modi, as an individual and a citizen, could have used persuasion to build the Sardar Patel statue. He could have said, Not just Indian citizens, I am sure that people around the world who care about India would have willingly contributed to that project. Instead, Modi as the prime minister decided that Indians will not willingly fund the statue. So he used the power of the state to extract the money from people. I don’t know what’s more shameful: the low opinion that Modi appears to have of Indians, or the idea that he’s morally justified in using force to make people do his bidding. That the government uses force to extract money to boost its image is par for the course. What’s really distressing is that the people of India find it acceptable and even praiseworthy. It shows that the people have lost their independence, their pride, their ability to reason, to make their own choices, to be their own masters. Big statues are certain to impress, but ultimately, they don’t matter. The big picture is about the prosperity of the people, which depends to a great degree on good governance. We have the big statues, but poor governance. In the end, we must remember that gigantism is a pathology. It is not normal. It appears that the only thing more gigantic than the statue,is Modi’s ego.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Akanksha Kumar,"A fact-finding committee constituted by the Delhi Minorities Commission has raised questions on the NIA probe in the Palwal mosque case. In a press conference on 31 October 2018, the committee released its report countering allegations by the NIA of terror funding in the construction of the Khulafa-e-Rashideen masjid at Uttawar in Palwal. On 25 September, the NIA (National Investigation Agency) had conducted raids at various places in Delhi and arrested three persons, namely, Mohammad Salman, Mohd Salim and Sajjad Abdul Wani. In its  country’s premier investigation agency stated that it had “busted Falah-e-Insaniyat (FIF) terror funding module”. The Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) is a front-end organisation closely linked with 26/11 attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed. Days later, the NIA conducted raids at Khulafa-e-Rashideen masjid where Salman was the designated Imam. The NIA   that Salman had allegedly received Rs 70 lakh from FIF, which was diverted towards the construction of the mosque. According to the fact-finding committee that had gone to Palwal on 20 October, construction of the mosque began in 2009. Residents of 84 villages had helped in raising money; some had even helped with bricks, and construction material as a gesture of charity. Recalling their conversation with Akhtar Hussain, former  (village head) of Uttawar village, the panel members told the media that the Masjid Committee had “receipts of about Rs 1 crore” but “all the records including receipts and registers in original were taken by NIA”. Speaking to  , Ovais Sultan, an activist and member of the fact-finding committee stated that ‘nowhere be it in press releases or statement, the NIA has not been able to establish link between masjid and terror funding’. Ovais further claims that there have been ‘procedural lapses in the whole episode’. Elaborating on the procedural lapses, the fact-finding committee told the media that a seizure memo had not been given to Mohd Salman’s family when raids were conducted at his house in Delhi. Similarly no seizure memo was given to the Masjid Committee members after confiscating all the original receipts, records, diaries and registers. Speaking to  , Abubakr Sabbaq, human rights lawyer and member of the fact finding committee said that ‘due procedure of seizure were not followed by the NIA’. Under section 100 of the CrPc, when a search is conducted by the police, a list of all things taken possession of needs to be prepared and handed over to such person. The fact that the NIA has not handed over a seizure memo leaves space for manipulation and falsifcation of evidence. ‘It is the politics of polarisation being played by the NIA’, said Sabbaq as he raised doubts on the motive behind dragging the mosque into the row. The two press releases by NIA in connection with the FIF module dated   and   do not mention the name of Khulafa-e-Rashideen masjid.

According to Salman’s son, his father received a call from UCO Bank at Bhogal where he has a bank account. Salman’s family claims that he was abducted from outside the bank. The panel that had interacted with Salman’s family also found out that he had sold his ancestral land and donated Rs 20 lakh to the mosque which contradicts NIA’s claim of Salman diverting Rs 70 lakh for the same. The fact finding committee also quoted local police personnel, Deputy SP Suresh Kumar and SHO Ram Dayal, who told the panel they had ‘never received any complaint or intelligence input regarding any anti national activity in the region’.

"Ira Dugal, BloombergQuint","Amidst the public glare on differences between the government and the Reserve Bank of India, the Finance Ministry on Wednesday, 31 October, issued a statement saying that the autonomy of the central bank is essential “within the framework of the RBI Act.” The statement, which  that the government may initiate consultations under a never-used provision that allows it to direct the central bank in “public interest”, did little to address the differences that have emerged on key policy matters. All the government said in its statement was that both the central bank and the government must be guided by “public interest.” The statement went on to add that extensive consultations take place between the government and the RBI from time to time. The subject matter of these consultations is not made public and only final decisions are communicated, said the Finance Ministry. The statement from the government is very bland, columnist and author TCA Srinivasa Raghavan told BloombergQuint, reacting to the development. “The government couldn't have said anything more or anything less. All that they have said is that we consult with these institutions and we will continue to do so. It’s a very bland statement.” Still, the statement helped calm the  to some extent. The rupee which had been trading sharply weaker since the morning, rebounded from the day’s low in response to the government’s comments. The “terse” statement was welcome, because the expectation was a worst-case outcome, said Ananth Narayan, associate professor (finance) at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research. “We should have never gotten to this point, this is a situation that we can do without,” Narayan, a veteran watcher of the Indian markets told BloombergQuint. The issues that have cropped up between the RBI and the government range from banking regulation to payment systems and the central bank balancesheet. Neither the government nor the RBI has signaled any thaw of any of these specific issues yet. These issues were detailed in a   Viral Acharya in a speech on Friday, which, in many ways, brought the differences between the RBI and the government into the public domain. A recent suggestion to create a payment regulator outside the purview of the Reserve Bank has also been opposed by the RBI. In a dissent note, the RBI said that regulation of payment systems is central to the functions of a central bank. Experts that BloombergQuint spoke to said that the debate over the reserves and capital of the RBI is the most serious of the issues being debated right now. “The government wants comfort on fiscal deficit, RBI wants to maintain sufficient reserves,” said V. Anantha Nageswaran, Dean at IFMR Business School. Ananth Narayan noted that while there may be a case to argue that the RBI is sitting on excess capital, the issue has to be debated extensively before any decision. “While we are speculating, it appears that the issue that broke the camel’s back is the RBI’s reserves....One of the sad things would be if we try to do something without having enough debate about this,” said Ananth Narayan while adding that the financial markets will see through any attempt to fill the fiscal hole using RBI’s reserves. While a number of specific issues have cropped up between the central bank and the government, an over-arching problem has also been the break down of communications between the two sides. TCA Srinivasa Raghavan took a similar view. “I have no idea to what extent this is about the issues and to what extent there are major egos involved. It’s very hard to say,” he said while recalling the back and forth that would go on over interest rates between former RBI Governor D. Subbarao and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram. “The government should refrain from airing such differences publicly and, of course, that goes the other way around as well,” said Mohan while adding that he is not privy to the provocations that led the RBI to come out so publicly. “I do hope that saner heads will prevail.

Debasish Bhattacharyya,"Amid the raging debate in India on the impact of economic growth on employment generation, it is pertinent to raise two questions. One, whether joblessness aggravated social unrest and economic imbalance, and two, whether there are no jobs, or job-seekers lack the skills and qualifications needed to for specific jobs? The answer is a combination of both. However, there is little doubt that persistent unemployment has led to a rising sense of despair, disaffection, despondency among the diverse younger generation across the country. The situation is best reflected in the words of British historian Thomas Carlyle, “A man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune’s inequality exhibits under this sun.” The Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) found that there are about 31 million unemployed youth in India as of February 2018. According to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) survey findings, more than 30 percent of Indians in the 15 to 29 years age group are neither in employment nor in education and training. Even the International Labour Organisation (ILO) report ‘World Employment and Social Outlook Trend – 2018’ projected that the number of unemployed persons in India is expected to rise from 18.6 million in 2018 to 18.9 million by 2019, making it the home of 10 percent of the world's jobless people. Thus, the collective reflection of all this data displays little or no strategic vision for reducing unemployment. Put differently, it demonstrates the consequences of past inaction or inadequate quality interventions, or both. To compound the issue, what is truly baffling is the idea of ‘gainful employment’ for 460 million Indian workers that focuses on improved quality of work and the income derived from it. Boosting the employment status of young adults and helping employers meet labour force demands, are complementary goals. Drawing up strategies to realise them requires divergent thinking, critical evaluation, introspection and clarity. To improve outcomes both for young adults and businesses, the stakeholders like the government, employers and educational institutions need to shore up and make changes on both the supply and demand sides of the labour market. Government schemes like ‘Skill India’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme’ (PMGEP), ‘Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana’, and ‘Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana’ aimed at more fulfilling, more rewarding, and more productive work for our workforce, are significant, but there have been no green shoots yet. And it’s worrisome as apparently 90 percent of India’s labour force – primarily low-skilled or unskilled – are employed in the nation’s informal economy. Worrisome still is the UNESCO report stating that India will achieve universal primary education by 2050, universal lower secondary education in 2060, and universal upper secondary education in 2085. Thus, it’s all the more important to go for concerted efforts to deal with the country’s low-skill intensity and low-education attainment, to make a skill-scarce pool productive. Given the urgency of the situation, here is what we can do: These are only some ways in which we can help alleviate India’s unemployment problem. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On Wednesday, Parrikar is expected to chair a meeting of the state cabinet, which would be the first such meeting after August. Parrikar, who has not made a public appearance since his return from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on 14 October, met the members of the board that included several cabinet ministers, industrialists and other officials at the meeting which lasted more than an hour. A photograph released by the state Bharatiya Janata Party, showed a bare-footed Parrikar wearing his trademark half-sleeved shirt and dark blue trousers with other members of the board alongside him. Over the last couple of days, opposition Congress has demanded a video or photographic proof of the Chief Minister's well-being. Parrikar, who is currently being treated for advanced pancreatic cancer, has been in and out of hospitals in Goa, Mumbai, New York and Delhi. His absence has created a leadership vacuum in Goa, even as the opposition has demanded that he step aside to focus on treatment. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Srishti Tyagi,"Delhi's air continued to remain in the ""very poor"" category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 348 on Monday, 29 October. Both residents and tourists are subjected to the poor air quality whenever they step out of their homes. According to CPCB, the severe AQI affects even healthy people if exposed for a long time, while it seriously impacts those with existing diseases. Among the most polluted regions in Delhi were Dwarka, Anand Vihar, Rohini, Mundaka, Bawana, Mathura Raod, Delhi Technical University, Jahangirpuri, Narela, Nehru Nagar, Delhi University North Campus, Punjabi Bagh, RK Puram, Sonia Vihar, Vivek Vihar and Wazirpur. Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Monday, 29 October, asked the party-ruled municipal corporations to step in to tackle the rising air pollution in the city as the AAP government has ""failed"" to take effective measures. It is very unfortunate that the Delhi government only remains a ""mute spectator"" to this ""serious health hazard"" Delhi is facing, he alleged, adding that in the last four years, the AAP dispensation has ""failed"" to take any effective measure to curb air pollution.

S Irfan Habib,"Saif Mahmood’s   is about Delhi’s most well-known poets and I cannot claim to be one who has any expertise in the area. Another attraction for me was the author himself and his charming facility with both Urdu language as well as literature. Mahmood’s wit and aplomb is a treat which I have relished several times over the past few years. Obviously I avidly looked forward to this book since I came to know about it. This is not the first book about Delhi; there have been several authoritative works on the city by historians like Percival Spear and Narayani Gupta as well as by writers like Khushwant Singh and others. Even   was written by Dargah Quli Khan in the 18th century itself, giving graphic details of the politics and life of the city. In the early twentieth century, Bashiruddin Ahmad came out with a set of three impressive volumes called  However, none of them wrote the history of Delhi through the lives of its poets, as Mahmood does in this book. He covers almost two hundred years of history of Delhi from the eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. He goes through the eight complicated lives with lucidity and ease, keeping the reader informed and entertained throughout the book. It was a century of cultural and literary vibrancy, which continued to flourish despite the depleting and vanishing patronage. This century produced the masters of classical Urdu which includes awe-inspiring names like Sauda, Dard, Mir, Ghalib, Momin, Zafar, Zauq, and Daagh.   narrates their lives and poetry so vividly, and Mahmood weaves the portrait of the city in an elegant language with charm and erudition. The book begins with an insightful introduction, which actually sets the tone for the following chapters of the book. It helps the reader get the flavor of the unpredictable politics and life in the city. They appeared on the scene as de facto rulers, reducing the Mughal Emperor to the illusion of de jure sovereignty. The Mughal Emperor was virtually a pensioner of the British but was allowed to indulge in his poetry and even in expensive amusements till he did not pose a threat to the British authority. Yet, the Mughal Emperor's name was still required to give political legitimacy to the de facto power of the British. For the populace, the Emperor was still a shadow of God and the Refuge of the World. His birthday was still an occasion of state celebration and his recovery from sickness was still joyously welcomed at the functions of ceremonial ablutions – the  . There was a sizable section of the British as well, who were somewhat swept away by the encapsulating ambience, of the vibrant Urdu culture that seemed to mesh so effortlessly with the life-style of the Indian nobility. The British officers had little hang-ups in interacting on almost equal terms with the nobility, poets, intellectuals and merchants of the city of Delhi. Most of the Europeans lived in the rented houses in predominantly Indian localities like Daryaganj and Kashmiri Gate. It was very much unlike other presidency towns where a total racial segregation could be seen from the beginning itself. There was a discernible nativisation of the British, though culture, the umbilical cord with ‘home’ was assiduously preserved. Some notable figures in this category were men like Sir Thomas Metcalfe, British Resident in Delhi; Colonel James Skinner – born of a Scottish father and a Rajput mother – William Fraser, British resident in the 1830s and a friend of Ghalib; Sir David Ochterlony, known popularly as ‘Akhter loony’, twice resident of Delhi and many others. Thomas Metcalfe, had built a typical Indian  like mansion on the outskirts of the city, on the banks of the river Jamuna. He used to sit on the 'Chabootra' outside the house with his  , like any other Indian   of the time. Unfortunately, this heritage building is out of bounds today for the common people, being a DRDO office. Col Skinner's townhouse was at Kashmiri Gate, which, despite all its Anglican pretensions, had  in the Mughal Style and a Zenana perfectly 'native' in style. Some of these early British officials were well versed in Persian classics. Charles Metcalfe was one of them. William Fraser was as fluent in Persian and Arabic as any other native and had a good collection of books. A good number of them composed poetry in Persian and Urdu and even adopted   (pen name) such as Alexander Heatherly’s  , General Joseph Bensley’s  , George Puech’s   etc. So this was actually pre-1857 Delhi where the relationship with the British was more relaxed. The   and   continued to be organised and the patronage and encouragement to the poets still existed. As Mahmood rightly points out, these gatherings “soon became an important institution of Urdu literature, offering poets a secular space to not only showcase their poetic talent but also vent their anger and frustration with political, social and economic affairs.” However, we see that the secular space Mahmood talks about is being compromised most of the time. A   now invariably begins with   or a  , which is surely an innovation and also a reflection of the changing times. All those who rightly stress that Urdu is not the language of a particular community need to ponder about this branding. There is a general consensus that the Urdu language was born in the eighteenth century Muslim army camps. Mahmood debunks this theory through his meticulous research, convincing the reader that Urdu as a language has existed for centuries. Out of these eight lives, it is only Ghalib who sounds somewhat familiar to even those who have interest in Urdu poetry. Most others are truly revelations, at least their lives if not poetry. When life becomes unlivable and insecure in Delhi, Sauda migrates to Awadh and carries his sarcasm and satire along. Saif narrates a story which depicts the persona of Sauda for us. After hearing the continuous boasts of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula’s hunting of a lion, he sent a following couplet to him: It was a serious pun on Asaf-ud-Daula’s Shia faith where Ali is known as Sher-e-Khuda and Ibn-Muljim was his assassin. Thus, Sauda was not only fearless but also mischievous, and the “voice of the voiceless”. One of the beauties of this book is that Mahmood transports the reader back into the eighteenth/nineteenth centuries, and does that effortlessly. Mir Taqi Mir comes to Delhi in 1733 and lives in three localities – Kucha Chelan, Chandni Mahal and Matia Mahal. All three are still around but they are not the same as Mahmood so vividly describes. This is also an area where one of the uncles of Syed Ahmad Khan used to live, whose house was looked at with curiosity as it had strange objects hanging all over. They were actually astronomical instruments as he was an expert astronomer. Mir Taqi Mir often fell short of patrons in Delhi and finally had to create a sort of barter system to survive-writing a verse or two for the pharmacist if he needed medicine or do the same with a cloth merchant if needed to buy clothes. This book adds immensely to our awareness about Delhi and its colourful past. He writes about the history of the city as a storyteller, unburdened by the professional constraints of a historian. The book is a wonderful celebration of the city and its poets – both of whom seem to be lost in today’s all-encompassing cacophony. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TT Ram Mohan,"Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Viral Acharya created a stir last week with his strongly-worded   about the danger of governments undermining central banks. It was seen as a warning to the Modi government of the perils of encroaching on the RBI’s turf. A day later, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke in New Delhi. Without naming any institution, Jaitley asked, “Are we weakening the authority of the elected and creating a power shift in favour of non-accountables? Ultimately at the Centre or state, it’s only the elected who are accountable. The non-accountable are not accountable.” When it comes to choosing between politicians and technocrats, the intelligentsia would reflexively plumb for the latter. Technocrats are highly educated. They are suave in making their case. Most importantly, they are thought to be better capable of focusing on outcomes over the long-term instead of being guided by short-term considerations such as impending elections. The last proposition is not as self-evident as it seems. The corporate world is ruled by technocrats, often MBAs from the top business schools, but are, nevertheless, plagued by short-termism. Analysts routinely rue the tyranny of quarter results over decisions taken by corporate leaders. Let’s take the proposition further. If, indeed, technocrats are more capable of taking long-term decisions, why leave fiscal policy in the hands of elected representatives? How about a Fiscal Policy Committee that will implement the FRBM Act with more grit than politicians have shown? The reason that fiscal policy has not been delegated to technocrats is that it has multiple welfare and distributional effects that are best-weighed by elected representatives. Monetary policy, with its focus on inflation, is believed to be less complex in its impact and hence relatively easier to delegate to technocrats. However, this contention is increasingly coming to be questioned. Monetary policy too can have important distributional consequences and hence vesting it in technocrats can be moot. Low interest rates, such as those that followed the financial crisis of 2007, advantage borrowers over savers; they advantage owners of assets over those who don’t own any. Again, the impact of monetary policy on exchange rates and financial stability again has wider implications that cannot be left entirely to technocrats. Central bank independence has thus far been thought of overwhelmingly in relation to monetary policy. As we have shown above, in today’s context, even this is not as straightforward as it was in the late 1970s when steps to entrust it to technocrats were taken. When the United States decided to rewrite regulations for banks, it did not leave the matter to regulators. It was the U.S. Congress that passed the Dodd-Frank Act that defined the framework for regulation. Paul Tucker, a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, addresses the issue of elected representatives versus technocrats in a recent, much-acclaimed book aptly titled,  . Neither politicians nor technocrats are infallible. There is a crucial difference, though. When people find that they have suffered on account of decisions taken by technocrats, there can be an explosion of anger. Following the financial crisis, that’s precisely what we have seen in the U.S. and in Western Europe, with the many political consequences that have ensued. Any delegation of authority by elected representatives to technocrats must, therefore, rest on sound principles. Only then will authority exercised by technocrats enjoy legitimacy. Tucker outlines these principles – he calls them the  . Three of these are worth underlining. These principles are clearly reflected in the mandate for India’s Monetary Policy Committee. There is an objective, namely, the inflation rate, for which a band is specified. The policy instrument is the interest rate. Accountability is ensured by the RBI having to explain to Parliament any deviation from the inflation band. Turn now to some of the issues that Deputy Governor Viral Acharya flagged in his speech last week: regulation of public sector banks, a separate regulator for payments and the transfer of the RBI’s balance sheet surplus to the central government. To take up the first issue, applying the principles proposed by Tucker, the RBI can be given a free hand in the matter provided we can define the outcomes by which the RBI will be judged. This is not an easy task. Perhaps, over time, we will be able to define some outcomes. Until we do so, regulation must necessarily involve a role for the government. The creation of a separate regulator for payments is a discussion about the scope of functions of the RBI. It is similar to the proposal made earlier to hive-off the public debt management function from the RBI. A discussion on ‘scope’ cannot be said to be a discussion about ‘autonomy’ at all. The question of the transfer of surplus is a discussion about the appropriate level of reserves the RBI should have. Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, a friend and co-author of former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, had argued that the level of reserves at the RBI was above the level at several other central banks. For the government to raise the issue cannot be construed as threatening the autonomy of the RBI. The issues that Acharya has raised can and should be resolved through discussion with the government. The RBI should not try to become what Tucker calls an “overmighty citizen”. That will not serve the cause of the RBI or the nation. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Somasekhar Sundaresan,"A vital decision recently taken by the Supreme Court has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term health of our republic. The Supreme Court ruled that a writ petition seeking the establishment of a formal committee-based process for selection and appointment of the chief election commissioner and the election commissioners would be heard by a constitution bench comprising five Supreme Court judges. The Election Commission is the umpire conducting the fundamental, primary and the most vital feature of our republic, and thereby the bedrock of democracy – elections, where the will of the people is expressed. Selection to various vital positions — for example, that of the chief vigilance commissioner — involves a substantive, participative and inclusive selection process. The Supreme Court is reported to have observed that the issue has not been debated and answered before, and in exercise of powers under Article 145 (3) of the Constitution, since the issue involves a substantial question of law and interpretation of constitutional schemes, the question has been referred to a Constitution Bench for an authoritative pronouncement. The earlier Union government, UPA-II, was plagued by public outrage over its opposition to the institutional structure of selecting the   – which caught the imagination of the common man thanks to a campaign over the issue by Anna Hazare. Yet, on the issue of institutionalising the selection and appointment of election commissioners, the views of the Union of India has been stridently negative. The attorney general’s arguments against a collegial selection and appointment process involved naming some stalwarts who have been chief election commissioners. The argument by the attorney general that there have been no allegations of abuse of power is incorrect. In fact, when the attorney general listed names to show the kind of stalwarts who have been selected by the governments, the list was significant for election commissioners he did not name rather than those he named. Election commissioners named as spectacular successes were TN Seshan, JM Lyngdoh, N Gopalaswamy and SL Shakdar. But those he did not name included Navin Chawla and AK Joti, whose roles as Chief Election Commissioner involved some serious controversy. In fact, the Chief Election Commissioner N Gopalaswamy (one of those lauded as a great example of a CEC chosen by a government in power) had issued a  , seeking his removal for evident bias in favour of the Congress Party. That incumbent went on to be promoted as the chief election commissioner. Likewise, the six-month tenure of AK Joti, who had been principal secretary to the prime minister when he was the Gujarat chief minister,   – ranging from eyebrows being raised for using a government bungalow in Gujarat while his role was in Delhi (his answer was that he paid rent) to disqualifying 20 MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party without even granting them a personal hearing. Like a judge, an election commissioner must not only be fair and just but must be seen to be fair and just. If the Election Commission cannot command trust, the very faith in democracy would stand undermined and lead to anarchy. A selection committee for appointment could involve the prime minister, the leader of opposition and the speaker (presiding officer of the Lok Sabha) – three vital offices that would represent the full spectrum of the polity. It would be tempting to add to the mix, the chief justice of India and the vice president (who presides over the Rajya Sabha). However, the vice-president would be an added voice of the government of the day, and therefore would not bring in diversity of thought into the process. Likewise, the judiciary could perhaps best be kept out of the process for selecting an umpire who presides over the clash of politicians vying to head the executive arm of the State. There can be no “perfect” process, but any process involving greater inclusion, representativeness and diversity would be superior to the government of the day making the selection.

The News Minute,"The Kerala High Court on Monday observed that Sabarimala is for all while hearing a plea by BJP ‘Intellectual Cell’ state convener TG Mohandas, who sought a ban on the entry of non-Hindus from entering Sabarimala shrine. In his petition filed on 25 October , Mohandas sought a court declaration which would state that permitting the entry of non-Hindu women and non-idol worshippers into Sannidhanam violated Rule 3 of the Kerala Places of Places of Public Worship (Authorization of Entry) Act, 1965, given that the Supreme Court’s ruling only allowed the entry of Hindu women into the shrine.

Manasa Rao Megha Kaveri,"A friend of actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth, on Saturday 27 October, conveyed to DMK President MK Stalin Rajinikanth's disappointment about a satirical article on DMK mouthpiece Murasoli. Rajinikanth conveyed to the DMK leader that he was disturbed that the Dravidian party’s mouthpiece had decided to target him without reason. Though sources in the Stalin camp said that Rajinikanth had spoken directly to Stalin, a source from Rajinikanth camp said that it was a mutual friend who had spoken to Stalin. The source said that though Stalin does take decisions on Murasoli editorial, he had been travelling on that day, and a senior editorial resource had taken the call to publish the article. The Murasoli, on Sunday, 29 October, published a boxed ‘Instruction to the editorial team’. The instructions from Murasoli editor S Selvam said that it has been noticed that the article about Rajinikanth had hurt a ‘few good hearts’. A source close to Rajinikanth told TNM that the actor had been unhappy at the aggressive stand taken by Murasoli, even though Rajinikanth himself had never targeted the DMK or Karunanidhi's family incessantly. "","" the source said. The fodder for Murasoli’s satire, was a statement by Rajinikanth on 23 October, in which he categorically stated that he would not encourage people who join his political party with an aim to get party posts or earn money. The satirical article is an imagined conversation between the actor and a simpleton fan of his, in light of the actor's recent statement that had ruffled feathers within the party. “Spending 30-40 years in my fans club will not make one qualified to get a party post in Makkal Mandram or to enter politics,” Rajinikanth’s statement had said. This particular line was responded to in the Murasoli article, which asked, ""If working as a fan club member for 30-40 years is not an eligibility for entering politics, how is being an actor for the last 40 years an eligibility criteria?"" Quoting an oft-repeated statement of the actor during his political speeches telling his fans to take care of their families first before indulging in party activities which was also a part of the statement issued on 23 October, the 'fan' criticised Rajinikanth for not practising what he preaches. ""Why don't you take care of your family instead of entering politics?"" the imaginary fan asked. Following the publication of the Murasoli article, supporters of the actor and the DMK indulged in a bitter online fight over the political future of their respective leaders, Rajinikanth and MK Stalin. There have also been rumours that Murasoli had sacked a few people. However, speaking to TNM, sources in the Murasoli said that contrary to reports, the party mouthpiece had not sacked editors for the publication of the article. ""We have expressed regret for the article. These editors have been around for well over 30 years. Why would we sack them for this?"" said one member of the publication. Even as the two political stalwarts in the state – former Chief Ministers J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi – were constrained by illness and subsequently died, many actors from Kollywood saw a vacuum in the political landscape and launched their parties and outfits with Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan being the most prominent ones among them. Established political parties like the DMK and the AIADMK have criticised the star power which the duo have used for drumming up support.

It also had to register same changes with the Registrar of Societies in J&K and hold the elections for Working Committee and General Council ahead of the election of new apex office-bearers within two months. “That’s exactly what we have done,” JKCA’s interim Chief Executive Officer Syed Ashiq Hussain Bukhari told  . “We have gone strictly as per the Lodha Committee recommendations followed by directions of the Supreme Court and J&K High Court. As directed, we have drafted an exhaustive constitution and got the changes registered with the Registrar of Societies in J&K Government”. “We have done it to break the decades-long monopoly of certain vested interests. Previously, there were only two groups — one each from Srinagar and Jammu. Each controlled 16 clubs. So only ruling politicians like Farooq Abdullah and Imran Ansari would by default become JKCA’s presidents. We have done away with that system and proposed to give representations to District Associations, three votes to each of 22 districts”, Bukhari said. Justice RM Lodha, retired Chief Justice of Supreme Court, was appointed in January 2015 as head of a three-member committee to suggest administrative reforms in the BCCI when charges of corruption, match-fixing and betting stirred the game of cricket in India. On 18 July 2016, bench of Justice DY Chandrachud endorsed many of the Lodha Committee recommendations. It included disqualification of the apex office-bearers or members in case they held a public office (politicians and government officials) or those having reached age of 70 years. On 9 August 2018, a three-member bench comprising then-CJI Dipak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud ordered that an interim COA should draft BCCI’s constitution in light of the Lodha Committee’s endorsed recommendations within one month and get the same registered with the Registrar of Societies, Chennai. It ordered that subsequently the BCCI’s State associations should draft their constitutions on similar lines and get the same registered with respective registrars of societies with submission of a certificate of compliance to the CEO at BCCI. On 13 October 2017, Justice Aloke Aradhe of J&K High Court directed appointment of retired judge of Supreme Court of India, CK Prasad, and retired Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, Rifat Alam, as members of the COA for JKCA. Subsequently, on 6 December 2017, Division Bench of Mohammad Yaqoob Mir and Ali Mohammad Magrey further ordered appointment of retired Deputy Inspector General of Police, SAH Bukhari, as interim CEO. It also ordered retired judge Mohammad Basheerudin’s appointment as Ombudsman to resolve internal disputes of some clubs affiliated to JKCA. Elections to JKCA’s Working Committee, which draws 64 members from 32 affiliate clubs and elects the apex office-bearers, as also to the 160-member General Council, which gets five members from each club, had become necessary after endorsement of the Lodha Committee recommendations by the Supreme Court. Five of the eight apex office-bearers, including President Imran Ansari (then Minister of Sports) had to quit for one or the other disqualification. One of the prominent complainants, former General Secretary of JKCA Iqbal Ahmad Shah, has claimed in his representations that the interim COA has “attempted to impose a fresh monopoly” over JKCA under the smokescreen of Supreme Court of India and the J&K High Court orders and Lodha Committee recommendations. “They have enacted a fraud. Neither Lodha nor any court has terminated BCCI’s constituent associations. BCCI’s COA has lawfully introduced only some administrative changes. It has not made any structural change. It’s fine that all politicians and government officials, those having attained 70 years of age and those having served for three tenures of three years each (total nine years) have been made ineligible. This is what JKCA’s COA should have done”, Shah asserted. “Contrarily, they have tampered with JKCA’s fundamental structure. (JKCA’s) Constitution makes it clear that the structural changes can come only through a resolution passed at an extraordinary meeting at the General Council by a majority of three-fourths of the members. Courts or COA can’t interfere with it”, Shah added. According to Iqbal Shah and other complainants, some clubs and former office-bearers had filed caveats with the Registrar of Societies, requesting him not to accept amendments to the fundamental structure. “In the newly drafted constitution, the interim COA has proposed Governor as Patron of JKCA without knowledge and approval of Raj Bhavan. How can Governor be proposed as Patron of a private society? On these lines, BCCI should have made President of India as its Patron. Have they done it?”, Shah added. He complained that Registrar of Societies refused to hear the complainants and registered the “illegal amendments” fraudulently. “The CEO is a well-mannered retired Police officer but unfortunately a number of serving and retired Police officials are now calling the shots in JKCA. They include selectors and secretaries to officers. Some of them are very much influential and they seem to enjoy support from a section of judges and lawyers. We still have high hopes in judiciary. We hope someone will come to the rescue of cricket from judiciary”, said the president of a club affiliated to the JKCA for over 30 years. “J&K High Court had appointed CEO and members of the COA specifically for two months. They have never sought an extension to their tenure. High Court hasn’t granted it either. How can they operate eight months after expiry of their term and get this new constitution registered. This all is in total contravention to the Supreme Court and High Court orders as also to the good job done by BCCI’s COA,” he asserted. Top criminal lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, Rizwan Merchant told   that it was indeed questionable that the CEO upon his appointment further proceeded to appoint none other than the nephew of one of the judges of Division Bench that appointed him earlier. “They are also well aware that another standing counsel of JKCA has his wife as the Law Officer with Registrar of Societies. This raises serious doubts about the fairness in their working and rather reflects  . JKCA can’t be fiefdom of one or two particular families. How can the husband help in drafting JKCA’s constitution and the same lawyer’s wife get it registered with Registrar of Societies?” Merchant said. “The scandalous intentions are also evident from the fact that the interim CEO and COA have introduced the provision of Donor Members, opening up a Pandora’s box to conduct financial investigations into the working of JKCA. Now anybody of 21 years of age, who is ready to pay Rs 10 lakh, is entitled to become member of JKCA. This will clearly lead to corruption and allow criminal elements to seep in the association. Anybody paying 10 lakhs will expect returns. This is unprecedented in BCCI and other states’ cricket associations. I hope Governor and High Court will notice it and terminate this new registration”, advocate Merchant asserted. CEO Bukhari said, “We have done it all as per court directions. These people (complainants) have challenged it in High Court. If the High Court finds anything amiss, we will make amendments as per its directions”.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Theja Ram,"It was a perceived win for the BJP in the upcoming bypolls in the Shivamogga Lok Sabha constituency. The seat, which has been a fortress of the BJP since 2009, does not seem impenetrable anymore. BY Raghavendra, son of former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, was announced as the BJP’s prized candidate well ahead of the elections. The Congress was to field its candidates for the Shivamogga, Ballari and Jamkhandhi bypolls, JD(S) was to field its leaders in Mandya and Ramanagara. With no Congress leader showing interest to contest the Shivamogga seat, the BJP was doubly sure of a win and was mulling about fielding Raghavendra for the 2019 General elections as well. But things took a turn when the Congress decided to give up Shivamogga and the JD(S) zeroed in on Madhu Bangarappa as its candidate. “Several names of Congress leaders were doing the rounds but none of them wanted to contest or spend money just to be elected for one year. That’s why the Congress decided to give up that seat,” a Congress source said. The Congress-JD(S) alliance, for once, brought the cadre from both parties together and with a sense of rejuvenated enthusiasm, party workers and leaders began campaigning for Bangarappa. The Shivamogga district is dominated by members of the Lingayat community followed by the Edigas, Dalits, Brahmins, Muslims, Vokkaligas and OBCs. Besides, there is also a sizable population of the Jains, Rajputs, Christians and also Tamil-speaking people. Lingayats have always voted for the BJP in Shivamogga, and Yeddyurappa and his son Raghavendra, being Lingayats, have had the upper hand, until Bangarappa’s nomination was announced. The Lingayats, Brahmins, Edigas, Bants, Jains and a section of the Dalits have voted for the BJP since former Chief Minister S Bangarappa’s demise in 2011. S Bangarappa’s son Madhu, an Ediga, can win the Ediga and Dalit votes in the region. With the break in the caste combination, chances of Raghavendra’s win is dicey, sources say. In the 2018 Assembly elections, the Ediga votes had shifted to the BJP as Madhu Bangarappa’s brother Kumar Bangarappa had contested on a BJP ticket. “Since S Bangarappa, no leader from the Ediga community has been elected to the Lok Sabha. This may sway them towards Madhu,” the source said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Sandeep Sahu,"Five years ago, the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha won high praise in the form of a citation by the UN Secretary General for Disaster Preparedness, for keeping human casualties caused by Cyclone Phailin to a minimum (21). Since then ‘zero casualty’ became the Odisha government’s claim to fame. As before, including during Cyclone Hudhud in 2014, ‘zero casualty’ figured prominently in preparatory meetings and media briefings this time too. Even two days after the cyclone struck, the government kept claiming that ‘no one’ had died in the cyclone. A fortnight down the line however, it has been compelled to admit 74 deaths, a majority of them in the worst-hit Gajapati district, with the possibility of the numbers increasing not ruled out. Clearly, the government has got it all wrong this time. The fact that the government was ‘in the dark’ about such a large number of deaths even 48 hours after the disaster struck is shocking. As if that wasn’t bad enough, its claim that 3.6 lakh people had been evacuated from the coast  of Titli was proven false later, not by any outsider, but by themselves. While the aggregated figure of the number of people evacuated released by the office of the Special Relief Commissioner was 3.6 lakh, the district-wise break up added up to no more than 1.13 lakh. More embarrassment was waiting for the state government in the days after the cyclone. Villagers of Baraghar, a remote, hilly village in Gajapati district that lost as many as 18 people – claimed that they had no information about the cyclone before it struck. When their roofs were blown away by the strong wind, they had rushed to a cave in the nearby hill for shelter. To their misfortune, the cave caved in under the impact of the heavy rains triggered by the cyclone. Many of them were crushed under the debris while others were swept away by the slush. Special Relief Commissioner Dr Bishnupada Sethi made a feeble attempt to contradict the villagers, claiming that government officials had reached the village ahead of the cyclone and ‘advised’ them to move to a safer place. While 68 families moved out, seven did not. And all the deceased belonged to these seven families, he pointed out. Even assuming that the SRC’s claims are true, the contrast between the government’s handling of Cyclone Phailin in 2013 and its handling (or lack thereof) of Titli, could not be more stark. In 2013, in evacuating over nine lakh people living along the southern coast, the government did not allow anyone – not even the fishermen families which refused to budge – the option of staying put. In fact, the police had to be pressed into action at many places to mobilize people. However this time, no one in the government, including the SRC, has so far explained why the same was not done during Titli. The truth is while the government was busy focusing on the long coast, it had not bargained for the heavy rains that lashed the hilly interiors of Ganjam, Gajapati and Rayagada districts. Since many of the places that received the maximum rains are remote, inaccessible areas without electricity, they were caught completely off-guard and had nowhere to go when disaster struck. Reliable sources in the government say Collectors of the southern districts led the mandarins in the State Secretariat up the garden path and convinced them that the situation was well under control during a review meeting through video conference around noon, on the day the cyclone struck early in the morning. The government’s claim of ‘zero casualty’ was based on the word of the Collectors, who clearly failed to rise to the occasion this time, unlike in 2013. This being said, it will be unfair to ignore all the good work the government has done with regard to disaster-preparedness and management, since the Super Cyclone on 29 October 1999. The worst-ever natural disaster in the state’s history, which had wiped out close to 10, 000 lives and devastated as many as 14 of the state’s 30 districts, had also swept away the Congress government, bringing in the BJD-BJP alliance into power in the state. The new government headed by Naveen Patnaik went about the mammoth task of reconstruction in right earnest, initiating a host of measures to limit the number of casualties in the future. One of the first such measures was the formation of the Odisha State Disaster Mitigation (now Management) Authority (OSDMA), the first dedicated agency to combat disasters anywhere in the country. This was followed by the raising of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF), a dedicated force with the required skills and equipment to undertake rescue and reconstruction measures during, and after disasters. The agency received high praise for its work during the recent floods in Kerala. In place of the handful of cyclone shelters that existed before the Super Cyclone, Odisha now boasts of as many as 836 of them, all along its 480-km long coast. If not No. 1, Odisha is certainly among the best-prepared states for such disasters. The measures to face Titli were in place, but what was missing this time was the seriousness on the part of the government. Complacency led to failure in gauging the possible impact of the cyclone and the places it would hit, leading to avoidable human casualties. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Srishti Tyagi,"In one of his sharpest attacks yet on Narendra Modi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said his successor's rule has not been good for India. Singh said Modi has ""failed"" the electorate and led a government that was ""mostly silent"" on incidents of communal violence, mob lynching and cow vigilantism. Singh, while speaking at the launch of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's new book, alleged that under the present dispensation, the environment in universities and national institutions like the CBI was being “vitiated and stifled”. His remarks came amid the current crisis in the CBI, which saw its top two bosses be divested of their powers and sent on leave by the government. In a scathing criticism of Modi, Singh said, in the past four years, he and his government ""failed"" their electorate and eroded the voters' faith. Singh said Modi is a ""paradoxical prime minister"" and Tharoor has demonstrated this through his ""superbly written and devastatingly accurate book"". Tharoor's book is titled ""The Paradoxical Prime Minister: Narendra Modi and His India"". Singh, in his speech, also came down hard on the government's economic policies, saying nothing concrete had been done to bring back the ""promised billions of dollars"" allegedly held abroad as black money. The ""hastily-implemented"" demonetisation and GST have proved to be ""disastrous"" for the economy, the former prime minister said. Petrol and diesel prices are at a ""historic high"" despite the fall in international crude oil prices because the Modi government chose to levy excessive excise duties instead of passing the benefits of low prices to the people of India, he said, adding that Modi, instead, has thought it fit to ""punish our people"".

Mayank Mishra,"National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who carries more weight than the exalted position he holds, forcefully argues that the country needs a strong government – an euphemism for single-party rule at the Centre, for at least 10 years. He would like us to believe that big, bold decisions can be taken by an overtly powerful regime alone. That weak regimes are prone to succumb to the temptations of vote-catching populist measures. While delivering a rare public lecture recently, he warned us against the dangers of enemies within. Implicit in his assertion was the belief that only a macho regime can rid the country of enemies within and outside. Since the statement came from a sharp mind, wielding enormous clout in the present dispensation, I grudgingly persuaded myself to believe it. Russian President Vladimir Putin perhaps presides over the strongest government one can possibly conceive of.   is what I found out about the new czar of Russia who has ruled the country with an iron hand for 18 years and is still going very, very strong: “Over the past 10 years, Russia’s economic growth was negligible, recording average annual growth of 0.9 percent and a devaluation of the national currency by more than 50 percent. In terms of economic size, Russia moved from being the sixth to the 12th largest economy in the world, having lost more than a quarter of its GDP in dollar terms. Western sanctions contributed to a poor investment climate and technological isolation, thus dampening growth prospects. After private consumption declined four years in a row, inequality in Russia has increased significantly, and public discontent and dissatisfaction continue to grow.” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is up there in the league of very strong leaders. Having already ruled the country for 15 years, Erdogan has got yet another term.  is an account of the first few weeks of his brand-new term: “Hours before taking the oath of office – after 15 years already in power – Mr Erdogan published a 143-page decree changing the way almost every government department and public body in the country operates. In the days since, he has issued several equally lengthy decrees and presidential decisions, centralising power and giving him the ability to exert control in nearly all areas of life with almost unchecked authority.” The Lira has depreciated nearly 33 percent this year alone, the inflation rules at 25 percent and the country’s economy is on the verge of collapsing, triggering a full blown global financial crisis. One can get a sense of the crisis by looking at the   that “in September, the MPC (monetary policy committee) raised the benchmark by 625 basis points, bringing the total amount of tightening this year to over 11 percentage points.” Raising interest rates by 6.25 percent in one month and 11 percent in 9 months! These are abnormal measures taken in the face of unprecedented crisis. Turkey is clearly facing a huge economic crisis and this has happened despite 15 years of very strong government. We can always argue that ours is a unique country and cannot be compared to Russia or Turkey. Now let us look at the track record of strong and so-called weak governments back home in the last fifty years. Here is a list of 10 bold and far-reaching decisions taken by various governments in the last five decades: While the country took years to get over the blow of emergency, we will have to wait for a few more years to fully comprehend the damages caused by demonetisation. It is not very difficult to understand why the so-called weak governments have surprised us on the upside.   is my quick take on why they have worked when most expected them to fail. Suffice here to say that we need a consensus builder, a patient listener and a leader inclined to share power and responsibility to make the governance accessible in our country. Looking at the track record of strong leaders in our country and abroad, can we still convince ourselves in believing that we need a strong government for at least 10 years? Mr Doval, also underscored the need to have our own Alibabas to take a giant leap forward. I would request him and all the policymakers to have a look at the   on why it does not happen in India.

Indira Basu,"India, in its 71 years of independence, has seen some ‘accidental’ prime ministers. But perhaps it is for the first time, that we are watching a ‘paradoxical’ leader at the helm. On Friday, 26 October, Dr Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament and author, officially launched his latest tome,  at Delhi’s Nehru Memorial Museum & Library. Inaugurated by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, the panel, moderated by senior journalist Bhupendra Chaubey, comprised Arun Shourie, former bureaucrat Pavan K Varma, former AAP spokesman Ashutosh, and Congress party leader P Chidambaram. In his inaugural speech, Dr Singh, usually a man of few words, made some hard-hitting statements. “In 2014, Shri Narendra Modi ji was elected as prime minister on the back of many lofty promises... but the ruling government has mostly been silent in the face of widespread communal violence, mob lynching... at the same time, academic freedom is being sought to be curbed, and independent institutions like the CBI are being vitiated and stifled. On the economic front, nothing concrete has been done... a hastily implement demonetisation and GST have proved to be disastrous,” said the former prime minister. “Petrol and diesel prices are at a historic high, despite a fall in international crude oil prices, because the Modi government chose to levy excessive excise duties. Instead of passing on the benefits of low prices to the people of India, Shri Modi thought it fit to punish our people,” Dr Singh continued. He went on to add, “A fearful population, and an economy that has been set back by foolhardy initiatives, a painful lack of jobs, growing distress among India’s farming community, a devastating number of farmer suicides, insecure borders, instability in Kashmir, and the palpable failure of even laudable initiatives like ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’. This is the India, Prime Minister Modi presides over - not a secular, plural, free and equal society, that our founding fathers had envisioned... Shri Modi’s rule has not been good for India, and it all arises from the “Modi paradox” that Shashi shows us in his book.” Modi’s rule has turned out be nothing short of a series of marketing gimmicks, with very little substance having been achieved on the ground. Shashi Tharoor, after reading out a few excerpts from his book, went on to talk about the “Modi brand”, which has been meticulously curated and built since 2014. “There is an image doing the rounds since 2014, that Modi is a selfless figure... he has no family, therefore, why should he be corrupt? But then again Dr Manmohan Singh was also a selfless person... however, we (the Congress) aren’t in the business of marketing,” said Tharoor. Speaking on Modi’s cherished Gujarat model of development, Tharoor went on to say, “There are some good things about Gujarat for sure. Running water, 24x7 electricity, but not everything in Gujarat is perfect... it is a showy version of development, but no real stuff. Literacy rate is low.” As the discussion was getting heated up, Ashutosh commented, deviating from what the others were saying, “We are looking at Modi the man, not the ideology... we need to understand his ideology and impact. We don’t ever try to understand the ideology that created Modi... it is the same ideology which led to 1992 Babri Masjid row and riots, the 2002 Gujarat riots,...Modi has been propped up by this same ideology.” Shaking up the political echo chamber a wee bit, Pavan Varma said, he had resonated with primarily the first chapter of Tharoor’s book, but not quite with the rest of it. He went on to say, “Why is the Opposition in so much disarray? Why can’t they put up somebody who can look Modi in the eye?” To this, Arun Shourie retorted in Hindi, that we may not have seen “acche din” yet, but “BJP ke zaroor bure din aa gaye hai.”  And yet, the Modi narrative runs strong. Shourie attributes this to the “power of falsehood.” As the doors to 2019 stand wide open, let the battle (and theatrics) begin. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

A veteran of the BJP, Khurana was the chief minister of Delhi from 1993 to 1996 and was appointed the governor of Rajasthan in 2004. Harish Khurana said that his father had been suffering from a chest infection and fever since the last few days and was feeling breathless since Saturday morning. He had suffered a brain haemorrhage about five years ago and had been ailing since then. His last rites will be held on Sunday, his family said. Union Minister Harsh Vardhan offered condolences in a tweet: Apart from his stints as Delhi CM and Rajasthan governor, Khurana was at the height of his political career when he served as the Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. He is also credited with reviving the party in the capital after BJP’s bad loss in the general elections of 1984, held after Indira Gandhi’s death. Not one to mince words, Khurana had also been at the receiving end of the BJP’s ire as he was expelled from the party on at least one occasion for criticising party leaders. In 2005, he was allegedly removed the from the BJP for “indiscipline” after criticising BJP veteran LK Advani. He was reportedly taken back after he issued an apology. The following year, he was expelled from the primary membership of the BJP for announcing that he would be attending expelled leader Uma Bharti’s rally in the capital. In 1991, along with LK Advani, VC Shukla, P Shiv Shankar, Sharad Yadav and Balram Jakhar, Khurana was named as an accused in a case of large scale payments made to hawala brokers. The raid was a result of the arrest of militants in Kashmir, but the case eventually collapsed without a single conviction. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The News Minute,"A delegation from the central government led by Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sanjeev Kumar Jindal visited Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday, 25 October, to take stock of the damage caused by Cyclone Titli in the state's Uddanam region. The team members interacted with victims and were guided by District Collector K Dhananjaya Reddy. They said that they would prepare a detailed report on the damage and the compensation that was needed to be disbursed to the victims, and submit it to the Centre for further action. According to  , many locals expressed their helplessness to the delegation as they had lost years of hard work, with coconut and cashew trees being uprooted, and said that their future was uncertain as it would take several years to plant and grow the trees again. After meeting locals, the delegation also spoke to several district officials on the steps taken by the state government so far. Earlier this week, the Andhra Pradesh government made a representation to the central government and demanded that Cyclone Titli be declared a national calamity, adding that the state required Rs 1,200 crore immediately as interim relief.

PTI,"In one of his sharpest attacks yet on Narendra Modi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said his successor's rule has not been good for India as he had ""failed"" the electorate and led a government that was ""mostly silent"" on incidents of communal violence, mob lynching and cow vigilantism. Singh, while speaking at the launch of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's new book, alleged that under the present dispensation, the environment in universities and national institutions like the CBI, was being vitiated and dissent stifled. His remarks came amid the current crisis in the CBI, whose top two bosses were divested of their powers and sent on leave by the government. He said Modi is a ""paradoxical Prime Minister"" and Tharoor has demonstrated this through his ""superbly written and devastatingly accurate book"". Tharoor's book is titled ""The Paradoxical Prime Minister: Narendra Modi and His India"". ""He (Modi) has spoken of being a prime minister for all Indians but the government he presides over has been mostly silent in the face of widespread communal violence, mob lynching and cow vigilantism. At the same time, academic freedoms are being sought to be curbed. The environment in our universities and national institutions like the CBI is being vitiated and dissent stifled,"" Singh alleged. Singh, in his speech, also came down hard on the government's economic policies, saying nothing concrete had been done to bring back the ""promised billions of dollars"" allegedly held abroad as black money. The ""hastily-implemented"" demonetisation and GST have proved to be ""disastrous"" for the economy, the former Prime Minister said. Petrol and diesel prices are at a ""historic high"" despite the fall in international crude oil prices because the Modi government chose to levy excessive excise duties instead of passing the benefits of low prices to the people of India, he said, adding that Modi, instead, has thought it fit to ""punish our people"". Singh also alleged that Modi presides over a ""fearful population, an economy that has been set back by foolhardy initiatives, painful lack of jobs, the growing distress among India's farming communities, a devastating number of farmer suicides, insecure borders, instability in Kashmir, and the palpable failure in implementation of even laudable initiatives like Swachh Bharat, Skill Development, Make in India and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao"". Modi's rule has ""not been good"" for India and it all arises from the Modi paradox that Tharoor has shown in his book, he said. Singh lauded Tharoor for coming out with the ""timely book, reminding us that the idea of India is under threat today from those who seek not just to rule India, but to change India's very heart and soul"".

Theja Ram,"The air was tense with anticipation at the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce in Bengaluru on Thursday evening. The members of the Film Chamber were walking in and out of the conference room, waiting for the “elders” in Sandalwood to address the giant elephant in the room. President of the Karnataka Artists Association and veteran Sandalwood actor Ambareesh was called in to “broker peace” between actors Sruthi Hariharan and Arjun Sarja. The meeting was held after Arjun’s father-in-law, Rajesh filed a complaint with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, alleging that Sruthi Hariharan’s allegations of sexual harassment against Arjun were false. The meeting began at around 5 pm. Ambareesh held talks with Sruthi and Arjun individually after several members of the KFCC debated about the issue. Also present at the meeting was director Kavita Lankesh, actor Pooja Gandhi, President of KFCC Chinne Gowda, producer Rockline Venkatesh and Congress MLA and producer Munirathna. Soon after the meeting, Ambareesh announced that the meeting was held in order to arrive at a compromise between Sruthi and Arjun. “We have listened to them. A decision will be taken soon. Sruthi is saying she is the one who has been wronged and Arjun claims to be innocent. How are we to judge what is right and wrong?” Ambareesh said. Emerging out of the meeting, Arjun Sarja declared that he would come out “victorious in the battle” and this would be a “lesson to all those who plan to malign the reputation of actors”. “This will be a lesson. To all those who want to malign the name of innocent people. There is no question of a compromise. I will fight this to the end and come out victorious. The 'Me Too' movement is being maligned. If the actors wanted to talk about sexual harassment, they could have approached me and I would have gladly supported it. But this is no way of doing things,” Arjun said. Sruthi Hariharan too made it clear that she would never compromise with Arjun. The actor had opened up about the sexual harassment she faced at the hands of Arjun Sarja while filming the Kannada movie Vismaya and Tamil movie  last week. “I am the one who has been wronged. I respect KFCC and since they have asked me to hold off filing a complaint till Friday, I will respect that. I will announce my decision once the meeting is over. I wanted to file a complaint when I came out with my story but since the Film Chamber members told me to hold off for a while, I respected that,” Sruthi added. Arjun has filed two cases against Sruthi – a defamation case for RS 5 crore and a plea for a restraint order on her. The media waiting outside turned the whole episode into a “whose-side-are-you-on” game, while the issue of sexual harassment was sidelined. Thursday marked a new low for insensitive coverage of cases of sexual harassment. A large section of the Kannada media covering the sexual harassment case bombarded Sruthi Hariharan with these questions. This was in stark contrast to how Arjun Sarja was treated by the same mediapersons. Sarja was asked questions about how he was coping and whether his family members were holding up well “Sir, how is your family coping with this? Are you going to forgive her and arrive at a compromise?” While it was a small consolation to see a few women journalists roll their eyes at the insensitivity, the media has already set the tone for the Film Chamber's 'inquiry'. The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, which still does not have an Internal Complaints Committee, decided to bring Sruthi Hariharan in direct contact with Arjun Sarja. It also became evident that the KFCC was unaware that it was mandatory for the chamber to set up an ICC. “Why should we set up an ICC? You guys do it. Why should we do it? Let the women do it,” said actor Ambareesh. When asked whether the Film Chamber would support such an ICC, if at all it was formed, Ambareesh dismissed it with a sexist joke. “Why should we support it? We are a small industry and we have sorted out thing by ourselves. Why should we set it up?” Ambareesh added. Ambareesh was then informed by the media that the setting up of the ICC was mandatory as per the Sexual Harassment Act 2013, to which the actor laughed, shrugged and said, “I have to study about Me Too. Please send print outs of lessons to me, I will read it. I don’t know what all this is. We will see about setting up the ICC.” In what came as no surprise, Arjun Sarja’s media manager Prashanth Sampargi politicised the issue and called the Me Too movement anti-Hindu. “The Me Too movement in India is an anti-Hindu campaign designed to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a run up to the 2019 election,” he said. Sampargi made more bizarre allegations and claimed that Arjun was being targeted as he was planning to construct a Hanuman temple worth Rs 25 crore and Sruthi had connections to communists in Kerala. ""The Christian missionaries in the US are trying to hurt Hindu sentiments and malign Arjun Sarja’s name,” Sampargi said.

Manasa Rao,"Over a month after Sofia Lois, a Canada-based research scholar from Tamil Nadu, was detained for sloganeering at BJP Tamil Nadu President Tamilisai Soundararajan, a local court in Thoothukudi has ordered an FIR be registered against the political leader. On Thursday, Thoothukudi Judicial Magistrate III S Tamilselvi gave directions to police to file an FIR and carry out an investigation against Tamilisai for allegedly abusing, harassing and threatening Sofia Luis. The directive comes on the back of a petition filed by Sofia’s father Professor AA Samy. This after the police took no action on a complaint filed by him against Tamilisai and BJP cadre. It was then that Samy moved court seeking to register a case against Tamilisai and BJP cadre. In its order, the court said, “The petitioner counsel filed the CD and it reveals that there is certain threatening by the party members. The petitioner counsel alleged that it happens due to the instigation of first respondent Tamilisai Soundararajan...This court felt that there is a sufficient ground to register the complaint against the persons who came along with first respondent Tamilisai Soundararajan.” The magistrate also added that CCTV footage from both the Thoothukudi airport as well as the Pudukottai police station has to be verified before an FIR is filed. The court called for a report to be filed on the matter before 20 November. Speaking to TNM, Athisiyakumar, Sofia Lois' lawyer said, ""We are doubtful if action will be taken. But we hope there is action on orders. We have requested action under Indian Penal Code Section 341(Punishment for wrongful restraint), 294(b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both), 506(1)(Punishment for criminal intimidation) and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.” On 3 September, on a flight from Chennai to Thoothukudi, Sofia Lois, who was travelling with her parents encountered Tamilisai Soundararajan. Just as Tamilisai passed by her seat, she shouted, “Down with the fascist BJP government.” A video from the Thoothukudi airport that went viral shortly after the incident showed Tamilisai losing her cool and confronting the student over her sloganeering along with her cadre. Sofia was arrested based on a complaint by Tamilisai and remanded to judicial custody overnight. Following the altercation, Sofia's father, Professor AA Samy, had also registered a police complaint against Tamilisai Soundararajan and the BJP cadre who were present at the Thoothukudi airport. In his complaint, AA Samy said that Tamilisai did not say anything inside the flight and that the issue began after they reached the baggage area of the airport. Speaking to TNM, Samy said, “Tamilisai walked out, called all the BJP supporters waiting outside and gathered them. They began shouting at us and threatening us. They said, if you come out, we will hack you, we will kill you. They used some vulgar words as well.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Suzan Fraser Christopher Torchia,"Turkey on Friday, 26 October, intensified its demands for Saudi Arabia to extradite 18 suspects in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a call that is likely to be met with resistance from the kingdom and could escalate tensions between the US-allied regional powers. Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, meanwhile, gave an anguished and tearful TV interview in which she said she keeps asking herself if she had missed some signs and should have prevented him from entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on 2 October — questions that she says she cannot answer. The Istanbul chief prosecutor's office submitted a request for Saudi Arabia to hand over the suspects in the killing, and the Turkey's Foreign Ministry will formally notify the kingdom, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The Saudi government has said it arrested and would itself punish 18 people for what it described as a rogue operation by officials who killed Khashoggi in the consulate. Saudi Arabia has returned suspects to Turkey before. The stakes are much higher in the Khashoggi case, however, as some of those implicated are close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's heir apparent whose condemnation of the killing failed to ease suspicions that he was involved. Turkish prosecutors want the suspects to face prosecution for ""premeditated killing executed with fiendish sentiments or by causing torment,"" according to the Anadolu agency. Turkey's judicial system is better equipped to serve the cause of justice in this case, the official said, adding: ""The court proceedings in Turkey will be open to international observers in order to ensure the greatest level of transparency."" Turkey alleges a 15-member hit squad was sent to Istanbul to kill the journalist, a onetime Saudi insider who became a critic of Prince Mohammed and was a columnist for The Washington Post. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the three others in the group of 18 who were detained in Saudi Arabia were consulate employees. Erdogan said Friday that Turkey would reveal more evidence about the killing but was not in any rush to do so, indicating that Turkish authorities will methodically increase pressure on Saudi Arabia even as the kingdom floats conflicting statements in a vain and often clumsy attempt to end the crisis. ""There is no point in being too hasty,"" Erdogan said in an address to ruling party leaders. He added that the Saudis who killed Khashoggi must reveal the location of his body. Hours after Erdogan's speech, Khashoggi's fiancée Hatice Cengiz told HaberTurk, a Turkish news channel, about her pain since he disappeared after entering the consulate. ""I found myself in a darkness I cannot express,"" Cengiz said. She described how she had accompanied Khashoggi, 59, to the consulate and waited outside while, she thought, he was getting paperwork for their planned marriage. He never came out. Cengiz said she has not received any condolence call from Saudi officials after the death of Khashoggi, who left Saudi Arabia for self-imposed exile in the United States a year ago. On Thursday, one of the journalist's sons, Salah Khashoggi, flew with his family from Saudi Arabia to the US. Prince Mohammed has condemned the killing, but critics suspect a cover-up designed to protect him, noting that he has tight control over the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom. While Saudi Arabia has been the focus of widespread condemnation, Turkey has seen its fortunes rise as it showcases its investigative mettle with leaks of evidence to media outlets and an effort to steer international revulsion over the killing. It is something of a turnaround for Turkey, which was recently sparring with the US and other Western countries, even though differences among the allies remain. ""We have given and continue to give information and documents to anyone who is curious, although not the originals,"" Erdogan said of the Khashoggi file. ""We gave them to Saudi Arabia also. They all get shocked when they see the information and documents. The expressions they use are very interesting. Because the issue is not an ordinary issue."" Erdogan has shared information on the investigation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Turkish officials in the president's office said on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations. In a telephone call Friday, the two agreed on the need for ""all aspects of the murder"" to be exposed and for the killers to be brought to account, the officials said. CIA director Gina Haspel, who was in Turkey earlier this week to review evidence, briefed US President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday. Saudi Arabia's chief prosecutor will arrive in Turkey on Sunday as part of the investigation and will meet with Turkish counterparts, according to Erdogan. Support for the Saudi narrative of events in the case won support from Russia. President Vladimir Putin spoke to Saudi King Salman on Thursday, and Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters Friday that the Kremlin accepts the royal family's denial of any role in Khashoggi's killing. ""There is an official statement from the king and an official statement from the crown prince,"" Peskov said. ""No one has any reason to disbelieve that.""

Smitha TK,"Hearing exiled CBI chief Alok Verma's case against the government for stripping him of all powers and sending him on leave, the Supreme Court has ordered the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) inquiry against Verma under the supervision of former Supreme Court judge, AK Patnaik. The Bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi told the inquiry against him must be completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, M Nageshwar Rao, the man who has been made the interim CBI director, will serve as an administrator and cannot take any policy decisions. The Bench also directed that all decisions taken by M Nageshwar Rao from 23 October should be submitted in a sealed cover to the Supreme Court. Justice Ananga Kumar Patnaik was born in 1949 in Orissa. Throughout a good student, he was selected by the Rotary Foundation in Group Study Exchange Programme in 1976 and enrolled with the State Bar Council of Orissa in 1974. He has practised at the High Court, Subordinate Courts and Tribunals in Orissa and also the Supreme Court of India. He has been nominated by the Chief Justice of India as the the Chairman of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Law and Allied Subjects. He has been conferred with the degree of Doctor of Law (Honoris Causa) by the Utkal University. Justice AK Patnaik was appointed as a judge at the Supreme Court in November 2009 and he retired in June 2014. During his tenure as the chief justice of two states, he was known for his bold judgments, and was seen to be pro poor. Justice Patnaik was in the forefront making stinging attacks on the Collegium system for the appointment and transfer of judges. “Many competent persons have often been ignored and those who were close to members of the SC Collegium were chosen because there was no objective assessment whatsoever while making the selections,” a  assessment reported him saying. In 2011, Patnaik was a member of the ‘In-House Committee’ to probe into the allegations made against Justice Soumitra Sen while an impeachment motion was moved against him. The committee had concluded that Soumitra Sen was guilty of misconduct and called for his immediate removal. He resigned ahead of the impeachment motion against him in the Lok Sabha. Patnaik was a part of the bench which on 27 February 2012  to implement the ambitious interlinking of rivers project. They appointed a high-powered committee comprising representatives of various government departments, ministries, experts and social activists to plan and execute the project. In 2012, a special two-judge bench comprising Justices AK Patnaik and GS Singhvi was constituted by then Chief Justice of India SH Kapadia for hearing all cases arising out of the 2G spectrum scam. Patnaik was also part of the 2013 bench which struck down  Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act that allows convicted lawmakers a three-month period for filing appeal to the higher court and to get a stay of the conviction and sentence. He was part of a three-judge bench of justices in 2012 to probe into criminal cases against exporters who were inquired in the preliminary investigation and had exported iron ore of more than 50,000 tonnes without valid permits.

Smruti Koppikar,"Uddhav Thackeray, steering the course of the 52-year-old Shiv Sena and setting its compass for the next decade, is not a great fan of Shakespeare’s work. Yet, the classic dilemma from Hamlet – “To be, or not to be...” – best describes his political predicament of the last four years. And underscores his Dussehra speech at Mumbai’s famed Shivaji Park. Since the late 1980s, the Shiv Sena was in the driver’s seat of the anti-Congress forces, the hub around which right-of-centre parties in Maharashtra gravitated, never mind that the Congress had a subtle role in the Sena’s early growth. The BJP was a bit player, adding to Thackeray’s belligerence or providing him the cover of sophistication as required, content to be the younger brother to Sena’s “big brother”. This equation reflected in their seat allocations during elections, vote percentages, and the influence and visibility they enjoyed in the public domain. Neither Pramod Mahajan’s death in 2006 nor Bal Thackeray’s passing away six years later changed it. The BJP riding the pro-Modi wave challenged the Sena, did better at the hustings. Six months later, on the eve of Maharashtra Assembly election, it pulled the plug on the alliance, leaving Uddhav Thackeray and the Sena with a sense of great betrayal and electoral test. He led his party to a neck-and-neck situation with the buoyant BJP, enough to ensure that Modi-Shah could not form the state government without his party. Since then, Thackeray’s chosen men have shared power at the Centre and in the state, but he has also essayed the role of the opposition leader, calling out Prime Minister Modi on governance, or throwing the gauntlet to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on state issues. Thackeray’s 48-minute speech – middling in its content, delivered with attempted bombast, devoid of dramatic flourishes or hold-your-breath announcements – left Sainiks and listeners confused on this issue. Thackeray has either not resolved the dilemma yet, or he isn’t letting on. But he did not clearly call for ousting the governments. He criticised the governments for their decisions but did not explain why Sena’s ministers in those cabinets did not protest at the appropriate time. He avowed that the Shiv Sena’s   (saffron flag) will fly in Delhi and Mumbai next year. But he did not say how that would be possible when the party does not have a pan-India presence. He touched on the duality, the non-tenability, of his being simultaneously an ally and an opposition-like voice. But he only asked a rhetorical question: should he remain silent even as his government conducts itself in an anti-people manner. That is neither here nor there. In the end, it did not matter that Thackeray lambasted the government on issues: for the   they have got from fuel prices burdening the common man; for the snap decision on demonetisation and hollow claims for rooting out black money; for the tardy handling of farm crisis and Maharashtra’s drought; for the slide in the rupee (“Pramod Mahajan asked me what I dream for India when a dollar cost Rs 37, I said I wanted the reverse. Now it’s double that and Modi is perhaps waiting for it to be Rs 150 a dollar”); for Modi’s inability to rescind Article 370; for his government’s directionless policy on relations with Pakistan (“soldiers die…but the PM goes to cut a birthday cake”), and so on. Sample these. “There was a “hawa” (wave) in 2014; that is no longer around, the atmosphere has changed”, or “in the country’s horoscope, Shani and Mangal have become maleficent; we know how to straighten them out”, or “You are said to be Vishnu’s 11th avatar, but you cannot control and bring down prices?” or “You travel all around the world and because of you I learned about hitherto unheard of countries on the world map, but you couldn’t travel to Ayodhya?”, or “What is the meaning of asserting that they will be in power for 50 years when the Pradhan Sevak and mukhya sevaks (chief ministers) have to criss-cross states to win elections?” Thackeray hit out as hard as he could have, but the barbs did not really hurt. He threw not a dare, but what might be called ‘half a dare’. Half a challenge. Half a threat. That, for the 2019 election, is not good enough. Sitting in the government, yet opposing it seems like a fixed match. Devoid of strong content, characteristic bombast, and risqué language that Shiv Sainiks are used to hearing from Thackeray’s father, Uddhav sounded tired or acting out his part. And, the dilemma hung heavy. Together, it explains why he went back to the tried-and-tested agenda – Hindutva. Thackeray’s choicest words and strongest emotions were reserved for this theme. He declared that he would personally head to Ayodhya on 25 November, take the   and saints into confidence, and get started on building the Ram Mandir. “Will you build it or should we,” he demanded to know from Prime Minister Modi, “if the Ram Mandir promise was also a , then the Shiv Sena will gather every Hindu of the country to do that… (Then) this isn’t an NDA  , there’s something wrong with its DNA”. Contained in it was also a message to Shiv Sainiks who have been rather upset at the inaction, the softening as it were, of their party: get ready for action. When the Babri masjid was demolished, Shiv Sena was there, he reminded them. “When leaders had gotten scared of the consequences, Balasaheb was the only one to proudly declare that his boys had brought down the dome… similarly in the early 90s, he was the one who without fear popularised the slogan ‘Garv se kaho hum Hindu hain’, Sena made sure that Hindus survived and were awakened,” he said. Within Maharashtra, the word and its connotations were associated with Savarkar. Outside the state, radical so-called fringe groups of the sangh parivar used to speak it. But not the BJP. Well before the BJP embraced Hindutva, the Shiv Sena had. In the 1987 by-election in Bombay’s suburb of Vile Parle, campaigning for his candidate Ramesh Prabhoo, Thackeray Senior had thundered on about the need for Hindus to unite and about Hindutva being the lode star of the country. That speech was challenged on electoral malpractice grounds under the Representation of People’s Act, and the Supreme Court later had handed down a six-year ban to him. But it had caught popular imagination. Pramod Mahajan then took it to his party’s national executive, LK Advani’s  was conceptualised and realised, and the rest is divisive and bloody history. This “flaming Hindutva” is what Uddhav wants to return to. In 2018, caught in the dilemma that he is, it will be his best bet in the election, he reckons. That the RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat asked Modi’s government to bring in a law to build Ram Mandir in his Vijaya Dashami speech, may have taken some wind from Thackeray’s sail. But to his cadre and the public, he made his side clear on an issue that will, unfortunately but in all probability, dominate the next election. He could have upped the ante on any issue but he chose the Mandir issue. This issue, complete with its emotiveness and throwback to “the good times of Sena” is likely to energise the party’s cadre more than price rise or farmers’ plight. This return to “flaming Hindutva” has already showed up in posters across Mumbai and other cities, of Ram as the warrior god, with Sena’s symbol, bow-arrow, prominently featuring on them. “The bow-and-arrow is ours,” he told his audience of nearly a lakh, “it does not require a 56-inch chest, it requires strong wrists/hands, and we have them.” The game is here is to be the “better” or more aggressive Hindu, to demonstrate a deeper shade of saffron. Maharashtra is likely to witness   battles, even if the BJP and Sena handshake an alliance for the elections next year.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Alok Prasanna Kumar,"The quiet, internecine war going on between the top officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has burst out into the open in a dramatic fashion this week. Inevitably, the matter has landed in the courts – Verma filed a   in the Supreme Court challenging the government’s move to divest him of his duties, and has been duly followed by RK Asthana. In the first hearing on Friday, the Supreme Court has given the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) ten days to complete the enquiry, supervised by former Supreme Court judge, Justice (Retd) A K Patnaik. The obvious questions arise – if Alok Verma was justified in proceeding against RK Asthana why has he been divested of his powers? If he wasn’t, why has RK Asthana been acted against? Especially since even the temporary in-charge of the CBI does not  . The Supreme Court has also directed that the temporary-in-charge cannot take any “policy decisions” but may only take up day to day issues of the CBI. Formally and legally, Verma is still Director of the CBI even if he is not permitted by the CVC and the government from carrying out his functions. He has not been “removed” from office under any law but he is also not permitted to carry out the functions of his office under law. He and Asthana are in a weird twilight zone (or Trishanku state if you prefer) when it comes to their posts. Should the inquiry report find nothing against Verma, the government would have no basis to insist that he continue on leave. It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court passes the same kind of order in the context of Asthana also. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court’s order is entire fair and balanced, keeping in mind the circumstances and the potential damage the situation could have wrought. Could the government have divested him of his duties? Legally, the government can claim that they have acted only on the advice of the CVC, the body set up to supervise the functioning of the CBI. After all, even the committee comprising the prime minister, leader of opposition and Chief Justice of India are just a recommending authority and the central government is the appointing authority under law. Can the CVC recommend thus? Section 8 of the CVC Act gives them broad powers of superintendence – save for managing the outcome of an investigation this can mean anything. Does this necessarily mean the power to divest the CBI director of his or her powers? This is where things get complicated. Do the Central Civil Services Rules (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules 1965 apply in all respects to the office of the Director of CBI? Even when there is a subsequent Parliamentary law in place, namely the CVC Act which might potentially conflict with it? There is much for the courts to clarify though it remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will choose to do so in Verma’s case. That said, the CBI is not the only institution where there is a legal grey zone – consider the events of the last year in the Supreme Court itself. The controversy over the MCI Bribery case which had the potential to implicate the Chief Justice of India in a corruption case was one of a dispute between the top two judges of the Supreme Court as to what was the right thing to do in the matter. It is a different matter that the   but it highlights how much of our institutions depend on good faith and principles to function rather than hard and fast rules and procedures. The Chief Justice of a High Court may divest a High Court judge without formally calling for her removal through impeachment. Likewise, the CJI with a CJ of a High Court, but what of the CJI herself? Who would be the authority to divest the CJI of powers should the CJI be found to be acting in a manner prejudicial to the court? As with the Supreme Court, so with the CBI – government interference and the failure to uphold the highest norms in appointment and functioning have created this problem in the first place.

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"The targeting of migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and even Madhya Pradesh as proxies for the man who allegedly raped an infant girl almost a fortnight ago in Sabarkantha district in north Gujarat, has unfortunately been given a political tinge although this should have been seen as symptomatic of the flaw in the so-called Gujarat model. The attacks which resulted in numerous migrants fleeing Gujarat overnight – a petition filed in Gujarat High Court claims   have fled the state with dreams bundled on their heads and shoulders with children in tow, is actually evidence of the state's socio-economic fabric being unable to cope with the legitimate demands and rising aspirations of the people. Consequently, as it has happened quite often in the past, people identified the imaginary ‘other’ who was blamed for all their ills. Like in most cases, this time too it were the hapless migrants who were targeted. That the anger against migrants was directed for other reasons is evident from the fact that the attacks started well after the alleged rapist was arrested. Revenge attacks often take place when the accused is either unidentified or on the run. In this case however, the alleged rapist was nabbed within half an hour of the girl child going missing. Despite this, messages began circulating among villages close by. Following this, attacks were launched the same night on factories employing mainly migrant workers. It is clear from the chain of events that anger was not directed at just the accused. Because the victims had no connection with the crime except that they were also migrants, it is obvious that the fury against the targeted was for different reasons. But it must be kept in mind that Thakor remains a leader who is yet to shed his primary moorings –he emerged on the scene by mobilising the OBC community, primarily Thakors, against the Hardik Patel-led demand for job reservations for his community. He is simply a product of his time and is backed by people whose angst he articulates, just as Modi did in 2002. Hindutva as a political idea is certainly not uniting people anymore in the face of community-specific grievances. Now they are seeking inclusion in the list because it will entitle them to privileges. At the root of this problem is ceaseless fragmentation of agricultural and urban land with the passing of every generation, coupled with the failure of the new economy to absorb new job seekers. Gujarat has a long history of in-migration, partly due to manual labour not being the most preferred job among most Gujarati communities possibly due to the dominating influence of the state's entrepreneurial culture. In such a situation, the industry, starved of good talent – skilled or unskilled – provided adequate facilities to migrant workers to woo and retain them. There has been a consistent rise in the number of migrants year after year, and many have stayed on to make Gujarat their home, especially in industrial centres like Surat. There has also been little effort to study issues confronting native residents of the state, and counsel youth to alternate professions. Rising frustration has led to almost ceaseless social unrest since 2015. Instead of conceptualising long-term solutions, the state government, with backing from the party leadership, decided to prioritise issues raised by the industry, and the migrant population which has emerged as a last-minute vote bank. One such matter which prevented the industry from retaining workers, was the 15-year period before they could secure domicile status. This emerged as a major issue earlier in the year when the government made it mandatory for students to submit the   while seeking admissions to medical and paramedical courses in the state. As a result, the Vijay Rupani government mooted earlier this year, to reduce the period of residency from fifteen years to two years, to become a domicile of Gujarat. Days before violence against the migrants broke out, Rupani   at an event in Ahmedabad, “those who set up business in Gujarat, including the service sector, will have to ensure that 80 percent of the jobs are given to Gujaratis.” Obviously, the government is trying to please both migrants and natives: on the one hand it is reducing the waiting period for domicile status from 15 years to 2 years and on the other hand it is introducing an 80 percent reservation in industrial jobs for domiciles of Gujarat. This is mere plumbing because the problem of alienation of Gujarati urban youth will begin staring it in the face within just a couple of years the moment thousands of people start becoming domiciles of the state. It is yet to be seen what the state government proposes to do with these two ideas. Alpesh Thakor clearly used the rape of the infant to put the issue of agitating Gujarati OBC youth on the forefront. Blaming him may enable the BJP to score a political point and its success can be discerned from Thakor's decision for a Modi-style  (fast for goodwill). But painting this conflict as an instance of ‘political grandstanding gone awry’ will neither help BJP's cause nor enable the state government to contain local anger and ensuring industrial tranquillity. In 2013, Modi claimed in election meetings that Gujarat was an ideal state and migrants from all over north India went to the state for work. “The moment their trains cross into Gujarat, their families feel secure,” he had claimed in several meetings. The BJP will hope this claim is not recalled by people.  ‘ ’   ‘ ’     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

S Pushpavanam,"The death of over 62 people in the train accident near Amritsar has sent shock-waves across the country. The Prime Minister issued a statement on Twitter as per the usual; the countless injured are being treated at hospitals, while ex gratia compensations have been announced for families of the deceased. But – what next ? The   tragedy is the attitude of the Railways who never learn. They have once again dumped blame on the public and the local administration who, they say, should have provided security to the people at the event. To those who are in alignment with the through process of the Indian Railways, let me tell you why they should be the ones to take the first call of responsibility. From the photographs it appears that the difference between the level of the railway track and that of the ground on which the festivities were being held, was not much. A railway track is usually at a height of 4 ft supported by ballasts on either side. This is precisely to provide a support base for the track and to prevent animal and humans from crossing. These ballasts effectively act as a barrier. Now, there is something known as a ‘monsoon patrol’. That is, two linesmen ought to start from two neighboring stations in opposite directions, so as to meet each other at a central point, exchange batons and report an abnormality. They are supposed to do this patrol during a ‘civil disturbance’ of any kind, as well. As Dussehra was approaching, such a mass gathering could have been easily anticipated seeing that a public ground like Dhobi Ghat was next to the railway tracks. The Railways should have provided a patrol squad and security. For instance in Tiruchirappalli, Southern Railway, when the train passes the Cauvery river on the 18th day of the Aadi month when people assemble in large numbers on the banks to perform   for the river, it is customary for young boys to jump from the top of the train into the river. Thus, RPF men are posted a few stations ahead and on the sidelines to prevent mishaps. It is to be noted that minutes before the accident causing the deaths of over 60 and injuring others, an Express train passed the area at a slow pace, which people saw, and moved away from. The train was moving slowly because it had just started moving from the Amritsar station. Less than two and a half minutes after the first (slow) train passed, according to Northern Railways officials, the second train, a DMU from Jalandhar to Amritsar, passed at a high speed. People were unable to see it, and were hit as a result. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) roads have flyovers near a town or a busy village. Why? If the NH is at the level of the village /town roads, people tend to cross over, and to prevent that from happening, flyovers are built. Apply this to the Railways. In places where there is no level crossing, the height of the track is raised to 4 feet, partly to make crossing over difficult. Railways can put up boards like the NHAI, that some spots are accident-prone and fix a flash and alarm device particularly when the difference between the road level and the track level is not much. If there had been a flash device, even when the sound could not be heard, people would have seen the flash warning. That is how it is in all developed countries. The railway authorities claimed that they had not given any permission to the Dussehra gathering. That means the ground was Indian Railways land. Then they ought to have posted RPF men as it is done for local festivals in other Indian Railways grounds. Having been negligent in not providing security, it is strange that the Government Railway Police (GRP) should have filed an FIR against unknown persons. If at all, it is the relatives of the dead who should file an FIR against the Railways. The public on their part are also squarely responsible. An avoidable tragedy like this would have never occurred had they been a bit careful and aware. They have had to pay with their lives for this. But the Railways? They will get away, as they have usually gotten away with several accidents. The Railways has a Safety Commission. To impress upon us their impartiality, they attach it to the Civil Aviation Ministry. But to protect their own vested interests, they man the Railway Safety Commission with their own deputed officers or retired officers. How nice! The Parliamentary Standing Committee report on the action taken on its recommendations says (SCR 188 2013-14) that only less than 40 percent of the money allotted for safety had been utilised by the Railways in the preceding two years. What happened after that? Of course, they made it a non-lapsable fund. The HR Khanna Committee on Safety recommended that DRM and GM should take responsibility for accidents to ensure safety. But these bureaucrats ensured their own safety by throwing this recommendation in the dustbin. Piyush Goyal need not resign. But if he could transfer/suspend/dismiss a few DRMs and GMs, every time a train derails or is involved in a fatal accident, he would be doing a service to the nation – and would be setting a strong precedent – one of accountability, where it belongs.

Payal Mohanka,"    This is not a #MeToo piece. I am merely strolling down memory lane. Just after my graduation in 1982, I headed to   office in Calcutta. The paper had been launched that very year. The Editor MJ Akbar was the superstar of journalism, after a successful tenure at  , the magazine he had been editing for six years before   was born. I was desperate to be a journalist. It was difficult as I came from a conservative family that had never seen a woman work, but I was determined. At 22 if you were interested in journalism in Calcutta,  there was just one role model: MJ Akbar.   had taken the city by storm. A dynamic, energetic editor who showed the city its sordid underbelly. The state took him to court, but Akbar stood his ground and won the case. I had even gone to court for the final hearing. Those were the days when this messiah took on the system and fought for neglected sections of society. With stars in my eyes and idealism writ large on my face, I went for my   interview. But rejection can sometimes be a blessing. A year later, I was selected by   as a trainee journalist, and left for Bombay. After a year’s internship, I had a confirmed job at the  , the magazine where Akbar had begun his journalistic career. Somewhere deep within, his words still hurt. While I was home in Calcutta on vacation, I actually wrote to the iconic editor in 1984, “Sir, I would like to thank you. If you hadn’t sat like an omniscient oracle and told me that journalism was a tough profession and not the right one for me, maybe I wouldn’t have worked with such determination. However, I would like to bring to your notice the fact that your judgement is not necessarily infallible...” About two weeks later, a hand-delivered note arrived from the superhero. “My dear Payal, If your journalism is as good as your letter — and on the evidence of the clipping it could be — then you will go a long way... I would be the last person to claim infallibility. I truly hope that you prove me very, very, very wrong. If there is anything I can do to help, let me know. MJ, Friday, 28th Sept, 1984”. I was very happy with my job in Bombay. I thanked Akbar for offering his help but truly didn’t require anything more than his good wishes. The pain of that first job rejection, the tears on the bus back home, the emotional upheaval of not wanting to tell your parents how badly that first interview had gone as they were dead against the job in any case... slowly melted into oblivion. My pride had been restored. The hero of Indian journalism had given this 24-year-old, a stamp of approval. I cherished these letters. Four years later, I was back in Calcutta with the  . And in 1989, I found myself heading to   office to do a four-page interview with the great Akbar himself. Akbar, then a huge Rajiv Gandhi loyalist, had been sued for defamation by Ajeya Sigh, son of VP Singh, contender for the throne.   had alleged that Ajeya Singh had stashed millions of US dollars in the Caribbean island of St Kitts. Battle lines had been drawn between media houses too. While  supported V P Singh and his son,   was blatantly favouring the Congress.  The truth was a casualty in the process. During that interview, I saw anger and aggression. Akbar didn’t like some of the questions and even asked me if I had been sent by Arun Shourie who was at the time editor of   I had to tell him to calm down and please answer my questions. He then wanted to see the interview before it was published. I transcribed the entire interview and sent him the hand-written draft. He went through it... put his pen through large passages, and in long hand even wrote, “I don’t want to get into all this. Nor do I want to answer questions best addressed to bankers. I don’t know the real details and should not have made any assumptions.” And here, he was losing his cool while being interviewed. After the interview was published, I was surprised to find another hand-written ‘thank you’ note from MJ Akbar. Interestingly two months later, the object of MJ Akbar’s virulent media attack, ie, VP Singh, became the  country's prime minister. As many women journalists (some of whom I know personally) share angst-ridden stories of a predator boss, I feel an overwhelming sense of pain and anguish. As a woman, I wonder whether so many of these ladies would fabricate such charges? The indictment has been formally denied by Akbar and he has taken the matter to court. “Irreparable damage” is a terrible thing: whether it is to Akbar's reputation, or the psyche of the survivors. May the truth prevail. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Revati Laul,"In this Republic of Fakes that we live in – us, the deliverers of fake news, and them, the creators of it; we can all perhaps agree on one thing: ghosts. This takes me back to a hot summer afternoon in Delhi’s Nehru Place. I was a television reporter with NDTV. And before the budget, I was tasked with getting vox pops or voices from the people, on what their expectations were. As I shoved the trademark red NDTV mike in the face of a man sitting on the stairs in the dusty marketplace – home to the Microsoft office and also every grey market computer seller. Before I could ask him anything about money or the budget, he had a question for me.   (Is the world turning upside down?) He mistook me for the tabloid station India TV that had broadcast a soothsayer who predicted that in the next ten days the world was going to turn turtle. Ignorant me rubbished the news at the time but I now I think it was truly prophetic. Think about it. The CBI seems to be carrying so many ghosts, that it turned completely upside down. Some say the CBI’s Special Director Rakesh Asthana, now facing charges of bribery, carries ghosts that go all the way back to his days as investigating officer in Gujarat, who pronounced in 2002, that the Godhra train bogey that caught fire, killing 59   was a well-planned conspiracy. Distorting scientist Isaac Newton’s laws of physics so that the mob could be seen as the spontaneous combustion of angry Hindus after the train bogey was burnt. When Asthana was made the number 2 man in the country’s top investigating agency, ghosts in the system and naysayers outside it whispered – look at the man’s smoke-trail… is there a law of physics at work? As allegations against Asthana got louder and the heat too much to bear, a curious ghostly glow directed our gaze elsewhere – to the man directly above him. In a haze of allegations and counter allegations, there were whispers that the CBI director was asked to go on leave after midnight on Tuesday, along with a slew of officers that were allegedly poking their noses into cases Asthana was investigating. The only thing that is amply clear is that wherever you look, reality has morphed into exciting macabre scenes from Macbeth. “Fair is foul and foul is fair.” If only it had no consequences in the real world. Every night, our TV screens are crowded by people calling out each other’s ghosts. And while our country’s investigating agencies are turning each other upside down, we are going into a season of state elections where no facts are in the mix at all. The fact that diesel prices are going through the roof and this matters most to farmers who need every last drop for their tractors. Instead, their very real and tragic voices are reduced to parodies on TV, night after night. The news showcases those ridiculous and stubborn farmers who unthinkingly burn their stubble to clear their fields for the next crop, causing the air in cities in North India to clog up with smoke. But no one wants to give these farmers reasons for their ridiculousness, where the joke is actually on us. We, who want more food, more luxury, more everything, no real politics, no real responsibilities in the part we play in invisible-ising farmers’ distress, so our markets and the pleasures they afford us as consumers continually expand. Meanwhile in rural India… …I spoke with an old, trusty farmer friend who is also a socialist and a political activist. He is a rich farmer by the standards of Bundelkhand, one of the poorest districts in Uttar Pradesh on the state’s border with Madhya Pradesh. So he gets by. He has enough to eat unlike most of his fellow agriculturists. “You know Revati,” he said, his voice heavy and weary, “there’s marking out going on in our area for land to be acquired for the expressway. And farmers whose lands are marked out are celebrating   – as if it’s a festival.” “Every farmer is desperately trying to sell his land for any price at all.” This wasn’t the case ten years ago, he added. Overall, the price per bag in UP has gone up Rs 490 per bag between March and October, my farmer friend said. And the math for the rice and wheat growing farmers is appalling. It costs about Rs 1,500 to grow a quintal of rice and what a farmer can expect to get for it in today’s market is just about 1700. Imagine the small and marginal farmers who only have 2 or 3 bighas of land – which in Bundelkhand means they can grow upto 4 quintals per bigha or 8 on two. That means he earns Rs 1,600 on 2 bighas of land – for an entire agricultural season. So they don’t grow rice or wheat if they have such small tracts of land. That wouldn’t just be suicidal. It’s inconceivable. Suicide, you see, isn’t all that inconceivable any more. So the small and marginal farmers grow vegetables. And we’ve seen many farmers agitations these last couple of seasons with the vegetables being tossed out onto inter-state highways because farmers are so fed up with not getting even basic sustenance prices from the market for growing them. Are farmers not meant to have any aspirations? In an election season, Modi and Amit Shah and their election team must be worried about the extreme, and nation-wide rural distress. Perhaps the ghost of things to come in the state elections around the corner and the national elections next year are making them paranoid enough to not allow any dissent.

Gandhi also said that the PM did not seek the decision of the 3-member committee that approves the removal of the CBI director. Gandhi had also spoken on the matter on Wednesday, 24 October. In a tweet, Gandhi said that Alok Verma (CBI Director) was removed because “Verma was collecting documents related to the Rafale scam. He has been sent on leave forcefully. The prime minister's message is absolutely clear – that whoever comes close to the Rafale deal, that person would be removed. The country and the constitution are in danger.""

He was referring to the Unnao rape case against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh.

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"Among whispers heard in the course of the bitter fracas within the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – besides the dramatis personae – several other names have cropped up, for the role they allegedly played. But besides officials, the name of Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah also cropped up in the battle, which has deep ramifications, and has certainly not left the top echelons of the regime untouched. This is not the first time that Shah has been mentioned as a player in a big debate, divergence or disagreement – playing out in the epicenter of power in India. To understand these two points, one has to go back in time, when the first steps of these arrangements were worked out. This exercise may provide clues to help us decode if Shah has emerged as a power-center in his own right, or if he remains what he initially was: a loyal trouble-shooter for  . Among various questions that took centre stage in the Delhi   when Narendra Modi became prime minister, was the one pertaining to the party’s role thereon. Would this follow the Vajpayee era model, when the party mostly played second fiddle? The Vajpayee era model had led to several such episodes when organisational leaders worked at cross-purposes with the government, because undercut saffron apparatchiks were keen on striking back. Related to this was also the sort of relationship Modi would share with the RSS top brass – would it remain as hostile as in the Vajpayee era, or would his personal relationship with Mohan Bhagwat lead to a turnaround in Sangh Parivar-government ties, ensuring that Nagpur stopped operating through proxies? The answer to these questions at that time depended on the model Modi would follow. Would he follow the Congress model – with the party becoming an appendage of the government – or, would he follow the CPI(M) model – of the party virtually controlling the government? Would it be a man after Modi's heart, or would there be someone who would stand up to him and be more favourably inclined towards the Sangh leadership and others in the party who grudgingly accepted Modi's leadership? Eventually, Modi had his way. The moot point was, whether Shah would remain a mere Modi adjunct or if he would acquire an independent identity. Would Shah be just a chief publicist or would he also contribute to Modi's further ascendance? At a time when it is often being said that a BJP encore in 2019 will be more dependent on Shah's abilities to steer the campaign and less on Modi's charisma, there is a need to recognise that the former did not choose the easy way after becoming party president. Moreover, the innovative way he went about making BJP the largest political party (on paper) in the world, and secured publicity in reams in reel hours, ensured the construction of the Shah enigma. Yet, it must be recognised that Modi provided Shah with the space and independence he has allowed no one since becoming prime minister. It has obviously led to occasional natural divergences but the two have managed the situation well because their laser focus on collective long-term goals. This is especially true during elections, and there are numerous instances of a Modi ‘wish’ – a ticket to someone – denying a nomination to another and shifting the seat of yet another – which have not been followed by Shah. The party president is possibly the only man in the country who can get away without heeding a desire of the prime minister. Can Shah ever be the power that he is without Modi's backing? Will he ever have a future, independent of the man who mentored him from the mid-1990s? If ever a like confrontation takes place between the two, and the Amitabh Bachchan-like Shah asks of Modi   or, ‘what is that you have which I don't’, Modi will have just one line to say: ‘ ’ – ‘I have the support of the people’. The real thing is the charismatic man who has repeatedly turned election campaigns on its head – Karnataka and Gujarat most recently. It is undeniable that Shah is vital for Modi's return in 2019. But Shah succeeds only because he has a product like the latter to market. Take away the product, and Shah will lose his identity. Modi will survive an odd setback or two, but Shah will find it tough to recover. Beneath the image of a no-nonsense man who is merciless to opponents, Shah remains a soft target who is protected by the man who has hoisted him to where he is today.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik announced the scrapping of the deal saying “it was full of frauds” which has been established and officers involved identified. Malik said that the entire process has been carried out in a quiet manner and even the tenders were opened on holiday to suit a company, a Kashmir daily reported. The Group Mediclaim Insurance contract to cover around 400,000 government employees and pensioners was allotted by Governor Satya Pal Malik’s administration to Reliance General Insurance Company (RGIC) at a time when its promoter Anil Ambani was embroiled in the Rs 59,000-crore Rafale deal controversy. Until September 2018, people in Jammu and Kashmir had their curiosity confined to the purported funding of a French film by one of Ambani’s companies for which the shooting was to be facilitated at the exquisite locales of Ladakh. It had been widely reported in international media that one company of Ambani’s group had been made the offset partner of the French fighter aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. This was after a French partner of Reliance, VisVires Capital, had financed 15 percent (1.48 million Euros) budget of Rouge International’s film  , released in December 2017. Rouge International happened to be the production house of the then French President Francois Hollande’s partner, actress Julie Gayet. The contract, that had been left under wraps for months by former Governor NN Vohra, was approved on 31 August 2018 in the first State Administrative Council (SAC) meeting chaired by Governor Malik. Even as all the major government tenders are floated online on behalf of the Governor or President of India, the Group Mediclaim Insurance was advertised by a private broker, M/S Trinity Reinsurance Brokers Ltd, poorly in a couple of newspapers. IRDA-recognised Trinity was engaged by the J&K government to “design and implement” the Chief Minister’s Group Mediclaim Insurance Policy. All the related documents are available on the Finance Department’s website. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Trinity and J&K government is conspicuously missing. Officials haven’t responded to these questions: The previous notification dated 16 February 2018 which was cancelled in March, had mentioned that only the insurance companies having a footprint in J&K and turnover of Rs 5,000 crore in the financial year 2017-18, would be eligible for participation in the competition. “There was only one company in the Rs 3,000 crore – Rs 4,000 crore category. The criterion was obviously lowered to make it eligible. It was entertained even as it had no footprint in J&K. Why didn’t they bring it down to Rs 1,000 crore? It would have spurred better competition and the premium per employee would have been not more than Rs 3,000 a year,” a trade union leader who wishes to stay anonymous, argued. The government has allotted the mediclaim insurance contract to RGIC on its quoted premium of Rs 8,776.84 per employee and Rs 22,228 per pensioner. The company has the obligation of providing cashless treatment at 4,700 government-run and private hospitals across India to employees and pensioners of the J&K government to the cap of Rs 6 lakh a year. The policy holder with five dependent family members will be entitled to reimbursement of the expenditure of up to Rs 6 lakh, during hospitalisation. As the scheme has been made compulsory for all serving employees, they will be getting Rs 3,600 in premium from the government, but it will be optional for the retired employees. Employees of public sector undertakings, autonomous bodies and universities, besides accredited journalists (without any premium support from the government) are also entitled to get themselves plus five dependent family members insured under this policy. “Media has been pretty unfair and much of the coverage about this scheme has been subjective. It’s being projected as if we have given this contract to Reliance on a platter without floating tenders. I was worried that the company shouldn’t back out. Our previous vendor ICICI Lombard had reportedly suffered losses over premium of around Rs 6,200. This time they had quoted as high as Rs 17,692,” Mr Choudhary told  . According to Mr Choudhary, three private insurance companies and four PSUs of the Government of India participated in the competition. Two of the PSUs got disqualified in the technical evaluation. The rest of the five bidders quoted the following premium rates: “Most of the perceptions and judgments in such matters, as also resultant criticism, happen to be wrong. We have put out an exhaustive policy document. It contains a host of conditions and parameters. The number and quality of the empaneled hospitals, number of the family members to be benefitted, whether it is Rs 5 lakh or Rs 6 lakh a year, quality of the services at call centre and web portal, promptness in settling claims and much more is assessed before selecting a vendor. We assess the rates in realm of totality to the best satisfaction of our analysts. We are fully convinced that we have struck the best deal,” Mr Choudhary asserted. In response to a question over the non-existence of the tender notice on e-tender portals of the J&K government and the poor publicity given to it, Mr Choudhary said: “These big insurance companies are not based in small towns of our state. We called all the majors for a pre-bid meeting and they all had full knowledge of our NIT. They offered different suggestions which we considered on merit. It’s a fully transparent and fool-proof exercise,” he asserted. One official in the Finance Department added, “Politics is being played on it unnecessarily.” He said a Congress activist had tweeted that it was Rs 11,000-crore contract. This, he claimed, “was just Rs 310 crore a year contract, but extendable to three years”. Discrepancies are still galore in different claims of the officials in the J&K government. The Principal Secretary of Finance asserted that as many 4,700 government and private hospitals had been empanelled for providing cashless treatment to the insured. The operator on the service provider’s call centre put the number at “around 3,500”, while adding that the process was still in progress. A list of the hospitals provided to accredited journalists mentions just 123 hospitals, mostly the government hospitals at district and sub-district level in the state. The Finance Department’s website carries a list of only 20 private hospitals—just two in Srinagar. Leaders of Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC) claimed that RGIC had no presence in the health insurance sector in J&K. They said that the company had been admonished for its bad track record by different states, particularly the Government of Haryana. In a brazen violation of the contract, it had rejected 1,423 claims. “It was only after Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar passed orders, blacklisting and initiating proceedings against it through IRDA that the company settled 886 claims and deposited an amount of Rs 8.69 crore with the Haryana government earlier this year. Around the same time, IRDA held back the final approval certificate (R-3 Certificate) without which the company cannot carry out health and medical insurance schemes,” one of the EJAC leaders claimed. EJAC Jammu President Balwinder Singh has raised questions over the annual premium being THE same (Rs 5,177 by employee and Rs 3,600 by government) for a class-IV employee who takes home just Rs 20,000 and the Chief Secretary whose gross monthly salary was around Rs 3 lakh. Trade union leaders’ demand was enhancement in the monthly medical allowance from Rs 300 to Rs 1,000. It has been fully subsumed in the premium to be paid to RGIC. “Medical allowance of Rs 300 would take care of our monthly expenditure on routine medicines. This insurance scheme is fully focused on the treatment to be provided during hospitalisation. It’s grossly flawed. How can the company charge Rs 22,228 from pensioners. It should have been equal for all, just Rs 3,000 to 4,000 a month,” said Mohammad Saleem, a middle rung official.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Vakasha Sachdev,"Why did a third judge of the Madras High Court have to pass judgment in the MLA disqualification case? On what basis had the then Chief Justice of the Madras HC, Indira Banerjee, held that the Speaker’s decision to disqualify 18 MLAs under the anti-defection law should not be interfered with? And why had Justice M Sundar instead held that the Speaker got it wrong and that the MLAs should be reinstated? With Justice M Sathyanarayanan finally delivering his judgment endorsing Justice Banerjee’s view, here’s everything you need to know about how we got here. This case arose out of a decision of the Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on 18 September 2017, in which he disqualified 18 MLAs belonging to the AIADMK party. The MLAs filed writ petitions in the Madras High Court, asking for the court to recall the Speaker’s order for being unauthorised, illegal and without jurisdiction. In writ petition cases like this one, at least two judges need to hear the case – known as a Division Bench. Chief Justice Banerjee and Justice Sundar heard lengthy legal arguments in the case, and reserved their verdict in January this year. Since both judges eventually arrived at different decisions,  , after hearing the arguments again. Till then, the status quo prevailed: The 18 MLAs remained disqualified,    . The Speaker disqualified the 18 MLAs under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India (read with the relevant Tamil Nadu Rules). The Tenth Schedule is commonly known as India’s anti-defection law, and was introduced in 1985 to prevent defections by politicians on the basis of inducements. Chief Justice Banerjee pointed out that according to the landmark case of  (SC, 1992), while courts can review the decisions of a Speaker, they can only do so if the decision of the Speaker is ‘ ’, ie, it is outrageous in its defiance of logic or moral standards. Administrative decisions can also be reviewed if there is a patent error of law, or ignores the principles of natural justice (like giving an accused party a chance to defend themselves). Justice Banerjee did not feel that this standard was met in this case, writing: As long as the Speaker’s decision was legally possible, the court could not interfere just because it may have preferred a different view. Chief Justice Banerjee therefore did not eventually express her own opinion on whether the MLAs should be disqualified, just that there were no reasons to overturn the Speaker’s decision. One other important aspect of her judgment in this case was that she distinguished this case from the   case of 2011, when the Supreme Court had overturned a decision of the Karnataka Speaker to disqualify several BJP MLAs who had similarly expressed no confidence in their chief minister. The 18 MLAs had relied on this case heavily when making their arguments. Chief Justice Banerjee noted that in that case, the MLAs had categorically said that they were not going to leave the BJP and would support any other BJP CM except BS Yeddyurappa. No such assertion had been made in this case. Justice Sundar disagreed with the Chief Justice because in his view, the tests for judicial review in the Kihoto Hollohan case had been met in this case. He identified 4 grounds on which he thought the Speaker’s decision needed to be overturned: There was a certain degree of urgency to this case since the 18 constituencies from which the disqualified MLAs had been elected have not had any representation in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for over a year now. Both the original judges of the Division Bench had made compelling arguments for arriving at the conclusions they did, and even though they reached different conclusions, they seemed to be in agreement about the legal standards to be applied. The difference in their decisions was therefore one arising out of their assessment of the facts, and how these applied to the common legal test of the  case. This does not mean that Justice Sundar’s decision was wrong; his assessment of the law was correct, and the conclusions he arrived at on the basis of the facts and evidence were entirely reasonable. The decision is therefore a great example of a healthy judiciary, where the decision of a senior judge isn’t followed blindly, and the difference of opinion is resolved according to procedure.

TS Sudhir,"If there is one thing TTV Dhinakaran does well, it is to appear unfazed in the face of a crisis. He did likewise, within minutes of the Madras High Court verdict in the case relating to the disqualification of 18 AIADMK MLAs going against his party. On Thursday, 25 October, Judge M Satyanarayanan upheld the decision of the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker to disqualify the 18 rebel MLAs of the AIADMK, owing allegiance to Dhinakaran, who had petitioned the then Governor Vidyasagar Rao seeking a change of chief minister in 2017. “It is not a setback. It is an experience. We will consult with the 18 MLAs and decide on the next course of action,” said Dhinakaran. It showed he was expecting a favourable judgment and wanted to protect his flock from ‘poachers’. Many of the disqualified MLAs even took a holy dip in the Thamirabharani river in Papanasam during the Pushkara, praying for the tides to turn against the ruling AIADMK. But the verdict has instead landed the Dhinakaran camp in deeper waters. Legally, the court has taken the position that asking for a change in leadership of the legislature party is grounds for disqualification as a lawmaker. Given that the former Chief Justice of the Madras High court, Indira Banerjee, also held the same view, the Dhinakaran camp would think twice before trying their luck in the Supreme Court. Within the group, the consensus is veering towards settling the matter in the people's court instead. That is also because if the MLAs go to the Supreme Court, it will be seen as a lack of confidence in their ability to win a by-election. It will also mean some of them are trying to effect back channel attempts at a rapprochement. The possibility of only some of them going in appeal however, cannot be ruled out. The numbers for now, make it comfortable for EPS. With the disqualification of the 18 MLAs upheld, the strength of the House, taking into account two vacancies due to bereavements, comes down to 214. The ruling AIADMK with 110 MLAs is therefore, for now, above the half way mark of 107. Rather strangely, the EC went by the state government's recommendation, that the bypolls to Thirupparankundram (represented by AK Bose) and Thiruvarur (represented by M Karunanidhi) ought not be held before December, the weather being cyclonic with heavy rain in Tamil Nadu. This will mean that the 18 plus 2 by-elections may not be held before the first quarter of 2019 and could even get pushed to be held along with the Lok Sabha elections. The dice is loaded against Dhinakaran. Anything less than 18 victories out of 20 would be seen as a setback for his camp, as it would denote erosion of confidence in Dhinakaran's leadership. One is assuming at the moment that the disqualified legislator commands the entire AIADMK voteshare in each of the 18 constituencies. That may not be necessarily true considering that Jayalalithaa in 2016, asked for votes in her name and not in the name of her candidates. Which is why the EPS camp is peddling the narrative that the rebels were trying to bring down Amma's government. On the other hand, EPS would need to target only 7 victories out of 20, in order to be safe in the numbers game inside the Assembly. He has the advantage of holding the AIADMK ‘two leaves’ symbol, and has the rank and file’s weight behind him. Even though there is anti-incumbency against the EPS regime and the government is seen as being remote controlled by the BJP, only the politically naive would dismiss Palaniswami and Co as a force of no consequence. Barring Tiruvarur, all the other 19 were AIADMK seats, which is why there will be pressure on MK Stalin to use the by-polls as a platform to mark the DMK resurgence. An also-ran performance with a few seats in the kitty, will not serve the DMK's cause. While the verdict on the face of it affirms status quo in Tamil Nadu politics, the still waters are deceptive. Dhinakaran will be under pressure to retain the loyalty of the 18 disqualified MLAs. Dhinakaran's constant boast of ‘sleeper cells’ within the AIADMK has come a cropper, as EPS has emerged as the strongest leader of the party, with the strong backing of his Gounder community and MLAs from western Tamil Nadu. Dhinakaran has the support of five more rebel MLAs. Unless they quickly retrace their steps, the possibility of the Speaker meting out similar treatment to them cannot be ruled out. The only constant is the lack of a dull moment in Tamil Nadu politics.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Congress president alleged that the BJP deceived people and siphoned off hard-earned money of farmers, poor, small businessmen to fill the pockets of the country's 15-20 big industrialists. He said that both the prime minister and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje reneged on their promise of giving jobs to youths. He slammed the prime minister over his 'sleeping elephant' remark made during his Independence speech, saying he had insulted every Indian and their ancestors by belittling contribution of people who worked for the country's progress.  AICC general secretaries Avinash Pandey and Ashok Gehlot, PCC president Sachin Pilot and other senior leaders were present at the meeting. Gandhi added the freedom of the press was being suppressed. He also stated that a Congress government would come to power in the state very soon. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint," Abhishek Sharma The government's decision to send CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana on leave amid an escalating feud within the country's premier investigative agency has triggered a political backlash from the Opposition parties, with Rahul Gandhi linking the Rafale deal to the crisis in the CBI. Taking to Twitter, the Congress president said: ""CBI chief Alok Verma was collecting documents related to the Rafale scam. He has been sent on leave forcefully. The prime minister's message is absolutely clear – that whoever comes close to the Rafale deal, that person would be removed. The country and the constitution are in danger."" At a rally in Rajasthan's Jhalawar, he reiterated his comments, saying, ""Yesterday night, the   (referring to PM Modi) removed the CBI director because CBI was raising questions over the Rafale deal."" Not just that, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy interestingly called the appointment of Asthana – believed to be close to the Modi government – “very dubious"". Speaking to the media on the CBI crisis he said: Responding to the CBI crisis, the Congress said that ""PM Modi has buried the last nail in the independence of the CBI"". Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala wondered if Verma was ""sacked"" for his keenness to probe the ""layers of corruption"" in the Rafale scam and sought an answer from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress' Abhishek Manu Singhvi also accused the BJP-led government of 'paralysing' the investigative agency to misuse their powers. ""The prosecution agency, and the officers, have been paralysed by this government only to support an accused pinned with an extortion charge,"" he said. Meanwhile, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury asserted that the ""Modi government and the Prime Minister have conducted a political coup against the CBI."" Other prominent Opposition leaders, including Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee, Tejashwi Yadav and MK Stalin, took to Twitter to slam the Modi government over the chaos in the investigating agency. Questioning the appointment of Nageshwar Rao as the interim director, DMK President MK Stalin said: He also questioned whether the developments in the CBI were initiated to cover up Rafale scam investigations. On the other hand, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government's decision to remove the CBI director and special director was based on the CVC's recommendations, asserting that it was absolutely essential to restore the agency's institutional integrity and credibility. Jaitley said that the allegations by the top two officers of CBI led to a ""bizarre and unfortunate"" situation. A Special Investigation Team will probe the charges and both persons will ""sit out"" as an interim measure, he added. In a swipe at them, Jaitley said their allegations indicate they had access to what was going in the mind of the officer concerned, an apparent reference to Verma. That itself demolishes the integrity of the person they are trying to support, he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Manoj Joshi,"The signing of an internal security agreement by India and China last Monday is an indicator of the special nature of their relationship. This features competition, conflict and cooperation. We all know the points of conflict – the disputed 4,000-km border, Pakistan, the Masood Azhar issue, and the question of India’s NSG membership. Lesser known are areas of cooperation – India’s membership in the Beijing-sponsored Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, our membership in BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) and in various international bodies on a range of issues. China is India’s biggest trading partner and a large market for Chinese products, and Indian retailers are keen to acquire cheap Chinese goods to market. The new agreement can be seen as part of the new trend in Sino-Indian relations initiated by the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping earlier this year. The pact focuses on terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, intelligence sharing and disaster management. The significance of the agreement is obvious from the fact that the signatory on the Indian side was the Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and the Chinese Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi. Negotiations for the agreement began in 2015 following Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to China. Initially, the Chinese wanted separate agreements for the different issues, but in the wake of Wuhan, they accepted the idea of an umbrella agreement. The Wuhan summit itself came after the two-month standoff between the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army in the India-China-Bhutan trijunction on Doklam plateau. Besides Doklam, Sino-Indian relations had been roiled by the Chinese refusal to support India’s candidacy to the Nuclear Supplier’s Group and to put a hold on India’s efforts to have Jaish-e-Muhammad chief Masood Azhar put on a UN list relating to terrorism. In turn, the Chinese were unhappy over New Delhi using the Tibet card by inviting the head of the Tibetan Central Administration Lobsang Sangay to Prime Minister Modi’s inauguration, and to have a Union Minister welcome the Dalai Lama to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. Having used megaphone diplomacy to assail China for not supporting our NSG or Masood Azhar case, New Delhi is now using an orthodox diplomatic approach to persuade the Chinese of its case. So far, Indian officials say, the Chinese have not budged on these issues. But it is possible that some patient diplomacy will yield results. China, too, has worries about terrorism, emanating from separatists in Xinjiang. The Chinese are making extraordinary efforts to stamp out Islamist ideas in their western province and are sensitive to the movement of Uighurs around the world. Beyond these high-profile issues, the agreement will be of practical use to deal with issues of mutual interest, such as narcotic smuggling, human trafficking, and disaster management. With the movement of Indians and Chinese in each other’s countries, there are often issues relating to arrests and imprisonment of their respective nationals. The agreement can pave the way for dealing with such issues and lead to the signing of an extradition treaty between the two countries. Beyond terrorism, India also wants an agreement to deal with transnational crimes and cyber crimes, and to deal with white-collar criminals, as China has well-known capabilities in the cyber area. The agreement will feature an important component of exchange of information that will help in pre-empting criminal acts. Towards this end, the plan is to set up a 24x7 hotline to facilitate the exchange of information. The agreement has little to do with the Sino-Indian border dispute, which is handled through other mechanisms and agreements. But it will definitely deal with cross-border infiltration and, more importantly, disaster management. Because rivers flow from China into India, there are often situations where forewarning is vital to prevent casualties from floods or landslides downriver. An interesting sidelight of the meeting were the activities of Kiren Rijiju, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, who hails from Arunachal Pradesh – a state claimed in its entirety by China. His absence had provoked questions from the media and it is believed that he was told at the last minute to participate in the signing ceremony. The Wuhan summit has set the tone of the Sino-Indian relations in the current period. It is aimed at getting the two countries to manage the difficult areas of their relationship and find areas of convergence, and also promote better coordination between them.  The summit also sends an important signal globally, that the two countries are quite capable of handling their differences through dialogue and discussion.

Anna Isaac,"The fate of the Edappadi Palaniswami-led government could very well be in the Madras High Court’s hands. All eyes will be on the high court on Thursday, 25 October, when it pronounces its verdict on the disqualification of 18 All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MLAs. Earlier in June, the court delivered a split verdict, referring the case to a third judge – Justice M Sathyanarayanan. The 18 AIADMK MLAs were disqualified by Speaker P Dhanapal on 18 September, and a gazette notification was issued declaring that vacancies to their seats have arisen due to the Anti-Defection Act. The MLAs, who were supporting ousted AIADMK Deputy General Secretary, now AMMK leader and RK Nagar MLA TTV Dhinakaran, were disqualified on the grounds that they had “voluntarily given up their party membership”. They had in August filed individual petitions with then Governor Vidyasagar Rao expressing a lack of confidence in Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy and withdrew support to him. Calling the Speaker’s decision illegal and unauthorised, the MLAs moved the High Court seeking that the Speaker’s decision be quashed and their constitutional right be restored. While hearing the case, the Madras High Court had, on 20 September, ordered a stay on the notifying bye-polls to the 18 seats but refused to stay the disqualification. The court will decide whether the Speaker’s decision to disqualify the 18 MLAs despite no whip being issued holds ground and also whether he had the authority to disqualify the legislators for actions beyond the purview of the Tamil Nadu Assembly,  . Multiple scenarios can play out based on the outcome of the Madras High Court’s verdict. If the HC upholds the disqualification of the MLAs, then Tamil Nadu will witness bye-polls to the 18 constituencies. The outcome of the polls could decide the fate of the EPS government, which is sitting on a wafer-thin majority, with 114 MLAs. The DMK and its allies have 98 legislators. If DMK sweeps the bye-elections, it could bring down the AIADMK government. Stalin, however, will be just short of the magic figure of 117. What happens next is anybody’s guess. If the AIADMK, however, manages to retain most seats, EPS and his Deputy O Panneerselvam are looking at a comfortable tenure until 2021. If the HC quashes the disqualification of the 18 MLAs, then EPS may have to prove his majority on the floor of the Assembly. If the 18 MLAs, who had pledged loyalty to Dhinakaran, vote against EPS, they could bring down his government, at the risk of being disqualified yet again. Could Tami Nadu see a Dalit CM as proposed by Sasikala’s brother Dhivaharan? Or has the Mannargudi feud between Dhivaharan and Dhinakaran scotched the possibility of P Dhanapal in the CM’s chair? If the first bench comprising of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar, however, deliver a split verdict, it will buy EPS and co more time. The case will then be referred to a third judge. Whichever scenario plays out in the Madras High Court, what’s certain is that the ‘losing’ side will in all likelihood challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court. The disqualified MLAs are, Thangatamizhchelvan (Andipatti), R Murugan (Aroor), Mariappan Kennedy (Manamadurai), Kathirgamu (Periyakulam), C Jayanthi Padmanabhan (Gudiyatham), P Pazhaniyappan (Papireddypatti), V Senthil Balaji (Aravakurichi), Dr S Muthiah (Paramakudi), P Vetrivel (Peramboor), NG Parthiban (Sholingar), M Kothandapani (Tiruporur), TA Ezhumalai (Poonamallee), M Rangasamy (Thanjavur), R Thangadurai (Nilakottai), R Balasubramani (Ambur), Edhirkottai SG Subramanian (Sathur), R Kandaraj (Ottapidaram), and K Uma Maheshwari (Vilathikulam).

PTI,"Union minister Ramdas Athawale expressed the hope today that the BJP and the Shiv Sena would contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls together and claimed that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would win more than 300 seats in the general election. The Republican Party of India (RPI) chief, who is in talks with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over fighting the upcoming Telangana Assembly polls and next year's Lok Sabha election, also expressed willingness to contest the parliamentary polls from the Mumbai South Central seat. The RPI had submitted to the BJP a list of 40 seats it wished to contest in the 7 December Telangana Assembly election, Mr Athawale said. Claiming that the Dalit-Muslim ""alliance"" in Maharashtra will benefit the BJP and RPI, he said not all Dalit and Muslim voters supported Prakash Ambedkar and Asaduddin Owaisi, whose outfits had joined hands. Mr Athawale claimed that the Shiv Sena would suffer ""massive"" defeats if it chose to go alone in the Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly polls. The Union minister said his party was in talks with the BJP for contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai South Central, Satara and some other seats in Maharashtra. ""If the Shiv Sena remains in the NDA, they can leave the Mumbai South Central seat that I have decided to contest. If, however, they severe the ties with us, the RPI will stake claims over three-four seats in Maharashtra,"" he said. However, the RPI was planning to independently contest on some seats in the upcoming Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and support the BJP on the remaining seats, he said. Mr Athawale voiced support to the Centre's move to send two top Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials, including its director, on leave following a spat between them. ""Had they not fought (with each other), they would not have been removed. (Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi's allegation that their removal was linked to the Rafale deal is baseless,"" he said. The Union minister said both Hindus and Muslims should honour the Supreme Court verdict on the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, adding that the two sides should arrive at a ""compromise formula"" and allow the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque on the disputed land. Voicing support to the demand for carving out a separate Vidarbha state from Maharashtra, Athawale said he would raise the issue at the next meeting of the NDA before the Winter Session of Parliament.

Anthony Rozario,"Responding to “extraordinary and unprecedented” counter-allegations of corruption within the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Centre on Wednesday, 24 October, said it had sent the premier agency’s Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana on leave. But while the Centre divested both the officers of their functions, its press release on the matter accused Director Verma of “non-cooperation” in investigations against several CBI functionaries. What was initially a textbook case of  between Director Verma and Special Director Asthana has now spilled into the doors of the apex court, and now has a third participant, the Centre. And here’s how the contest between Verma and Centre looks like at the moment. The Centre, in its press note, asserted that despite repeated requests, Verma had not been “cooperating in making available records/files sought by the Commission relating to serious allegation.” According to the Centre, the CBI, on 24 September 2018 had assured the CVC that all requested documents would be furnished within three weeks. By not cooperating with the CVC or providing it with requested documents, the Centre says it feels that Verma, had wilfully obstructed the functioning of the commission. The Centre, in this manner, accused him of blocking the CVC from fulfilling its functions, while remaining silent on allegations made by him against Special Director Asthana. But Verma, in his prayer before the Supreme Court alleged that it was Special Director Asthana, who, after his appointment, had “stymied” decisions that “were crucial to the progress of certain investigations.” In effect, Verma argued that Asthana had misused his position to block investigations in several “sensitive cases.” Verma also accused Asthana of maligning his reputation, by making false allegations. In his plea before the apex court, Verma wrote that Asthana had “concocted evidence to impugn” his reputation, following which the CBI registered a case against him. Citing the development of an extraordinary situation, the press note maintained that CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana were divested of their duties under Section 8 of the Central Vigilance Commission, Act, 2003. Further, the government argued that it was only after careful examination, and in the “interest of equality, fair play and principles of natural justice,” that the government exercised its power under under Section 4(2) of the DPSE Act and sent both Verma and Asthana on leave. The Centre and the Central Vigilance Commission may have come up with their own explanations, but CBI Director Alok Verma isn’t convinced. He argued that the government violated established procedures in divesting him of all functions. Further, Verma contended that since the government did not follow due procedures and issued arbitrary orders, its actions lacked the principles of natural justice and thereby violated Article 14 (Right to equality), 19 (Fundamental freedom) and 21 (Right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. Verma has argued that the Centre and the CVC had violated the independence of the CBI, by-passing the authority of the high-powered committee, which alone can issue orders to divest the director.

Ashutosh,"The RSS and BJP’s relentless attack on the Nehru-Gandhi family is quite understandable. After all, the grand old family is the last stumbling block in their historical project – the building of a “Hindu Rashtra”. Sunday, 20 October, was yet another day when Modi launched a verbal attack on the Nehru-Gandhi family. On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the  , Modi declared, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, “In an effort to highlight the role of one family, efforts were made to deliberately ignore and forget contributions made by others in the independence struggle and later in creating a new India.” While it is true that the Nehru-Gandhi family has enjoyed much of the spotlight since independence as they were largely in power, but to claim that, in highlighting this family, the role of others in India’s freedom struggle has been ignored or diminished, is untruthful and misleading. In his 20 October speech, Subhash Chandra Bose’s name took centre stage. Modi, like the RSS and BJP, tried to appropriate Bose, to the extent that he donned the cap popularized by Bose’s Indian National Army (INA). But irony just shot itself in the face. It is a well-known fact that Netaji was a secular leftist and vehemently opposed communal parties like the Hindu Mahasabha. Bose was so fundamentally against communal politics that he even decried his own party, the Congress’s right-wing. Modi and the right-wing elements of the day’s appropriation of him is thus, an oxymoron. The problem with the RSS and their ideological mentors is that they have literally played   role in India’s freedom struggle, and do not have leaders in their ranks to match those who won India freedom. To thus compensate, the RSS begs, borrows and ‘steals’ (external) heroes, and makes it seem as though the Congress has been ignoring these freedom fighters or not giving them their due respect. In this endeavour to appropriate, the RSS has ‘robbed’ Sardar Patel, Bose and even Ambedkar. On 30 December 2014, the then join secretary of the RSS, Krishna Gopal, at a memorial lecture titled  ’, Indian Institute of Public Administration, Delhi, had  , that apart from championing the cause of the “untouchables”, Ambedkar was a nationalist, a staunch anti-Communist, and had deep conviction in Hinduism. According to a 2014   report, a 52-page pamphlet in Hindi titled  , authored by Krishna Gopal, was circulated at that memorial lecture. The pamphlet highlighted the “deep friendship” of Ambedkar with RSS founder K B Hedgewar, and the former’s ‘belief in  ’ (a united India). As far RSS and BJP’s appropriation of Bose goes, they have revelled in the fact that Bose and Nehru were not the best of friends. However, what they conveniently forget is that despite their rivalry, both Bose and Nehru had a common cause in their hearts: India’s independence from British rule. If it is said that Nehru felt threatened by Bose’s brilliance and oratory, then it can also be said that Bose could never accept Nehru as his leader. Bose, despite being in Congress and accepting the leadership of Gandhi, believed in resorting to violent means to attain freedom, as he famously said, “Give me blood and I will give you freedom”. Bose was young and bright, but also fascinated with Fascism. For Gandhi, non-violence was his ethos, and violence was anathema to his thinking. But then again, Like Bose, even Nehru had differences with Gandhi. In fact, the differences were so acute that in reply to Nehru’s letter in January 1928, Gandhi had written, “I see quite clearly that you must carry on an open warfare against me and my views... the difference between you and me are so vast and radical that there seems to be no meeting ground between us.” Gandhi’s letter however, shook Nehru. Nehru’s reply to Gandhi is testimony to the spiritual relationship between the two, which was not the case between Gandhi and Bose. Nehru had written, “But I have no particular banner to unfurl nor had I thought of the possibility of any warfare between you and me... is any assurance from me necessary that nothing that can ever happen can alter or lessen my deep regard and affection for you?” No doubt, Bose was an odd man out, but that did not mean Bose, Gandhi and Nehru were enemies. They had three different approaches to their shared goal of India’s independence. Why are the RSS and the BJP selectively quoting history? History should be used as a learning lesson, not as a tool to seek revenge. The hard truth is that, when Bose was raising the INA, the RSS’s first chief Hedgewar was asking his cadres to   take part in India’s freedom movement. This was the time when Gandhi had initiated the Quit India movement. At the time, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, as the deputy chief minister of Bengal, was writing a letter to the English Governor to  the Quit India movement in the state. Further, the ideological mentor of RSS and the leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, V D Savarkar, asked his followers to join the British Army to fight for Britain during World War II. Savarkar, while addressing the Hindu Mahasabha in Bhagalpur in 1941 said, “The war which has now reached our shores directly constitutes at once a danger... every branch of Hindu Mahasabha in every town and village must actively engage itself in rousing the Hindu people to join the army, navy and aerial forces and the different war craft manufactories.” Now, the same RSS, which had gone against the spirit of our freedom, is talking about Bose – one of our best remembered freedom fighters – and wants to appropriate him. Oh! The irony.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

This comes after Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) was dealt a blow when its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Piyal Nandana was arrested for alleged financial fraud on Monday. Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said that Nandana was arrested following a complaint lodged by the SLC with the Inspector General of Police. Speaking on corruption in cricket, Ranatunga – having just returned from New Delhi – said, He further added: ""We don't have the expertise or the laws to deal with this problem in a proper manner.

""There is no point in blaming the players for the poor showings,"" Ranatunga said. The arrest of the Sri Lanka Cricket CFO is related to an alleged financial fraud, which was unearthed last September. An alleged attempt to transfer (to an offshore account) USD 5.5 million – connected to the broadcasting rights of the current England tour of Sri Lanka – was reported to the police's crime investigation department. The SLC had cited the CFO Nandana as the prime suspect, who had claimed that his e-mail account had been hacked. He was sent on compulsory leave. The money was one of the three tranches coming from Sony Picture Networks for broadcast rights of the England tour.

Adrija Jayanthy ,"The furore of the #MeToo movement, unsurprisingly, has hit the shores of political parties with several allegations of sexual harassment against prominent politicians. MJ Akbar, the Minister of State for External Affairs, has been accused of sexual harassment by journalists. Sonal Kellog, a journalist, has made an accusation of sexual harassment against a UPA-1 minister. NSUI national president Fairoz Khan has stepped down from his post following charges of sexual harassment. Recently, the Centre for Accountability and Systematic Change (CASC) sent a legal notice to Maneka Gandhi, the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, requesting for political parties to be penalised for failing to protect women as per the law. While statements such as these are positive and encouraging, it remains to be seen if political parties are bound by the Sexual Harassment at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 in requirements to set-up an   to deal with sexual harassment complaints. To be registered as a recognised political party, any association of people or body of individuals (with a minimum membership of 100 people) have to apply to the Election Commission within 30 days of forming the party. The application has to be accompanied by a copy of a memorandum of rules and regulations of the association or body (they need not be called “memorandum of rules and regulations”). Thus, these associations are not mandated to have any legal status before applying to the Election Commission. Political parties can contest in elections without the “recognised political party” status and in fact are required to to do so to gain recognition by the EC. As per the Sexual Harassment at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 a ‘workplace’ is defined extremely broadly to include all types of workplaces, both formal and informal. The definition includes all government, as well as private organisations. It also includes any place where the employee visits during the course of employment, that is, during the course of executing or conducting any tasks related to their employment. By this definition, a team lunch at a restaurant can also be a ‘workplace’ and the employer is bound to protect their employees from sexual harassment there. The employers are duty-bound to protect their employees from sexual harassment; by carrying out   including the constitution of an   An ICC is to be set-up in any workplace where there are more than 10 employees. Therefore, as long as a political party has a certain number of employees at a workplace, they are bound by the laws on sexual harassment at the workplace and are required to have such a committee. They must abide by all other   in each local unit of their party that can be called a workplace.

PTI,"The Centre is ready to hold talks with anyone including Pakistan but terror and dialogue can never go together, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Srinagar, on Tuesday, 23 October. The Home Minister, who reviewed the security situation in the state, told reporters that over the past four to five months, there had been a big shift, as incidents of stone-pelting had come down and the recruitment of militants had also decreased. Singh met representatives of various political parties in Srinagar during his day-long visit and said he had appealed to all of them to participate in the upcoming panchayat polls in Jammu and Kashmir. He congratulated the state on the successful conduct of urban local bodies elections in a fair and transparent manner and said the holding of ULB and panchayat polls in the state is a historical step. Singh said those who do not believe in democracy can never be well-wishers of people. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had boycotted the recent urban bodies election in Jammu and Kashmir. Singh added that as far as talks are concerned, the government has no problem in holding dialogue with anyone. ""But there is a condition from our side. At least, they should see that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in India and promoting terrorism also. Give us this much of assurance that there will not be any such attempt by Pakistan. Terror and dialogue both can never go together,"" he said. Asked if there was any initiative to hold talks with separatists, Singh said the government will talk to anyone who is willing to enter dialogue, but refused to elaborate. ""Government will not shy away from talks. We have been saying this time and again, anyone who wants to talk, we are ready,"" he said. He also said India had made all efforts on its part but Pakistan did not take any positive step to improve ties. In response to a question, the Home Minister said the Centre had no proposal to change any constitutional provision regarding Jammu and Kashmir. ""There is no initiative by the Centre on this (Article 35-A). The provisions in the Constitution are there and the Centre has not tinkered with any of those provisions. It is difficult to answer when a non-issue is made into an issue,"" he said. The Home Minister also said that the Centre and the state government were working together to improve the life of people of the state. ""We want to engage the youth of the state in a constructive way. The state government along with the Centre has taken several initiatives in this regard. Through the Home Ministry alone, we are providing 11,000 jobs by various initiatives which will be implemented in several stages.” ""Through various schemes of the central government, steps are afoot to provide employment to nearly 2.5 lakh youths of the state. Our government will provide all assistance needed that will help the youth of the state to chart their own destiny,"" he said. On the local bodies elections, Singh said it was for the first time that an attempt has been made to empower the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh through devolution of power. “Every panchayat of the state will get Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh every year for carrying out development works in their respective areas,” he said. ""The aim of empowering these bodies is to make them autonomous so that they can resolve their issues,"" he said. On Centre's interlocutor Dineshwar Sharma, the minister said he will continue in his role till talks are held. He termed the death of seven civilians in a blast as ""very unfortunate"" after an encounter had ended in Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir and appealed to people not to venture such places where security operations were on. The minister also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for next of kin of the deceased. ""If there is an operation by security forces, I appeal the people that they should not try to go there. The security forces do take precautions and we have repeatedly directed them to do it,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Khan’s statement comes a day after he remarked about the alleged “new cycle of killings” in Kashmir “by Indian security forces”. India’s Ministry of External Affairs responded to his statement, calling it “deeply regrettable.” In a tweet, Khan said he “condemned the new cycle of killings of innocent Kashmiris.” He said India must “resolve the Kashmir dispute through dialogue in accordance with the UN SC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people”. The MEA, later in the day, asked the Pakistani leadership to “look inwards and address their own issues.” Three militants were killed on Sunday, 21 October, in an encounter with security forces in the Kulgam district of Kashmir, while six civilians lost their lives in a blast following the gunfight there. This is not the first time Khan has spoken about Kashmir. He said good India-Pakistan relations will be beneficial for the entire region.

He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act. He also attacked the BJP-led Centre over the Rafale jet deal and demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee. Pawar was replying to queries during an interaction at the ""Mumbai Manthan"" conclave organised by television news channel Aaj Tak. The feud between CBI director Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana turned murkier with the arrest of a deputy superintendent of police in the Special Investigation Team headed by Asthana, over bribery charges.

""His ministerial team does not have the capacity to deliver. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is the most powerful. All decisions are taken there and the files are sent to the ministers to sign.

PTI,"Despite its constant criticism of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena will have to ally with the BJP for the 2019 polls over the issue of Hindutva, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said Tuesday, 23 October. He also strongly favoured the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said those with even basic understanding of politics know the BJP and the Sena would have to fight together to win elections. The BJP chief minister was speaking at the ""Mumbai Manthan"" conclave organised by Hindi news channel Aaj Tak. Earlier this year, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had announced his party would go it alone in all future elections. Though the Sena is a BJP ally, it often criticises the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra over their policies and decisions. Responding to a query on Ram temple, he said. The BJP wants to let the construction happen democratically and as per Supreme Court's directive, he added. Fadnavis said the Supreme Court has validated the state government's stand on the arrest of five Left-wing activists for their alleged links with Maoists. He, however, conceded the police department erred in holding a press conference over the issue. After the arrest of activists in August-end, the Bombay High Court had raised questions over the Maharashtra police's media briefing on its case against them. Fadnavis said there are ""pseudo liberals"" in Delhi who are trying to save these activists, but what the BJP was doing was in the national interest. The police had claimed to have unearthed a Maoist plot to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The chief minister said the Opposition was not concerned about the country and it was only thinking about removing Modi from power. Fadnavis said he had no hatred for the Gandhi family and regarded its members just as his political and ideological opponents. Fadnavis said he wasn't made chief minister due to his proximity with the RSS, but because under his leadership, the BJP exposed Opposition parties and fought them. He also backed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in renaming Allahabad as Prayagraj. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday, 22 October, tweeted a graph ( ) showing the beneficiary of the Mudra yojana, which aims at extending loans to small-scale, non-corporate enterprises, and the loans sanctioned by the government under the scheme. The graph titled ‘Promoting entrepreneurship and empowering youth with financial security’ shows that the government has disbursed over Rs 6.80 lakh crore to 14.34 crore beneficiaries. The data depicted in the graph shows an upward trend in the number of beneficiaries and loans sanctioned every year since the launch of the scheme in 2015. However, as per the data used in the graph itself, in the year 2017-2018 the government disbursed Rs 2.53 lakh crore to 4.81 crore beneficiaries and in the year 2018-2019 only Rs 1.10 lakh crore was sanctioned for 2.08 crore beneficiaries. The graph thus, should have looked like this. One explanation for the BJP showing an increase in the graph could be the cumulative growth in the number of beneficiaries and loans sanctioned each year. But since the data is shown on a yearly basis, it’s irrelevant to show a cumulative increase. The bar for the year 2018-2019 should indicate a decline and not an increase.

Diksha Dutta,"She is ten years old. The men of the family are sitting at the dining table and are being served by the women. She helps her mother and aunts, and thinks she ought to eat later with the other women in solidarity. She does eat later and maybe the best chicken leg piece is not on her plate now. Cut to 25 years later. She worked her way up the corporate ladder and ended up being at the same table as powerful men at boardroom meetings. And yet, she is apologetic – for having the same power as they enjoy. She thinks twice before speaking her mind, and claiming equal rights. Also, she wishes there were more women around her. Is the social conditioning of women the reason why Corporate India is silent on #MeToo? No voices from senior corporate leadership are being heard on the #MeToo movement and no big names have been flashed. As many as 70 percent of women said they did not report sexual harassment by superiors because they feared the repercussions, according to a survey conducted by the Indian Bar Association in 2017. It is no surprise then, that women are not speaking about this openly. A friend who had worked in the Indian corporate sector in the past, connected me with three WhatsApp groups of Indian corporate women, for their views on #MeToo. We received only silence in response. The ones who spoke, wanted anonymity, and some of them withdrew their comments later. “The stakes are too high, Diksha – to speak up and to shift a job after having an opinion on a topic like sexual harassment. That's not the case in media or any other industry. Speaking up is encouraged and women have support,” is what we heard. Is this the case globally as well? My former colleague and friend, Amanda Rino, who moved to Berlin from San Francisco tells me, “I am from San Francisco which is very liberal. I had leadership positions and had tattoos and hot-pink hair. Catcalling existed a lot on the street, but I didn’t experience this with colleagues. But I was also the boss, and people didn’t want to mess with me. Now, there was still a problem of ‘boys clubs’... male employees gathering to speak secretly about a female client or to tell a joke they deemed inappropriate for women.” She continued, “I challenged this exclusion for many years, pointing out how it’s a means to disempower women. But I can’t think of one occasion at work that a man said something directly lewd about my appearance or dress. This is just not socially acceptable in the workplace.” In Berlin, where I have spent nearly a whole year, I can tell you that I am yet to meet a woman who shies away from speaking about women’s issues, or sharing personal experiences openly. But let’s forget the West. Most women have binding work contracts and have to go through the legal framework to make any comments outside the company. What’s worse, they are often not aware of their rights and how to go about handling a case of sexual harassment.   of 2013 holds Indian workplaces liable for sexual harassment and prescribes a system for investigating and redressing complaints. The E&Y report says that 69 percent of the respondents, in their sexual harassment survey, had constituted ICCs in their organisations after the enactment of the Act. However, 18 percent of respondents had not done so, despite there being a lapse of over a year since the notification of the Act, 13 percent were still in the process of setting them up. Non-compliance among Indian companies was higher compared to the average – 36 percent had not constituted ICCs or were in the process of forming one. MNCs were marginally better, standing at 25 percent. “Many of us took years to recognise what constitutes abuse. Recognising, knowing, understanding harassment, especially in situations where one has a close relationship – work, family, etc, is difficult. These things are not talked about and it's something most of us pick up along the way and form our own worldview.” Nousheen Khan, a Kerala-based HR professional commented on a recent   I wrote on sexual harassment in the corporate sector saying, “Fear of being labelled as a troublemaker and loss of reputation, are the biggest reasons why sexual harassment is not reported. Sexually-coloured remarks, jokes are so rampant in our society that they may even fail to evoke any outrage among many colleagues, both men and women. What is frightening is that by normalising it, we are making it legitimate or acceptable. Merril Diniz from the Sheroes team makes a valid case in point, “Casual sexism reflects a deep-rooted societal mindset where both men and women devalue themselves and each other. Please don't compare instances of ‘casual sexism’ with assault and harassment. I disagree. These are all varying degrees of the same problem – of power, disrespect and devaluation of our humanity.” The line between gender discrimination and sexual harassment is sometimes blurred, making it imperative to have clear definitions. Of course, the ideal situation is to have workplaces and homes where gender equality is a given and sexual harassment, for both men and women, is abolished. But among the issues cropping up at the same time is that of ‘which gender issues fall under the aegis of #MeToo’. Having said that, it is tempting to club many burning gender agendas under a movement that has finally taken off. Therefore the onus of not weakening or diluting the movement, by focusing only on those gender battles that specifically involve sexual harassment, is on us. This is a serious movement, and while corporates need to educate their employees on what sexual harassment means, they also need to come out with a voice in this movement. Men and women leaders in the corporate sector, please speak up and say what you feel about this courageous movement in India. It is about time women shared the table with men – at home and in the workplace – without shame or guilt. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Kabir Taneja,"Forty-eight hours before Afghanistan heads into historic parliamentary elections, Kandahar’s police chief General Abdul Raziq along with his intelligence chief was shot and killed, reportedly by his own bodyguard(s) as they turned their weapons on him and others, including American soldiers. The Taliban claimed the attack, forcing Kabul to postpone polling in Kandahar province, despite Afghans defying Taliban threats to come out and vote in healthy numbers. “The Afghan elections are the success of its forces, people and the government”, president of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani said a few hours before the country went to polls, and an hour before the killing of Gen Raziq. The long-awaited parliamentary elections in Afghanistan come at a time when the future course for the country’s political structure remains lucid, at best. The elections are a precursor to next year’s presidential elections, and the following months could see a political wake for Kabul, which under the leadership of President Ashraf Ghani, is struggling on multiple fronts on coming up with a globally accepted resolution to the question of the Taliban, who after 17 years of war with the United States, still hold strong positions across the country. According to research by the Afghanistan Institute for Strategic Studies (AISS) on the experience of parliamentary elections in Afghanistan, the outcomes have been problematic on many accounts, with big disconnects between agendas of the politicians and information available with the electorate on what they’re voting for. Despite the ravages of war, advances of the Taliban and a depleting general security situation in the country, Ghani’s presidency has some light to show for, with these elections, the first such since 2002, the steady movements to strengthen democracy is good news for both the US and Kabul’s regional allies, particularly New Delhi. However, arguably the challenges for Afghanistan’s politics today far outpace the strides Kabul has made to strengthen democratic processes. The Afghan war, now 17 years old, is heading nowhere, is rudderless, and by all indications, endless. The effort to ‘destroy’ the Taliban has been a spectacular failure, with reports from the US government’s leading oversight authority on the country, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) over the past two years highlighting the steady increase in the Afghan Taliban’s influence in large swathes of territory now semi-governed by Kabul. Despite the advancement of democratic processes, the situation remains fragile, and still largely dependent on American and NATO commitments to the country. This situation has become a point of contention, debate and disruption in Washington DC with varying opinions on what future course American policy should take to end a 17-year-old conflict, which has cost more than 2,500 American lives and the American taxpayer upwards of $1 trillion. While many within the US establishment realise the catastrophes that await the international security apparatus in case of a sudden, unplanned and hurried exit from the conflict, the urgency to find an ‘out’ strategy across the board is palpable. This, despite a renewed air campaign in Afghanistan over the past few months to counter the new threat posed by ISKP, a group manned by former Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan fighters and smaller Pahstun warlords, with reports of Pakistani intelligence also playing a role within its ranks. Washington is now also coming to terms on the other alternatives when it comes to deciding on the future of Afghanistan, and there are enough hints that at least the administration of president Donald Trump is open to the idea of the Taliban’s political in the processes of Afghan democracy. This has led to the US being open to talks on Afghanistan led by Russia, which include regional heavyweights such as China, India and Pakistan. In a recent interview, former top US diplomat on Afghanistan Laurel Miller said that any American long-term achievement in the stability of Afghanistan cannot ignore the interests of countries that are currently in talks with Russia on Afghanistan, and that objections raised by these regional states cannot be discounted if peace is to be achieved. While this highlights the disparities in thinking within the American dash for a permanent Afghan resolution, reports of secret Russian interactions with the Taliban, possibly leaked by the US intelligence apparatus to highlight Moscow’s attempts to undermine hard-earned American progress in the war, highlights the murky foreign interests of various interest groups and states over the future of Afghan politics. With corruption having been rampant in the run-up to these polls, Pakistan would have in all likeliness played its cards to make sure none of its interests, which include the Taliban itself – a group mothered by both Pakistan and the US to fight erstwhile Soviet Union in the 1990s. Pakistan’s army headquarters-cum-de-facto-capital Rawalpindi would have taken this opportunity to try and cement its hyper-local influence to both counter India, which has more pull in Kabul, and the US, which needs Pakistan to aid its 18th year of war. Amidst this smorgasbord of diplomatic maneuvering, New Delhi finds itself in its own predicaments – whether to support multilateral talks with the Afghanistan and go against its policy of not negotiating with terrorist groups, or face potential exclusion from a finale political process. Nonetheless, these polls and continuous work towards the democratisation of a country plagued by wars for much of its modern history should be seen as a beacon of hope, despite the security situation in Afghanistan raising more questions than answers every passing day.

Smitha TK,"‘Break the rules,’ reads the bio of Rehana Fathima Pyarijaan Sulaimaan. Now she is under fire for trying to exercise her right under the law. She became one of the first women who almost made it to the top at Sabarimala temple. The journey may not have been completed but she feels this is a success after all for hundreds of women out there. Many at the temple premises and on social media have vehemently opposed her journey. They feel she has upset age-old traditions and this is just provocation and not devotion. spoke to Rehana Fathima to find out what she has to say about the anti-Rehana wave and why she made this journey to Sabarimala. When did you decide you wanted to go to Sabarimala? I have always wanted to go but I was waiting for the court order. When the Supreme Court verdict came I thought it was apt to go at this time.  Did you follow the  when you went to Sabarimala? We should follow brahmacharya, that is going on the path of God. We should not  have relations with men, walk without slippers, wear   carry an and only then can you go up the 18 steps.  While you were walking to the temple in protective gear, when did the trouble begin? We knew we were going to meet a lot of opposition. So we treaded every step very carefully and the police and we were on alert. After an hour of climbing, the other woman who was trekking along with me, Kavitha, was attacked directly because she was in the front. That’s why the police gave us vests and helmets for protection. We were just about to enter the temple. You didn’t complete this journey but would you call it a successful one? Yes. I won’t say I didn’t complete journey. We climbed the hill and that was a big step. We were going to enter the temple and climb the 18 steps.  But at the entrance they had made little kids stand guard and told us to stamp on them and walk into the temple. We are not bad people to hurt children and enter a temple. We had the support of the police but we were told by the temple authorities that they will shut down the temple if we enter. Then how would we go?  We realised that the more time we waited outside the temple, more we were troubling the children.  Many people who objected  on social media are discriminating you for being a Muslim. What do you have to say? The people had a fixed agenda that they were not going to allow women into the temple. They were just finding reasons to justify that. For me, they had a strong reason that I was Muslim. The temple is usually welcome to all religions but they were very clear they were not going to allow women so they discriminated me for being Muslim. Many are saying you are an activist and not a devotee. How do you respond? I have never declared I am an activist. I voice my opinions for any social issues and as a human being and a woman, I think we have to react. I feel there are times we have to step up and talk.  Do you check if all the men who come there are true devotees? Do you know what all men do before coming to Sabarimala? But because they are fixated on not allowing women they raised these arguments. Is there any method to find if a person is a devotee or not? Every person’s way of devotion is different. How do you measure devotion?  This is not the real problem. The issue is I am a woman. If it is the case of devotion, then why did they deny entry for the women devotees who came before me? There is this allegation doing the rounds on social media that you carried sanitary napkins in your  . Please clarify. This was a way to misguide people. In fact, I left my   with the police when I left. Usually, a person who goes with the  should be able to complete the journey. When this allegation surfaced, the police checked my irumudikettu and my partner’s and even took photos of it. People were using my Muslim name and tactics like spreading the idea that I was there to create trouble, that I carried sanitary napkins – all to misguide people. When people are already questioning if I am a devotee or not, planting this idea that I was a lady who had gone there to only create trouble, would aggravate them. So no one would anyway believe what I say.  I even had a paper where I had scribbled down a list of items I needed for the   which I handed over to the police. Are your children safe? Your house was attacked and you said you have been receiving a number of threats. My partner also came with me to Sabarimala. The previous night I had left my children at my friend’s place. We brought our kids back the evening we returned. We have police protection even now. This is not the first time you are making a bold statement. Earlier when a male professor compared women’s breasts to watermelons and advised girls to cover themselves since they attract men, you retorted by posting a photo that became controversial. You were also part of the ‘Kiss of Love’ campaign against moral policing in 2014. You have been very vocal about what you believe in. In every religion, there are attempts made to quiet the women and keep them in cages. Men and women are equal. And when there are a few situations when this equality is disturbed, someone needs to stand up and speak. Saying, yes we also want to go there, we also want to do that. We all deserve the same opportunities in life.  Many women have come forward and spoken up, that’s why today there is so much visibility and empowerment for women. This has been a long struggle. That is the reason women have freedom to an extent today.  I have done whatever I can. I am a working mother of two and I have done whatever I can in my capacity. If everyone attempts to do the same for this society, then it will be better.  Many are sharing your bold pictures from Instagram and accusing you of being a Muslim woman doing this for publicity. What do you want to tell them? If I wanted to pull off a publicity stunt, I would’ve called a press conference and announced that I was going to make this journey. I didn’t want it but because of all that was happening I was forced to have police protection. In fact, media knew about me climbing the hill only after I was halfway up the hill. Until then the media only knew it was some woman. It is because of my name that it caught their attention.  People who know me will know why I did this. This was not for publicity or a protest. The Supreme Court gave us the support that even women can go here and I, like many other strong-willed women, only exercised their right. Are there any cases filed against you? I have heard from local channels that someone of Pathanamthitta has filed a complaint against me. But there are complaints filed against all the women who have gone to Sabarimala. The police came to us to record our statements regarding a few people who attacked our house. What do you want to tell women? We are not disobeying the law but just doing something legal.

The Quint,"The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) and the World Editors Forum on Friday, 19 October, condemned what it called was ""the growing culture of impunity for crimes against journalists"" in the wake of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier in October. In its  , the organisation said: The organisation also called for Turkey to furnish proof showing involvement of the Saudi State in the killing and asserted that international pressure should be stepped up so as to hold the Saudi monarchy accountable. In a major development in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia recently confirmed that he was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. The country's public prosecutor said that preliminary investigations showed an ""altercation"" and ""fistfight"" led to Khashoggi's death shortly after he arrived at the consulate.

Anubhav Mishra," Mohd Irshad Alam   Union Home Minister and one of the most senior MPs of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Rajnath Singh, ‘adopted’ Beti village of Uttar Pradesh under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) in 2014. The village is located 35 kms from state capital Lucknow and has a population of 5,000. This will be the ninth village in  ’s series, named ‘Our MP’s Villages: Achhe Din?’ We earlier reported on  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  ’s villages. The objective of SAGY was that MPs cater to the needs of their adopted villages and work towards their holistic development. Some of the goals that the MPs were to achieve under SAGY are:  investigates how many of these objectives were achieved. When you arrive in Beti, you will see ‘  roads’ meandering through the village. The lanes in the village are mostly RCC (reinforced cement concrete) roads or interlocked brick roads. Most of these roads have been constructed. The village already had a primary school. Since Rajnath adopted the village, the school building was repaired and new toilets were built for the students. A higher secondary school was also constructed. However, a girls’ college was also promised to the village, but has not been established yet. The village has complete electrification and village head Vikas Sahu claims that every house has been provided with an electricity connection. However, the villagers complain that they only get power for 20 hours a day, and face load shedding or power outages for at least four hours daily. Health facilities have been one of the most significant problems faced by the people of Beti. The locals complain that if someone falls ill and needs to be hospitalised, the nearest hospital is 35 kms away in Lucknow. Locals also complain that a veterinary hospital was promised but has not been built yet. Despite the grand advertisement of the Swachh Bharat Campaign by Modi government, locals are unhappy with the state of cleanliness in their village. The village has a bank and an ATM. The village head claims that the village has made unexpected strides in development since it was adopted by Rajnath Singh. Beti witnessed quite a bit of work and development since it was ‘adopted’ by Rajnath Singh, but the village is still a long way from being ‘adarsh’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"With the price of diesel being higher than that of petrol for the last three days, a rather odd situation has risen in Odisha. On Monday, 22 October, the price of diesel in state capital Bhubaneswar was at Rs 80.40 per litre, higher than the price of petrol which was at Rs 80.27 per litre. This defies the usual trend across the country of petrol being priced higher than diesel, since the latter   lower taxes, lower dealer commissions and lower base price. Responding to this situation, Utkal Petroleum Dealers Association general secretary Sanjay Lath said this was the first time the price of diesel had surpassed that of petrol in Odisha, reported PTI. Lath said while other states have different VAT rates for petrol and diesel (with the rate being lower for diesel), Odisha charges a uniform 26 percent VAT on both. He claimed there has been a decline in the sale of diesel in Odisha because of its high price. Another aspect to be factored in while seeing the fuel price dynamics in Odisha is the rise in the base price for diesel – which is charged by oil companies from dealers excluding the tax – by approximately Rs 5,  . This higher base price has nullified the impact of lower dealer commissions and lower excise duty charged for diesel. With diesel becoming costlier than petrol in Odisha, the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and opposition Congress on Sunday blamed the ""faulty"" policy of the central government for the rise in price of diesel, reported PTI. Behera feared that the prices of essential commodities will also go up because of the increase in diesel price. Senior Congress leader Arya Gyanendra reportedly said, ""There is an inefficient government at the Centre which failed to regulate fuel price, particularly diesel..."" Meanwhile, BJP state general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan responding by saying, ""Finance minister (Behera) should be judicious while making a statement on an important issue. Everybody in the country knows the reason behind the rise in the prices of fuel. While 13 states have reduced VAT on the fuel, the Odisha government is yet take a decision in this regard."" Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is from Odisha, on Sunday asked the state government to reduce the rate of VAT to give relief to people. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"In Kerala, tempers are running high, emotions are fragile, slogans of ‘Swamiye Ayyappo’ are echoing and human chains of men and women are being formed. The Sabarimala temple has opened its gates for the first time for women after the Supreme Court issued an order. But the people of Kerala are not willing to accept the order. Undeterred by the mounting protests, two women – an activist Rehana Fathima and Hyderabad journalist Kavitha Jakkal – dressed in complete bullet-proof vests and helmets, walked towards the temple amidst heavy police force on Friday, 19 October. Just 500 metres away from the shrine, the fence of protesters grew stronger and the police advised the two women to return. There has been a lot of outrage against activist Rehana Fathima. Fathima is a telecom   and has acted in an art film  . The makers have claimed that this is the first movie of its kind to be made in India. The film is about intersexuality. The posters of   carried the tagline: ‘I am intersex. I have a penis and vagina by birth. I want to live.’ The 31-year-old government employee was born in an orthodox Muslim family, reported  . Her partner is producer Manoj K Sreedhar and they have two children. She said she became disillusioned with religion after her father’s death and has since been quite vocal in projecting her opinions. ""Outside BSNL premises, Ms Fathima alone shall be fully responsible for her actions, in her own personal capacity, outside normal business hours,"" said the company, dissociating itself from the row, to  . Fathima had posted a picture of herself wearing the traditional Sabarimala black attire and   on Facebook with the caption, ‘Philosophy’. The picture earned the wrath of several devotees and the anger was quite evident in the scores of protesters gathered at the temple entrance, and on social media. Early Friday morning, two unidentified men on bikes attacked Fathima's house in Kochi. Window panes were shattered, a gas cylinder and flower pots were thrown on the road. When Fathima addressed the press while returning from the temple, she said, “My apartment has been ransacked. I don’t know where my children are. My life is under threat. The police have assured complete security.” Fathima’s name has cropped up in a number of controversies in the past. Earlier, in March 2018, a male professor compared women’s breasts to watermelons and advised girls to cover themselves since they attract men. Fathima retorted to this by posting a topless photo holding watermelons. The photo received both support and backlash from people, and Facebook took it down after the number of trolls and abusive comments piled up. She was part of the ‘Kiss of Love’ campaign against moral policing in 2014. Her partner, filmmaker Manoj K Sreedhar, had shared a clip of the kiss on Facebook, reported  . Fathima was also one of the first women to participate in the Thrissur   in 2016. It is a traditional dance form performed by men dressed like tigers during the festival of Onam in Kerala. She had then told Manorama she had always wanted to “perform in a space dominated by men,” the report by   added. Hindu outfits and devotees in Kerala are protesting against Fathima for trying to defy the tradition in Sabarimala temple. Devaswom Minister Kadakampalli Surendran told the Director General of Police that the temple was not a place for activism. ""The government's interest is to protect the interests of the devotees. Sabarimala is not a place for you to prove the power of your activism. I plead to all activists to not misuse the judgment like this. If true devotees come, the government is committed to take them to the sannidhanam. The government is not responsible for providing security to activists,"" he said. When journalists asked Fathima if she was a true devotee, she retorted saying, Many have taken to social media to express their anger saying this is provocation, just an attempt at publicity and not devotion.

Jehangir Ali ,"With the results of the much-hyped municipal elections out in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), a joke has been doing the rounds on social media. It goes like this: “In Ward Number 3 of Srinagar, two candidates were in the electoral fray. Only three votes out of 30,000 were polled. Guess which candidate divorced his wife?” The joke aptly sums up how the democratic process has been reduced to a travesty in the Kashmir Valley under an unprecedented security cover. A little over four percent of possible votes were polled in Kashmir Valley in the four-phase elections, the results of which were declared on Saturday, 20 October. Of 624 seats spanning 40 municipal bodies in ten districts of the Valley, polling was held in only 208 seats. A total of 416 seats did not require voting, either because only one candidate was in fray or there was no candidate (over 30 percent of the wards received no nomination forms). For the first time, the two main regional parties – the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party – boycotted an election in Kashmir. For the first time, free insurance cover and other perks were offered to aspiring candidates who were locked up in hotels and government accommodations. It was also the first time that the identity of those filing nomination forms was kept a secret till the results were declared. This level of secrecy was not invoked even at the peak of insurgency! The electoral battles also have been ludicrously close. Sample this: in SK Colony Ward of south Kashmir’s Anantnag town, out of 2,400-odd votes, only   were polled; four votes in favour of a BJP candidate and ten votes for a Congress candidate who was declared a ‘winner’. In a central Kashmir town, at least three candidates from the same family have been elected unopposed to the municipal committee. In the meanwhile in Baramulla, a ‘youth leader’,  Touseef Raina, and his brother lost the battle for ‘change’ – while their mother won. Some candidates knew of their fate in advance, because of dismal voting, “I already knew I was going to win. Nine votes were polled in my ward out of which eight were in my favour,” Bashir Mir, who won from Bagh-e-Mehtab Ward on BJP ticket, told  . Mir has straddled the mainstream political spectrum in Kashmir Valley for the last two decades and hopes to get elected to the state legislative assembly one day. “Boycotting elections is not the answer. It doesn’t matter if you win by one vote or thousands. Victory is victory,” he said. On paper, the big winners in the elections were the independents. In the all-important 74 wards of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, for example, the independent candidates walked away with a clear majority of 49 wards. Most of the independents are seen to be backed by the Sajad Lone-led Peoples Conference (PC) and a rebel PDP leader who was a minister in the PDP-BJP coalition government. The BJP contested 72 wards in Srinagar but won only four, marking its debut victory in an election in the Kashmir Valley, while the Congress, contesting in 46 wards, won just 15. Junaid Mattu, who is touted to become the Mayor of Srinagar, resigned from the National Conference to contest as an ‘independent’ candidate. Sajad Lone had maintained his silence Mattu, who was formerly with the People’s Conference, and then broke the news of Junaid’s ‘ghar-wapsi’ on Twitter: Of the 15 wards in Ganderbal, two were won by the BJP and the Congress while 13 were bagged by independents. In Handwara, of the seven wards, six went uncontested. All the seven winning candidates are independents backed by PC. Almost all the independents have overt and covert associations with the political mainstream. The BJP has good reason to feel happy about these elections in Kashmir. Not only has it scored a debut century in Muslim-majority Kashmir by winning 100 wards, the party has visibly strengthened its grip in the Hindu-majority Jammu region, emerging as the single largest party with 212 wards despite reportedly facing infighting and desertions. Ram Madhav, the BJP’s general secretary and point-man in Kashmir, tweeted triumphantly: But the victory has come at a huge cost. The dismal voter turnout in Kashmir Valley that remained confined to single digits, has cast a dark shadow on the upcoming Panchayat elections and the Lok Sabha elections next year. “In absence of a decent voter turnout, the relevance of elections to the prevailing political discourse on the Kashmir conflict will certainly get affected. If people don’t vote in elections, how are you going to justify their credibility?” Noor A Baba, a political scientist and Dean of Social Science at the Central University of Kashmir, said. “Years of investment in peace have been thrown to the wind because of the aggressive policy of the central government. With such dismal voter turnout, the argument that elections in J&K are ‘free and fair’ will be difficult to buy” he added. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

PTI,"More than 130 Afghans were killed or wounded in poll-related violence on Saturday, 20 October, officials said, as the legislative election turned chaotic with hundreds of polling centres failing to open and voters queuing for hours. Most of the casualties were in Kabul, where at least four people were killed and 78 wounded in multiple explosions, acting health ministry spokesman Mohibullah Zeer told AFP, after the Taliban warned voters to boycott the ballot ""to protect their lives"". Election organisers, who have been skewered over their shambolic preparations for the long-delayed ballot, said they would extend voting until Sunday for 360 polling centres after hiccups with voter registration lists and biometric verification devices caused lengthy delays. Violence also disrupted voting. In the northern city of Kunduz, three people died and 39 were wounded, hospital director Marzia Yaftali told AFP, after more than 20 rockets rained down on the provincial capital. An Independent Election Commission (IEC) employee was killed and seven others were missing after the Taliban attacked a polling centre several kilometres from Kunduz city, destroying ballot boxes, provincial IEC director Mohammad Rasoul Omar said. Eight explosions were recorded in the eastern province of Nangarhar, with two people killed and five wounded, the provincial governor's spokesman said. Most polling sites opened late after teachers employed to handle the voting process failed to show up on time, said the IEC, which promised to extend voting by four hours. University student Mohammad Alem said he felt ""frustrated"" after spending more than three hours trying to vote in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, only to discover his name was not on the registration list. ""There also were some problems with the biometric devices because they were already running out of charge,"" he said. After waiting four hours at a polling centre, Tabish Forugh tweeted he had not seen ""even remotely similar... chaos"" at previous elections. Almost nine million people registered to vote in the parliamentary election, which is more than three years late. But attacks across the country on Saturday are likely to deter many from turning up at the nearly 5,000 polling centres. Hundreds of people were killed or wounded in the months leading up to the poll. The killing of a powerful police chief in the southern province of Kandahar on Thursday further eroded confidence in the ability of security forces to protect voters. Voting in Kandahar has been delayed by a week following the attack. Photos posted on social media showed scores of men and women clutching their identification documents lining up outside voting centres amid a heavy security presence. A woman dressed in a burqa leaving a polling centre in Mazar-i-Sharif told AFP she had been worried about ""security incidents"", but decided to vote anyway. ""We have to defy the violence,"" Hafiza, 57, said. ""In previous years we were not happy with the elections, our votes were sold out."" The Taliban issued several warnings in the days leading up to the poll, calling on candidates to withdraw from the race and for voters to stay home. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which has spearheaded international efforts to keep Afghan organisers on track, on Friday called on voters to ""exercise their constitutional right to vote"". The poll is seen as a crucial test for next year's presidential election and an important milestone ahead of a UN meeting in Geneva in November where Afghanistan is under pressure to show progress on ""democratic processes"". Preliminary results will be released on 10 November but there are concerns they could be thrown into turmoil if the biometric verification devices are broken, lost or destroyed. Votes cast without the controversial machines will not be counted, the IEC has said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Vikram Venkateswaran,"In separate statements over the past few days, both Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan have reacted to the MeToo movement in Tamil Nadu and on the Sabarimala issue. Here’s what they had to say, in a decidedly cat-on-the-wall manner. At an impromptu presser outside the Chennai airport on Saturday, 20 October, a group of Tamil language reporters asked actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth about the MeToo movement. The question was, “Do you support the movement?” When asked to respond to allegations of sexual misconduct, abuse and intimidation against lyricist Vairamuthu, he had this to say: On 12 October, Kamal Haasan was accosted by a group of journalists before entering an event, and asked about the MeToo movement. He had this to say: What the story of Kannagi has to do with women coming out with stories of sexual misconduct and assault, one will never know. But when asked about allegations against Vairamuthu, Kamal Haasan was equally vague. Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the rest of the country is sharply divided on the issue of the entry of women into the Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala. Some are in unequivocal support of the Supreme Court’s verdict that women should be allowed to enter, regardless of age. However, a majority of people are against the verdict and have taken to the streets to show their resistance to the verdict. Kamal Haasan, a self-proclaimed atheist had this to say on the issue: For someone with a facile pen when it comes to Twitter, and on everything under the sun, Kamal Haasan’s (non-)statement on the Sabarimala issue can only be seen as defensive, safe play. Rajinikanth, however, said it’s better not to interfere in matters of faith. When asked again if he meant he was not in support of the Supreme Court ruling, he said: So is he in favour of the SC ruling or against it? Is he all for women’s rights or no? Rajinikanth also mentioned that while 90 percent of the work toward launching his political party is already done, he will not be launching it this 12 December, as thought earlier.

Revati Laul,"  I don’t come from a convention or tradition-bound family. At the same time, my parents weren’t radical either. Hanging between the secular and the religious, we were a family that didn’t go to temples, didn’t insist on prayer and didn’t object to it either. This left a wide-open space for me to grow up questioning everything. Why do we light  and then why not? Who is Raavan and equally, who is Ram? Which is demon, which, God? To be despondent and let our hearts sink, or create a new-old tradition. Go back to some new Gods in a time-tested way. For this festival of dissent, I curate first, a brass tap. This existed in the second bathroom in our home when I was growing up. I banged into it accidentally whilst having a bath one cold wintry Delhi morning. Or rather my crotch banged into the tap. I was twelve. The cold metal sent a shock down my body and made me quiver with delight. I bent over the tap again. I didn’t know the word for it, but I was masturbating. Other objects that had a smooth curved back – like my old fountain pen or the eye liner pencil did time as well, in the absence of properly designed objects for the purpose. This was the mid-1980s and the nuns in the Catholic school I went to, said masturbation is a sin. I told nobody what I was doing. But it felt great. Here’s to self-help and pleasure. From the Kama Sutra to the tap-sutra, know thy self. They had no tap-lessons, so they didn’t know their pleasure spots. They laid back and let men do their thing but weren’t on any tidal waves of joy because they weren’t playing an active part. We toss around the word ‘agency’ – women must have agency over their choices but we don’t really explain to young children how you acquire it. Or that pleasuring themselves is the most basic form of self-love and the most natural. The next object for this festival is a particular Madonna video, released in July 1985, when I was twelve. Exhibit A from the video – Madonna’s black lace top – entirely see through and the black bra beneath. Bold, femme and owning her sexuality entirely. Exhibit B – the lyrics. “Get into the groove boy you’ve got to prove your love to me.” Madonna is the goddess and men have to prove their worthiness, coolness, sexiness to be in her frame at all. Goddesses are for aspiration. We look up to them and deify them so we can be like them, emulate, celebrate all that they represent. O Madonna, here’s to getting into your groove! But it’s a bit uncool I know to have one’s head stuck in the 1980s and propitiate the white person’s pop-culture; even though Madonna transcends that in the time she said and wore what she did. So the next object is from terra firma. Many of the depictions, particularly when a woman is being loved by multiple partners, is that the faces in these depictions have little or no expression. It is routine, every day and to my mind completely carnal. You are not distracted by facial expressions of ecstasy or love, your attention is completely and plainly on the sex. Also, orgies and multiple partners are the aspiration, the temple of all fantasy. Love and desire, being sated is vital. It is soul food. It is the essence of everything. And there is no better keeper of the tradition of dissidence, lust, desire and everything willful, than Ismat Chughtai’s writings. The final and most special exhibit for the festival. Writing in the 1930s and 40s about the desire of the housemaid Laajo for instance. Laajo was an orphan child and she grew up with no rules. So she could not be tamed. Mirza fell in love and in lust with her and tried to tame her, turn her into ‘The Wife’ (the title of the story) but failed. “But Laajo couldn’t understand why it was necessary to get married,” Ismat wrote. “The moment she became his wife, Mirza placed a restriction on lehengas and had pyjamas with narrow legs made for her… Now Kaneez Fatima (Laajo’s married name) was accustomed to free space between her legs, two pyjama legs were a nuisance. Again and again she would pull at this hindrance, and the first chance she got, she tore off the pyjamas and was slipping the lehenga over her head when Mirza walked through the door.” Laajo on the other hand, feels free. Unfettered. And continues her lustful desire-filled relationship with Mirza once the bondage has been done away with. The ‘non-wife’ could be full of love once again. Here’s to non- . To calling out our demons. And finding the inner-tap to ourselves as the outer world implodes around us.  ‘ ’,  (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, 20 October, emerged as a clear winner in the Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) elections with 43 seats in its kitty, bettering its previous strength of 25 in the 75-member body.  The Congress suffered a big loss in the election, winning only 14 seats against its 26 in the 2005 civic polls, election officials said. Then it was ruling Jammu and Kashmir in coalition with the PDP. The BJP won 43 seats in the JMC elections, the officials said. The independent candidates also presented a good show, winning a total of 18 seats in the JMC. In the rest of the 446 wards spread across Jammu region covering a total of 36 municipal committees and councils, the BJP had an edge over its rivals in 15 bodies followed by Independents in 12 and the Congress in five, they said. The BJP won a total of 169 seats in these bodies followed by independents at 167 and the Congress at 96, the officials said. They attributed the emergence of independents as a strong force in view of the absence of the NC and the PDP, the key regional parties.  The election in a ward in Ramban was countermanded due to the death of a BJP candidate who suffered a heart attack on the day of polling in the second phase on 10 October.  The election in the 521 municipal wards in the 10 districts of Jammu was held in the first three phases of the elections in the state, which concluded on 16 October, recording a high voter turnout of 68.4 percent among the over 6.44 lakh electorate. Thirteen candidates were elected to different municipal wards unopposed, leaving a total of 2,137 candidates in the fray. The JMC along with seven municipal committees of Jammu went to polls in the first phase on 8 October, registering a turnout of 63.8 percent.  The counting of votes in the winter capital started at a government polytechnic institute at 9 am. As the results started pouring in, BJP leaders and activists came out to celebrate the party's victory. Raina said it was the victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision and efforts to take the country to new heights and the hard work and dedication of party leaders and workers.  The Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP) failed to open its account in the majority of the wards, including the JMC. Party chairman and former minister Harsh Dev Singh alleged rigging and claimed, ""It is not the BJP but electronic voting machine (EVM) which won the election for the party."" ""EVMs should be replaced with ballot boxes to enure free and fair polls,"" he said.  Deepak Gupta, the brother of senior BJP leader Kavinder Gupta, was among the prominent candidates who lost the elections. However, Rajinder Singh alias Bubby, the brother of senior BJP leader Choudhary Lal Singh, and his wife Vandina Andotra won as independents from Kathua municipal council.  Bubby was in the centre of a controversy in May when a video of him went viral on social media in which he was purportedly abusing former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti during a 'Dogra Swabhiman rally. The rally was led by the former minister in support of a demand for a CBI probe into the Kathua rape and murder case. An FIR was registered against Bubby who was later arrested from Rajasthan's Udaipur in June after evading arrest for nearly a month.  In the seven municipal committees of Jammu, the BJP won Akhnoor with 11 seats, while two seats went to Congress. In Bishnah, the BJP won six seats against seven by Independents. In Arnia, the BJP won seven seats, independents five and Congress one, in R S Pura BJP won nine, Independents three and Congress one, in Ghmanhansan won BJP two, Congress-two, in Khour won BJP nine and Congress four and in Jourian BJP won two, Congress four and independent one, the officials said.

The feedback, the report added, is being gathered, apart from traditional channels, through PM Narendra Modi’s Namo app. Rajasthan’s state assembly has 200 seats. The BJP had swept the last elections of 2013 with 160 seats while the Congress managed only 25. “There is growing dissent against senior ministers such as home minister Gulab Chand Kataria, public health engineering department minister Surendra Goyal, public works department minister Yunus Khan and Devasthan minister Raj Kumar Rinwa. There are indications that around six cabinet ministers will get the axe,” a senior BJP leader, who is part of the party’s election management committee, was quoted as saying by  , on condition of anonymity. Similarly, in 2013, the ruling Congress had fielded 105 repeat candidates. A staggering 91 candidates were voted out. With elections scheduled for 7 December, it would be a challenge for the Congress party to keep the flock together and maintain the momentum, whereas the BJP election machinery will try its best to find a chink in the Congress’s armour.

Nishtha Gautam,"How much #MeToo is too much #MeToo? While the naysayers are going all out and calling the #MeToo movement everything from “ ” to “political conspiracy”, even some allies are beginning to feel that the movement has been getting undue media attention. Just two weeks of collective catharsis, and already resentment is beginning to brew for ignoring other, more important, issues of national interest. The simple reason is, #MeToo is about more than a half a billion citizens of this country. It is also far bigger than what a single ministry, the one headed by Maneka Gandhi, is equipped to deal with. It is no secret that women’s labour force participation in India is seeing an alarming decline. From 34.1 percent in 1999-00 to 27.2 percent in 2011-12, and from 26.8 percent in 2008 to 24.7 percent in 2017, as per the  , the workforce participation rates tell a dismal story. What does not get highlighted often is the fact that women are not opposed to the idea of being gainfully employed within the safety of their homes. The findings of an ILO trends  for India (2014) stated the following: It is not difficult to infer that women want to work as long as they are assured of a safe and enabling environment. For most women, home is that space, because they have been forced indoors due to the predatory behaviour of men out on the streets, in schools, at colleges, and at workplaces. Women’s participation in the labour force is not merely a fruit of industrialisation begotten modernity. The Harappan ‘Dancing Girl’ is a woman at work. The charge that #MeToo is a concern only for the urban, privileged women is a red herring. The illustrated manuscripts from the Malwa Sultanate period (1392–1562), for example, showed women engaged in a variety of activities ranging from field-work to textile industry. Illustrations from  -  can be referred for the same. Kautilya’s seminal text talks about how the State employed women in the textile industry. Women’s traditional work in textiles clearly surpassed family needs. As per 14th century accounts of Abdul Malik Isami — a historian in the Bahmani sultanate — women of   castes used to spin. How this economic activity became a domain of men, is not very clear. Various historical and literary accounts suggest that women were also employed in professions like midwifery and inn-keeping, in addition to the usual suspects such as entertainment and acrobatics. Women’s marginalisation in the workforce over centuries would make for an interesting read, but that’s for another time. What is relevant now is the fact that women do not feel safe at their workplaces, ergo #MeToo. Sexual harassment at the workplace is one of the crudest forms of gender discrimination. Women are often harassed to establish male dominance at the workplace. To put them in their place. The Hooter (strip-club) lunch meetings in the US and the cruise parties or Bangkok work trips in India, are all part of this testosterone-driven work culture where women do not belong. Where men live and breathe entitlement. Where women are forced to take a backseat, or become collaborators. While an India-centric study is still not available,  by Heather McLaughlin, Christopher Uggen and Amy Blackstone, sheds light on the impact of sexual harassment on women workers. It is therefore fair to assume that things aren’t that different in India in this regard. However, because of the rigidity of disciplines in India, industry switchovers may not be that easy, forcing women to call it a day in their careers. Stealing the opportunity to work from women by subjecting them to sexual harassment,   discrimination. This is in violation of the fundamental right to equality that the Constitution of India grants women. Despite mandated by the POSH Act 2013, most companies do not have the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to look into the cases of sexual harassment. Under the POSH, the employer is also supposed to prepare “an annual report with details on the number of cases filed and their disposal and submit the same to the District Officer”. It is difficult to find a company that does the needful. It is even more difficult to find a District Officer that has put a system in place to receive and assess these annual reports. The #MeToo movement is both an outcome and a symbol of these systemic failures. When half of India’s population does not feel safe, it is also an internal security matter. The moment legislators and pontificators label sexual harassment at the workplace as a women’s issue, it is a deliberate act to undermine the gravity of the situation. ‘Trial by media’ is an excess. ‘Silencing by media’ is an abdication of responsibility. While on one hand, the government wants to survey the domestic work of women and make it a part of the economic growth story, is it acceptable to relegate #MeToo to a ‘women’s only’ issue, that in turn is only relevant to a handful of the urban, privileged ones? If more Indian women worked, balancing the workforce, the GDP would rise by 27 percent, as per the latest IMF  . Many men have spoken out in support of their wives, family members, friends, and colleagues. More men are needed to say that it is a matter that concerns all the citizens of this country. While little academic research has happened in India to clearly establish the role of the press, Abigail C Saguy established in her book ‘ that American reporting on the   case hearings, arguably led to stronger sexual harassment laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 allowed harassment and discrimination complainants for the first time the right to a jury trial in federal court along with the right to collect compensatory and punitive damages. Let’s not, therefore, begrudge the column space and airtime #MeToo is hogging. Many more summits need to be scaled: the headlines must stay. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Srishti Tyagi," Abhishek Kumar A New Delhi-based woman journalist was stopped midway by devotees opposing the entry of women of menstrual age into the hill shrine on Friday, 19 October. The journalist accompanied by her male colleague, a foreigner, descended the hills from Marakkoottam area in the face of mounting protests. A case has been registered against devotees who allegedly prevented her trekking and forced her to climb down the hills. The Centre has asked the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to tighten security in view of the continuing protests against the Supreme Court order allowing entry of women of all age groups to Sabarimala temple. In an advisory, the Union Home Ministry also asked the three states to closely monitor the dissemination of various ""adverse"" messages through social media and the Internet services. The advisory said appropriate prohibitory orders be issued and a close watch may be kept on dissemination of ""adverse information"" through social media and internet services, to ensure that no breach of law and order takes place. It also referred to campaigns of certain civil and women's rights activists, Left parties and fronts and pro-Left wing extremism groups in favour of women's entry into the shrine and actively using women to do so.  While opposing groups and activists have threatened that they would not allow entry of women inside the shrine, Hindu outfits plan to organise protest programmes against apex court order, it said.

Actor Tanushree Dutta had lodged an FIR with the Mumbai police earlier last week, alleging harassment by Nana Patekare on the sets of a 2008 movie “Horn Ok Pleassss”. Stating that Dutta had filed her complaint ten years after the incident had happened, Thackeray said that while women could approach the MNS in instance of any oppression, they should not do so “after ten years.” “If anything like #MeToo happens, women can come to MNS. We will teach a lesson to accused. Women must raise the voice when they face oppression, not after 10 years,"" the MNS chief said. According to ANI, Thackeray also alleged that the heightened coverage of the #MeToo movement was being done in a bid to shift focus from issues such as “fuel prices, rupee value and unemployment.” Incidentally, the #MeToo movement spread like wildfire following Dutta’s acknowledgment of the 2008 incident involving Patekar, prompting scores of women to come out with their stories of harassment by men in power.

Aritra Bhattacharya,"Visit any Durga puja pandal on the afternoon of Navami, and you will come across scores of eager ‘devotees’ who are there just for the   (ritual offering made to gods).  The enthusiasm over the delicious  ,   (a gooey mixed vegetable curry) and  — the essentials, according to  -lore — is apparent on social media too, as hundreds post their experiences, selfies even, of enjoying a good meal to their heart’s content. But what of those who revere Mahishasura, and not his slayer, goddess Durga? What do they eat, or offer to Mahishasura during the period of Navratri? There are several such communities spread across the country — from tribal groups in West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to lower caste communities in Karnataka. “There’s one important distinction we must keep in mind in this regard,” says writer and activist Asit Roy, who has lived in and travelled across tribal areas in eastern India, including with the late renowned writer and social activist Mahashweta Devi. The Asura tribals spread across Jharkhand and West Bengal believe that Mahishasura, their ancestor, was killed deceitfully by an “outsider”, ie, goddess Durga. Similarly, the Munda, Oraon and Santhal tribals also revere Mahishasura. They argue that the ‘ ’ story of the ‘ ’, which describes the birth of Durga and her nine-day battle with Mahishasura, ending in the latter’s slaying, is but one version of the myth. Since it was committed to writing in a “sacred text” as opposed to being propagated orally, it has become a truism of sorts. “For many tribal groups, the Durga puja period is one of mourning,” says Roy. “During the days of the puja, men from tribal villages in Bengal and Jharkhand dress up as women and do a ritual dance called  , travelling from place to place. This is part of their traditional practice.” In some parts, a communal meal is part of the mourning. “For instance, in Gumla, Latehar and surrounding districts of Jharkhand and West Bengal, almost every forest village has a symbolic  (place for burial of a deceased’s ashes), where the villagers congregate for a puja on Navami or Diwali,” says Ranchi-based writer and activist Aloka Kujur, who has participated in several such programmes over the last few years. Although the sacrifice (and eating) of buffaloes, signifying the ‘demon king’, during Durga Puja is common in parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal, communities that revere Mahishashur do not slaughter the buffalo. “In some places, a buffalo calf, signifying our ancestor and lovingly referred to as Kaala, is worshipped during this period,” says Kujur. A host of Dalit Bahujan groups spread across states have been focussing on popularising counter-narratives about Mahishashur over the last decade or so through books, pujas and performances. For instance, this year, Mysore witnessed the fifth edition of a programme commemorating Mahishasura as a Buddhist monk and a benevolent king. “Historical records tell us that Mahisha, a Buddhist monk, was deputed by Emperor Asoka to rule over these parts and spread Buddhism. Therefore, the name ‘Mahisha mandala’, which was changed to Mysore in the British period,” says writer and rationalist KS Bhagwan. Bhagwan, also one of the organisers of the programme, says there were no restrictions on food under Mahisha’s reign. “People could eat anything, including beef. Even Brahmins used to eat beef then,” says Bhagwan. The food at the Mahisha commemoration programme, however, comprises “simple vegetarian fare”, like what is offered in most temples in Karnataka during Navratri. The similarity of offerings to Mahisha and his slayer across various parts of the country notwithstanding, such practices only help underscore a point that groups who revere Mahishasura have been making for long: That Mahishasura and other asuras, as much as those who trace their inheritance after them, are not demons, but very much human beings who eat what we all eat.

Pragya Tiwari,"KB Hegdewar founded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925, on the day of Vijay Dashami, with the aim of “organising the Hindu society.” While this fundamental idea remains its guiding principle what it entails has been defined, refined, and revised several times over in the last nine decades. Similarly, while the idea of regular meetings organised to mould the character of participants in accordance with  virtues remains at the heart of daily  , the organisation has also expanded its ambit through its affiliates. These affiliates are working with many different groups, such as labourers, farmers, traders, tribals, Dalits, religious leaders, students, teachers, and in any number of different fields such as, education, history, policy, and of course politics through the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The affiliates enjoy a fair degree of autonomy without losing sight of the core values of the RSS. These core values are the glue that has kept this mammoth and inordinately complex juggernaut together over the years. Every year on Vijaya Dashami, the day the RSS was founded, the Sarsanghchalak, who is the supreme leader of the RSS and its affiliates, gives a speech that provides guidance to the various facets of the organisation on how to set their priorities and agenda for the coming year so that they may work in different ways towards a common aim. In keeping with tradition, this year, the Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat delivered the speech in Nagpur, and as is custom, it was long and layered. In the context of issues that are in the news, here are some of the key takeaways. Bhagwat reiterated that “border security” is an “issue of foremost consideration” for the RSS. A powerful army is an essential component of the RSS’s imagination of a strong nation and therefore central to its idea of nationalism. More interestingly, he unequivocally stood up for the government in this regard, praising the efforts “being initiated and accelerated to enhance the morale of our armed and security forces, making them well-equipped and to provide them with latest technologies”, adding that, “this is one of the reasons that the prestige of Bharat is rising in the world.” Given that the RSS keenly participated in the anti-corruption movement against the UPA government, and Bhagwat has gone as far as to say that Anna Hazare started the movement at the behest of the RSS, either they have inside information that exonerates the government of wrongdoing, or have decided to support the party and its leaders irrespective, in the wider interest of the RSS’s goals. Perhaps Bhagwat’s strongest statements were made on the subject of internal security. He lashed out against those who “sow and grow the seeds of doubt, detachment, imprudence, rebellion, hatred and violence in the weaker sections of the society that are severely affected due to the deprivation, injustice and negligence” in order to use them as “cannon fodder for anti-national activities”. Critics might argue that this is exactly what the RSS’s propaganda is aimed at, but Bhagwat’s barbs were directed at “the selfish power hungry politics with sheer disrespect for the social harmony, legal and Constitutional discipline and with an eye on votes in the upcoming elections” that has been making “continuous efforts for the last four years” to destabilize the government and the country. He described these forces as the “neo-left”. He also endorsed the term “urban naxals” that originated in the netherverse of social media, describing them as thought leaders who stay “within the social order and civic discipline”, are “established in social and other media, intellectual circles and other institutions”, and defend ‘anti-national’ activities “through intellectual and other methods, through delusory public campaigns related to agitations, while keeping a safe distance and maintaining their so-called eminent positions.” While he did not name any of these thought leaders in particular, it is possibly reasonable to assume that the five prominent activists who were recently arrested from across the country would fit the bill. As might any number of journalists, intellectuals, activists, artists, and historians who are routinely called “anti-national” and “urban naxals” on social media for speaking against the government. If there was any ambiguity on the RSS’s position on the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, Bhagwat made it very clear that they believe it to be misguided. As per its mandate, the Supreme Court analysed the matter through the prism of Constitutional rights. The judgment delivered was based on the interpretation of Rule 3(b), framed by the Government under the authority of the 1965 Kerala Hindu Places of Worship (Authorisation of Entry Act), as juxtaposed against constitutional provisions such as Article 25(1) (freedom of worship), Article 26 (freedom of religious denominations to regulate their own practices), and Articles 14 and 15(1) (equality and non-discrimination). Other RSS ideologues have been saying that ‘real women devotees’ do not want to challenge the ‘sanctity of the temple’, implying that the women who petitioned the court for their right to enter the temple, may have vested interests. Bhagwat subtly endorsed this view by adding that, “the plea by a large section of women, who follows this tradition, was not heard.” This assertion is not entirely comprehensible given that the Supreme Court has earlier ruled against the Haji Ali Dargah Trust to allow the entry of women into the Dargah. But it is line with the RSS’s larger belief that secularism, as practiced by the Indian state before the 2014, has ‘appeased’ certain minority groups at the expense of Hindus Going by Bhagwat’s speech the RSS’s measured tone of consensus building has given way to an assertive demand for the Ram temple. He put the onus of building it as soon as possible squarely on the government. He also criticised the plea made to the Supreme Court by some minority groups to defer the judgment until after the 2019 elections, warning that, “it is in nobody’s interest to test the patience of the society without any reason.” These are unambiguous words that the government will probably find difficult to ignore. Three things stood out when Bhagwat spoke of the upcoming elections. Firstly, that he addressed them at all given that the RSS continues to insist it is detached from party politics. Secondly, that he had two very specific messages for   to follow and spread – no one should vote NOTA and voting should be for “national interest” rather than “parochial feelings, petty egos of caste, language and provincial affiliations”. And thirdly, that all   are to “put their strength behind the overall national good.” The RSS clearly believes that it is the BJP that stands to gain if voting is not done on parochial lines because as of now the RSS and BJP firmly lead the discourse and influence the common perception on what is in the “national interest.” It is also evident that like in 2014 the RSS intends to back the BJP in the 2019 general elections through its cadres, because despite small differences, the current government is the RSS’s best ally when it comes to the organisation’s long-term goals. The speech ended with Bhagwat saying that “Bharat is the Hindu Rashtra” and that any “sections of the society who consider themselves ‘separate’ because of their religion, tradition and lifestyle or apprehensive of the word ‘Hindu’ need to understand that Hindutva is the eternal ethos of this country.” As per the RSS this ethos harks back to a golden period of Hindu civilization, unadulterated by the assimilated cultures of Muslim and British rulers from outside the country. But this speech, for all the attention it gets, is primarily the Sarsanghchalak’s declamation of his vision for the RSS and its affiliates. And its intended audience knows how to read between the lines and reconcile what might seem like contradictions to those on the outside. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Smitha TK,"Vishal Kumar Syed Shiyaz Mirza The countdown has begun. In just a few days, the gates of the Sabarimala temple will be opened to all men   women. But for this, many in Kerala are fuming. On 28 September, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by former chief justice Dipak Misra lifted the ban on the entry of women of all ages into the shrine. Thousands of people including women have taken to the streets condemning the legislature for intruding into tradition and faith. The Kerala government has however promised full cooperation in implementing the court order and is busy making arrangements. Sabarimala is a Hindu pilgrimage centre situated in the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. Every year over 15 million devotees visit the temple. Legend has it that there once was a kingdom of Pandalam where the royal family was childless. One day, the king found a baby boy in a forest. He adopted the baby and named him Manikanda. A few years later, the queen gave birth to a boy. At the age of 12, when the king wanted to formally anoint Manikanda as the heir, the queen, under the influence of an evil minister, objected. She wanted to make her biological child the next king. The queen sent Maanikanda to the forest to fetch ""tigress' milk"" to cure her illness. To everyone’s surprise, Manikanda returned with the milk riding a tigress. The kingdom realised he was a divine being. However, Manikanda renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic. He then shot an arrow into what became the Sabarimala and the young boy transformed into Ayyappan. Since time immemorial, only pre-menstrual and post menopausal women were allowed entry. In 1991, the Kerala High Court specified the age limit (below 10 years and above 50 years). The pilgrimage to Sabarimala requires devotees to hold 41 days of  . The devotee who has taken the vow is required to strictly follow rules that include following a lacto-vegetarian diet, celibacy, teetotalism, avoidance of profanity and only wearing a plain black or blue coloured traditional clothing. Those who do not follow the   are allowed in through a separate entrance, and may not climb up the last 18 steps to the shrine. The present verdict has challenged a belief system that has been in place for decades. We asked the women of Kerala whether they approved of the verdict. Their opinions were divided. Some women said that they have grown up listening to the legend and vehemently oppose the legislature interfering with such an ancient practice. “Sabarimala is an ecologically sensitive place. I am not saying women cannot go there but it is very difficult. For women, you need to make establishments for stay, proper toilets, a sustainable waste management system. This is why there is a rule women shouldn't go. Only a limited number of people should visit,” said Devi Sanjay from Trivandrum. Sandhya from Trivandrum also echoed the same sentiments. She says that women will not be able to keep the vow for 41 days and so should not go to Sabarimala. Many young women, on the other hand, also believe that ‘regressive’ traditions have to change and this order has been long overdue. Some say that it is high time we stop looking at women as impure beings and accept menstruation as just another bodily function. “No one can restrict us from entering any place. It is our right to go where we want to. Just because we are female and go through menstruation from the age of 15-45, we are not able to go to temples. I don’t see any logic here,” said Hashifa from Kannur. Other women said that they might not go to Sabarimala but they are glad that it will be up to them to make that choice. The temple will open its doors for all on 17 October and the Kerala government is making all arrangements to ensure complete security for women. But the mood is quite tense as tempers continue to soar high. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Nikhil Borwankar,"Typically, when an investor desires to invest any significant sum of money into a new project, she undertakes an extensive “due diligence” exercise to determine the viability of the project and ascertain the credentials of the project’s promoters. Financial experts are engaged to calculate the economic feasibility of the project and its projected outcomes. Top notch law firms are engaged to undertake a deep dive into the legal history of the project, its promoters and key management personnel.

In its statement to the media on 21 September, Dassault asserted, “This offsets contract is delivered in compliance with the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 regulations. In this framework, and in accordance with the policy of Make in India, Dassault Aviation has decided to make a partnership with India’s Reliance Group. This is Dassault Aviation’s choice [...]”. The Department of Defence echoed this stand a day later in its media statement on 22 September, asserting that, “The government has stated earlier, and again reiterates that it had no role in the selection of Reliance Defence as the offset partner”. Is it not a farce then, that public funds are routed into private Indian corporations through a foreign intermediary, without any public scrutiny? And without any public overseeing in the selection of the private partner, the due diligence exercise undertaken by the foreign investor assumes even greater significance, to ensure those precious funds are not squandered by the local partner. It is in this connection that the following facts merit highlighting. In the 21 September media statement, Dassault made one key assertion when it stated that, “This partnership (Dassault-Reliance) has led to the creation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint-venture in February 2017”. It is relevant, therefore, to take a closer look at the facts that were available to Dassault in February 2017, when it decided to formalise its decision to partner with Reliance by entering into the DRAL JV. The answer is readily available, particularly in the 2G scam cases. The CBI’s chargesheet and other documents were a matter of public record. And while the allegations in the chargesheet were enough to scare away any investor, it does not appear to have bothered Dassault. But it is the testimonies of the key personnel of Reliance that had the potential to bring any proposed JV to a grinding halt. All these testimonies were already part of public record. Legally speaking, this meant that the CBI alleged that these employees had given one version of events to the agency during investigations, and were now singing a contrarian tune in court. The prosecution alleged that they had all deposed falsely under oath. But if the due diligence exercise were to highlight a single issue, it would be the fact that Anil Ambani himself, and even his wife, were  , both alleged by the prosecution to have deposed falsely and concealed information from the court. During his testimony, Ambani admitted that he had in fact been examined by the CBI during the investigations in the 2G scam cases. As is the procedure during investigations, the Investigating Officer (IO) records the statement of each relevant witness and shows it to him. The witness himself is not asked to sign the statement, as that is barred by law. This leaves a lacuna, that, in my opinion, is exploited by some ill- intentioned police officers to record false statements, to falsely implicate certain persons. But Ambani was not accused in this case. He stated instead that, “I was examined by the CBI. However, I do not know if any statement of mine was recorded or not. I remained present in the CBI office for many hours and I do not recall any statement being recorded and there were a number of people present”. He even denied ever handing over a typed note containing his replies to specific queries of the CBI, stating, “It is wrong to suggest that I had given any typed note to the IO during my visit to the CBI office”. One of the scions of the illustrious Dhirubhai Ambani Group would have the court believe that the CBI had the gumption to falsely record his statement, and produce a typed note that he had never actually supplied. Reliance Telecom, along with three of its executives, was acquitted in the 2G case eventually in 2017. This was the testimony of the undisputed boss of Dassault’s chosen corporate partner, on 22 August 2013, nearly four years prior to the DRAL JV. He further testified that he “cannot recall” if one of his group’s lead companies, Reliance Telecom, had made a thousand crore rupees investment in Swan Telecom, another accused company. In fact, during his eighteen-page examination by the prosecution, Mr Ambani was unable to   on twenty occasions. These included his   with regard to investments in associated companies, funds transfers worth thousands of crores, board meetings in which he was shown to have been present, and even transfers of shares held by himself, his wife and his own children. Presumably, this was brought to the Dassault management’s notice during the due diligence phase. Whether it was also disclosed to its shareholders, is anybody’s guess. Distressingly, this information was also available to the government. In fact, on the one hand, the government was prosecuting one of Ambani’s companies in the 2G scam while simultaneously according sanction to another in a deal worth billions of dollars. All without even awaiting the verdict. One wonders if similar offsets deals with a group company belonging to a Vijay Mallya or a Nirav Modi would be equally championed. They too, after all, are innocent until proven guilty. Meanwhile, following 2G case acquittals in 2017, Anil Ambani   a “redemption” to the humilation his company had faced over the years. So what do foreign investors really look for in a prospective Indian partner? Are these “choices” made on merit? Do these investors evaluate the liabilities in the balance sheets of potential partners, or pending litigation? What’s clear is that the absence of public oversight or a regulatory mechanism in the process of selection of a private partner in offsets-related deals can allow some individuals to manipulate the levers of power to siphon away billions in public funds, even as the masses toil away, unable even to escape a month’s default in EMIs.

C Uday Bhaskar,"While the tragic fate of  Jamal Khashoggi, the US journalist of Saudi Arabian origin is dominating the news cycle globally, a rather intriguing report alleging an ‘assassination plot’ has caused a mini-stir in the South Asian teacup. Media reports emanating from Colombo on 16 October made for dramatic headlines – the gist being that the Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena had alleged at a cabinet meeting, that an Indian national was part of a plot to assassinate him. The exact quote attributed to Mr Sirisena reads as: “The Indian national must be a RAW agent trying to kill me. The Indian PM may not be aware. That is often the case. Trump may not be aware of CIA’s similar moves.” Was the latter a subtle reference to the Khashoggi case? To calm the storm in the India-Sri Lanka teacup, Sirisena called Indian PM Narendra Modi on 17 October, and said that his remarks had been misquoted / distorted by the media and assured Modi that his government was cognisant of the importance of the bi-lateral ties they shared. Both leaders reiterated the importance of the friendship between the two countries. Concurrently there was frenzied action on Wednesday, 17 October, and as many as three different statements were issued by Colombo to contain the damage and embarrassment. While the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs gravely noted that it was “disappointing”  that the President’s remarks had been distorted  and taken out of context, the office of the Cabinet of Ministers (equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary) noted that the news items in the media as reported on Tuesday, 16 October, “are totally false.” The Indian national in question is one M Thomas who was in the news in September for ostensibly being part of a plot to assassinate the Sri Lankan President and the former Defence Ministry Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The Sri Lankan anti corruption department apparently exposed the plot and in a rather convenient manner; it was alleged that Kumar was found  carrying his RAW identification documents. Sri Lankan political leaders have a deeply embedded paranoia about assassinations and these are not unfounded. It may be recalled that Sri Lanka’s founding political leader SWRD Bandaranaike (who sowed the seeds of Sinhala nationalism), the Prime Minister of erstwhile Ceylon in the 1950’s met a tragic end when he was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959. Subsequently, his wife, and  later their daughter, led the island nation at different points in time. The emergence of the Tamil movement for a separate identity that morphed into the LTTE, led to a spate of killings/assassinations and the better known among these include another President Ranasinghe Premadasa (1993) and a presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake , who, with 51 other victims, was killed in a bomb blast during an election rally in Colombo in 1994. Along with the deeply-embedded anxiety about assassinations per se in Sri Lankan politics, there has been a deeply-held conviction bordering on certitude, in some quarters in Colombo, that India and its external intelligence agency R&AW (Research and Analysis Wing) are behind every major political upheaval in the island.  This perception which was latent in the early 1970’s after the birth of Bangladesh, has gained strength in Sri Lanka after India’s disastrous attempt to play the role of a broker and later peacekeeper, in the complex ethnic politics of the island nation. The feckless policies pursued by then PM Rajiv Gandhi and the contradictory politics that had Delhi and Chennai on different tracks not only resulted in the loss of precious Indian lives (the ill-conceived IPKF operation) but added to the abiding suspicion about  Delhi and the larger than life profile accorded to the RAW in the internal dynamic of Sri Lanka. Professionals recall a widely publicised event at the time when an Indian RAW officer was honey-trapped by the CIA in a Colombo-Chennai trapeze.  It is now averred that Beijing has a robust but little  noticed presence in the island that is seeking to exploit the distinctive maritime location of  Sri Lanka for futuristic intelligence operations in space and cyber. Espionage and high profile political assassination plots are sensational when they are brought into the public domain but often evaporate under objective scrutiny. So, was it domestic politics in Colombo that stirred the India-Sri Lanka tea-cup so visibly?   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

"Anil Sharma, Political Analyst","In a major jolt to the ruling BJP government in Rajasthan, Manvendra Singh Jasol, son of one of the founding members of the BJP and a former Union minister Jaswant Singh, has joined the Congress – only a couple of months before the state assembly elections. Courteous, polite and charismatic, Manvendra, who hails from Western part of Rajasthan and is a Rajput by caste, will make a difference in the upcoming polls to be held on 7 December in Rajasthan. Both the Congress and the BJP know about it. The Rajput community is already angry with the BJP in Rajasthan. Rajputs constitute over 7-8 percent of the total voteshare in Rajasthan, and is a dominating force in around 30-35 of the total 200 constituencies in the state. AICC General Secretary and State In-Charge Avinash Pande, also played an important role in this. The Rajput community’s anger is basically directed at the way Jaswant Singh was treated by the BJP including Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The veteran BJP leader was not only denied a ticket, but to add salt to injury, his ticket was offered to Col Sonaram who, just before the Lok Sabha polls had switched over from the Congress to the BJP. Jaswant Singh considered it as matter of prestige, and fought as an independent candidate from Barmer-Jaisalmer constituency. Though he lost the elections, he won Rajput sympathy. The BJP is also facing the heat from the Rajput community who were traditionally BJP loyalists, over the encounter of gangster Anandpal, and Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmavati being Padmavat. They also voted against BJP during the recent by-polls for two Lok Sabha seats and one assembly seat, held earlier in January 2018. Jaswant Singh’s family has clout especially in western Rajasthan as they hail from this area, and this part of Rajasthan has a large Rajput population. To this effect, Rajendra Singh Rathore (a Rajput leader and a minister in Vasundhara Raje’s Cabinet) has said that, “his (Manvendra) exit will make no difference to Rajput community.” The panic in the BJP camp is evident from the fact that soon after Manvendra announced his exit, at least two to three BJP MLAs and ministers (mainly Rajputs) came forward to speak on the issue. Rao Rajendra Singh, the deputy speaker in the present Rajasthan Assembly, was quoted as saying, “Individuals are not bigger than the party”. Even Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Union minister and another BJP leader, also came out to speak against Manvendra’s decision and said, “Congress has always mistreated Rajputs.” His presence in Congress is likely to make the party stronger, especially in the western part of Rajasthan and more so in Barmer and Jaisalmer belt, where BJP presently has 8 MLAs out of 9 assembly constituencies. The big question now is: will Manvendra fight elections from the assembly or the Lok Sabha? None of the Congress leaders is ready to talk or comment about it thus far. But as far as political understanding goes, his wife Chitra Singh is likely to fight the assembly polls from Sheo in Barmer district which is his husband's present constituency, while Manvendra may contest Lok Sabha polls. This is highly probable, as Harish Chaudhary, the Congress candidate in 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Barmer-Jaisalmer constituency (who lost badly) may contest assembly polls from any one of the 9 constituencies in Barmer and Jaisalmer area. And thus, the Congress will have no other option but to go with Manvendra Singh.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

He added that the figure had dropped to 20 percent. Azad indirectly targeted the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party for this change having said that the mindset had changed over the last four years. Additionally, he said that certain group of people from a particular party were trying to defame Aligarh Muslim University,  reported. Over the last few years, there has been a debate around AMU's minority institution tag.

Mekhala Saran,"In potentially controversial remarks that could provoke a backlash, Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan on Wednesday, 17 October, said the #MeToo movement was started by ""people with perverted minds"" and wondered if it was fair to level accusations over incidents that happened years ago. The BJP leader made the comments in response to questions by reporters, amid the raging #MeToo storm in India, which saw multiple women levelling sexual harassment allegations against former minister MJ Akbar. Akbar, who edited many mainstream publications before joining politics, resigned as Union Minister of State for External Affairs on 17 October, after a host of his former women journalist colleagues accused him of sexual harassment. ""This (MeToo movement) is the result of the behaviour of some people who have perverted minds,"" Radhakrishnan, Union Minister of State for Shipping and Finance said. Noting that the 'MeToo' movement had sullied the image of the country and women, he wondered if it would be right for men to start ""making similar accusations like them"". ""That will be such a big insult....Will it be acceptable?"" Radhakrishnan said.

Amrita Bhinder,"The MJ Akbar case is a textbook study of how things could pan out, when folks are accused of crimes, including one like that of ‘sexual harassment’. The media reported that MJ Akbar has – 97 lawyers, (who are part of the law firm representing him), against a one woman, namely, Priya Ramani, who was the first to call out his ‘predatory’ behaviour. Being a lawyer myself, I can say that it’s a common practice followed by most firms, to list their litigating lawyers in a  , so as to avoid a back-and-forth with a client, as the case may go through many forums, and different lawyers may be needed for pleadings, motions, scheduling conference, trial, order and appeal et al. However, for long-term impact, the media needs to change the way it engages with the public. For any coherent conclusion to come out from the force that #MeTooIndia has become, it’s important for women to take a fair stand, regardless of the urgency to pronounce someone guilty. Equality before the law and due process is vital for the #MeToo⁠⁠campaign to not fizzle out or lose steam. Also, it is only obvious and hardly shocking, that political parties, media houses in search for TRPs, and a few looking to settle scores, at whatever cost, would misuse this campaign. The onus lies on women and men, who understand the issue and are looking to help, that there might not be anything better than a #MeToo or #TimesUp movement to clean up the cesspool of patriarchy muddled with sexual harassment that had seeped into nearly all major spheres of life. Be it the media that is considered the fourth estate of democracy, films where women are labeled ‘stars’ and ‘goddesses’ or politics where the women are considered to be ‘leaders’, there is nearly no space left where women haven’t been hurt. Sexual abuse is never just about lust, it is also about power dynamics. Sexual harassment of women has become such a rampant malaise as it is a culmination of women being objectified, oppressed by the patriarchy at home and work, and impunity offered to men, with the perpetrators knowing they can ‘get away with it’. It has addressed sexual harassment by naming and shaming predators, be it in the United States, or in a plenary session of the  , and it has finally reached India where it has taken off the blinders in more ways than one. But for this campaign to continue thriving, it is imperative that the survivors understand what they are up against. If someone is being called out on a social media post it’s only natural that there is going to be a fight back, a denial and in some cases, the person being called out could also sue for defamation. It’s very difficult for people, both men and women, to introspect why they did what they allegedly did back then, as memory can be quite subjective, and two people could have a completely different memory, and understanding of the same incident. Women should be ready to back-up their claims because most issues will end up in court if there is a denial by the perpetrator, and ‘hearsay’, ‘I say’ or ‘We all say’ may not stand to the tests of judicial or quasi-judicial systems. To put it in other words, for the #MeToo campaign to be truly successful, people need to be okay with being held accountable. To my mind, ‘resignations’, ‘self introspection’ or an ‘apology’ shouldn’t cut it just yet. If allegations and claims don’t go through due process and aren’t truly backed, it could set it all up for yet another disappointing display of human failure. Once we take all necessary steps, life in general may become easier for women –imagine being able to travel in a metro or a crowded bus without constantly looking over your shoulder – sometimes that is all that is needed to make the world a better place.

Swati Gautam,"MJ Akbar has resigned after bequeathing us a case study that clearly indicates how reactions spur actions, how silence is truly golden and more so, how being contrite still works no matter how old fashioned it may be. My mind frantically whirls to the developments of the past few days: Priya, Ghazala and others speaking up one after the other followed by MJ’s continuing silence while abroad; my hope that he was writing a neat clear apology for the sins of his misplaced loins fizzling in a shroud of a continuing puzzling silence. I mean how could he   know how to apologise? Did the brilliant mind that he used to then have not realise that the accusations were coming in from far too many, too quickly, and in a manner that only meant that these girls then, women now, were angry, really angry at how he breached all etiquette and values with us when we were young and trusting? Having lost my father barely a fortnight back, the saga landed firmly in my lap when MJ seemingly unleashed 97 lawyers on Priya. The cheek of the Bathrobe! To call us liars when all he should have done was to keep mum and then apologise. And then fight it out in court provided   filed charges. To abrogate virtue from those wronged incessantly was the blunder that MJ heaped upon himself. Today a few pertinent points are emerging out of this case study. Firstly, that MJ must also resign from the Rajya Sabha since this saga negates his nomination to the Upper House as a respected citizen worthy of that nomination. Thereafter, he is free to fight us and look into 37 pairs of determined eyes and deny that he ever paraded his bounties in bathrobes to us, or forced his slobbering stale saliva onto scared members of his staff. Secondly, and very importantly, I am seeing a lot of nice, good men around me very worried about how these movements shall make the going difficult for everyone: that women shall not be employed any more, that men will be falsely accused etcetera etcetera. To that I say, relax. As for employment opportunities for young girls, well my dear friends, we were not employed all these years because we were safe of otherwise; our careers have been built on merit and sincerity and that’s a quality the world shall always need us for. Thirdly, this recurrent question being thrown at us about the law of limitation and the time taken by us to speak up  is certainly a matter of concern. The moot point here is that beyond the boundaries of a man made law, there is a time and a place for everything. Had the same me spoken up either to my colleagues at the St Xavier’s College (Cal) Alumni/ae Association or to my parents , I would have had to answer questions about why I went to the airport, to Taj Bengal, to his room blah blah blah. Such were the times. Isn’t it natural as part of our survival instinct to wait to open up when we are stable and settled and when the time is more conducive for us to fight for justice? Fourthly, I am certain that norms and laws shall emerge out of this saga of a few puny women staring back unflinchingly at the might of a once admired giant. Yes we will welcome them. Yes we also know that every travesty of justice whether towards a man or a woman is a blot on society as a whole but the way forward is to move forward with hope and courage and faith, and certainly not with pessimism and fear and mistrust. Lastly, I very strongly feel that we women as a whole have been more marginalised in a patriarchal society forever than any other group whatsoever, to the extent that we have internalised the unfairness and cloaked it with our never ending tolerance and propensity to maintain peace. Our strengths must not be taken for granted any more. If the SC/ST Commission can have teeth then why not the Women’s Commission too? Let our constitutional rights be ours instead of us needing to fight our way through overworked and dingy police stations which are ill-equipped to deal with  not just the volume of such instances but also the sensitivity we need at times such as these. And yes, let us also be the mothers who take pride in bringing up boys worthy of this earth.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Vatsala Singh and Mythreyee Ramesh,"Editor extraordinaire, celebrated author, and now a former Union minister MJ Akbar is also, most importantly, an accused in multiple incidents of sexual harassment. After almost 214 hours after the allegations, Akbar resigned from his post on Wednesday, 17 October. At least twelve women journalists have accused the recently-resigned Minister of State for External Affairs Akbar of sexually harassing them, while he was working as an editor of a newspaper. From intimidating them at work with sexual innuendoes, to violating consent, conducting uncomfortable interviews – the women have come forward and shared detailed accounts of the alleged harassment. A day after finally breaking his silence on the allegations, MJ Akbar on Monday, 15 October, filed a complaint against Priya Ramani, the first woman to publicly call him out, for criminal defamation under Section 500 of the IPC. The 41-page complaint was filed at the Patiala House District Court on his behalf by the law firm Karanjawala & Co, and argues that Ramani “willfully, deliberately, intentionally and maliciously” defamed Akbar on “wholly and completely false, frivolous, unjustifiable and scandalous grounds”. Earlier, on 14 October, Akbar released a statement asserting that these allegations are being levelled only due to the upcoming elections. “Why has this storm risen a few months before a general election? Is there an agenda? You be the judge. These false, baseless and wild allegations have caused irreparable damage to my reputation and goodwill,” he said. He also repeatedly insisted that he “never did anything.” However, the women who have accused Akbar are ready to fight. And their fight is not theirs alone. Seventeen other women journalists who have worked with   newspaper, which Akbar edited, came out in support of their colleague Ramani, said a joint statement issued by them.

Amitabh Tiwari,"Social media today is the most popular medium of communication, due to its immediacy. According to Statista, the number of social media users in India is 226 million (2018) and this is expected to go up to 336 million by 2021. The 2014 Lok Sabha elections witnessed a significant usage of social media by political parties and leaders, especially the BJP and their then PM designate Narendra Modi to disseminate their ideology, policies and programmes and highlight the shortcomings / corruption-related scandals of the previous regime. The Congress had a weak social media presence back then. All this helped in creating what is called the ‘Modi wave’, and led to BJP sweeping the 2014 polls. After 2014, most political parties realised the importance of social media and registered their presence on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. The 2014 general election is touted as India’s first “social media election”. Social media impacted results of 30 to 40 percent of the total seats, according to BJP IT Cell Head Arvind Gupta. This is expected to go up to 60 percent by the 2019 general elections. Social media has emerged as a new battleground for political parties. The Congress, which was lagging behind BJP, has pulled up its socks. This turnaround has happened since Gujarat elections 2017. Today, the Congress and Rahul Gandhi are very active, even aggressively so, on Twitter and Facebook. Narendra Modi has five times the followers Rahul Gandhi has. Despite this, Rahul Gandhi’s average retweets and likes are much higher than Modi’s. This shows that the Congress is a strong match to BJP’s might on social media, and has created its own army of volunteers, influencers and verified handles, which play an important role in getting to trend on Twitter. Twitter wars between Congress and BJP is a regular affair. Who would have thought, even a year ago, that one day the hashtag #MeraPMChorHai would trend on Twitter nationally. BJP, not one to lose, made a comeback with #RahulKaPuraKhandanChor. The hashtags used by the Congress of late are fast gaining popularity. An analysis of top Twitter trends of September 2018 shows Congress as being marginally ahead of BJP. However, on Facebook, Modi and the BJP’s dominance is intact. Modi is way ahead of Rahul Gandhi and BJP is also much ahead of Congress on Facebook. Facebook’s user base is almost 7 times the number of Twitter users in India. Thus, Facebook’s outreach is greater. According to Statista, in 2019, internet users in India are expected to reach 407 million. About 65 percent of India’s population is within the age group 18-35. This group spends almost 4 hours on the internet. Political parties are therefore targeting this group of voters for mobilisation, as most of them use Twitter / Facebook to consume news. Mobile internet rates plunged by 93 percent while data usage per user surged by over 25 times in three years to 2017 as per the Department of Telecom’s data. This is driving internet growth. Congress has beefed up its presence, and so have many regional parties on social media platforms. This is likely to prevent the free run BJP enjoyed in 2014 elections as ‘early adopters’, and make the battle interesting.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Arun Dev,"The by-election for the Ballari Lok Sabha seat was pitched as a precursor to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With Ballari’s two strongmen – Congress’ DK Shivakumar and BJP’s B Sriramalu – the by-election was expected to be a showdown. But the stakes have been lowered with the Congress unexpectedly fielding a complete outsider for what had promised to be a hotly contested electoral fight. S Ugrappa is, a Congress MLC, was on 15 October, was fielded as the Congress’ contender from Ballari, which in 1999 witnessed the high profile battle between in Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj Ostensibly, the Congress party was prompted to go against DK Shivakumar’s wishes to avoid an internal conflict with the Jarkiholi brothers with whom he is at loggerheads over political control over North Karnataka. With no forseeable solution, Congress legislative party leader Siddaramaiah decided to field an outsider. Although Ugrappa, a native of Tumkuru district in south Karnataka, is an unlikely candidate to contest an election in north Karnataka, he was active in the campaign against illegal mining in Ballari between 2008 and 2013. The campaign against illegal mining of Reddy brothers helped the party win the 2013 Assembly polls. When asked about his chances of victory, Ugrappa told reporters that the ‘outsider tag’ will not affect him and his clean image would help him win the elections. But Ugrappa will be contesting the elections against senior BJP leader and mining baron B Sriramalu’s sister Shanta. The seat was earlier held by Sriramalu, who vacated the post to contest the Assembly polls in May 2018. A Congress leader, however, pointed out that whoever wins this elections would serve as an MP for a mere five months. In such a case, the party’s stability was more important than a bypoll. When Jarkiholi brothers demanded that DKS be removed as the minister in charge of Ballari, the alternative candidate they proposed was B Nagendra, an MLA from Ballari. So, when Nagendra pitched his brother Venkatesh Prasad as the candidate for Lok Sabha by-election, the Jarkiholi brothers supported the decision. However, DK Shivakumar was not happy and proposed a set of candidates from his end. It was just a month ago that an ego clash between the Jarkiholi brothers – Ramesh and Satish – and DK Shivakumar had threatened the stability of the coalition government. The brothers, who enjoyed control over north Karnataka’s politics for several years, were opposed to DK Shivakumar, a leader from the south, taking control over cooperative banks in north Karnataka’s Belagavi district. Things soon turned ugly. The two brothers threatened to quit the party if DK Shivakumar “did not stop interfering with the politics of the districts in north Karnataka”. They were also opposed to him being the minister in charge of Ballari, an important district in the region. After several rounds of negotiations, the party leadership convinced the Jarkiholi brothers that DK Shivakumar will be asked to stay away from north Karnataka. They were also promised that DKS will be replaced by a local MLA, as the minister-in-charge for the district. However, as the Cabinet expansion was delayed in the first week of October, DKS continued as the minister in charge of Ballari. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Singh (54), who won Barmer's Sheo constituency as the BJP candidate in 2013 assembly elections, had announced at a rally last month that he is leaving the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress leaders claimed his move will help bring Rajput votes to the party-fold while the BJP said the MLA's politically wrong decision will have no impact on the ruling party. Manvendra Singh will join the Congress on October 17 in Delhi in the presence of party president Rahul Gandhi, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot told PTI on Tuesday. “There is a long list of leaders quitting the BJP and the party should introspect why this is happening,” he said and added that Congress is welcoming Manvendra Singh and this will strengthen the party. He added the party will ensure his active participation in the upcoming assembly elections in the state. Rajasthan's Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Rathore claimed Singh's decision is a political misstep and he should have thought before switching sides. “The Congress is helpless. Therefore it is adopting sidelined BJP leaders. It is his personal decision but this is a politically wrong decision. He is not going to get anything with this,” Rathore told reporters at Ranakpur in Pali. As for the Rajput votes, Rathore said the community has traditionally voted for the BJP. “There will be no impact of this as the Rajput votes will remain with the BJP only,” he said. “The Congress party is going to gain when Manvendra joins Congress,” Khan said. In western Rajasthan, the Rajput vote is often considered a deciding factor on many seats.

He then contested elections as an independent and lost the seat to BJP's Sonaram, who had joined the party after switching from the Congress. There was resentment among Jaswant Singh supporters over the denial of the BJP ticket for the veteran, and they blamed Vasundhara Raje for this.

Editorial,"‘15-minute fame’ (shame on those who use such expressions), ‘political conspiracy to malign me and my party’, ‘attempts to damage reputation’ — these are some of the defenses used by many who have been called out in the ongoing #MeToo movement in India. In fact, he has gone a step further and has filed a criminal defamation case against the first of the many accusers. Now we have a situation where one accuser is pitted against a union minister who is backed by a team of 97 lawyers. Akbar’s statement on Sunday, which spoke of a ‘conspiracy’ against him and subsequent legal challenges the following day, is telling of the kind of personality he comes across as now. He should have quit his membership from the union council of ministers on moral grounds. But then again, rules of morality apply to lesser mortals – not to a high-profile editor-turned-politician like M J Akbar. The principles of public probity demand that he should step aside till the trial is over. If he is not willing to fall in line, the onus is on the prime minister to set high standards and relieve him of all his duties with immediate effect. From all the accusations that are in the public domain, it seems that Akbar, the then editor, took his manhood’s superiority for granted. His so-called star power was a bait to lure unsuspecting women who would be shocked out of their wits, having found themselves in the most unexpected of situations — formal meetings in hotel rooms in which Akbar was clad in nothing but a bathrobe, uncomfortable encounters in his office cabins, and even in cars. Women’s testimonies have described all these shocking situations in detail. By mounting a legal challenge against the survivors, Akbar has shown that he believes in the superiority of men vis-à-vis women. How can – what prima facie looks like a case of perversion and sexual exploitation of women – be any different for him or his backers? Perhaps, he and his backers stand for macho nationalism that believes in   women. And if needed, abusing them. Silencing and intimidation are two of its potent tools. It thrives on the mistaken belief that “I am a star and therefore entitled to all the perks coming my way”. The proponents of such a perverse line think that “since I am a star, I have the infinite power to make a star out of ordinary mortals. All that I want in return is some gratification, sexual or otherwise. How can lesser mortals say no to me, the proprietor of a factory churning out stars?” Mr Akbar, macho nationalism may have worked for you thus far, as scores of women have alleged. But time to make amends now. The least you could have done was tender an unconditional apology to all the women you have offended. You have gone on the offensive instead, adding salt to their injured souls. You can still make amends by stepping down immediately and face a trial. Think of the survivors for a while. They have come out now, mindful of great personal and professional risks involved, after suffering years of pain. How humiliated they must have felt when they were at the receiving end of, what they considered, unwanted sexual advances? Can you ever empathise with them? For a government that shouts   from rooftops, not taking a stand now in this case, amounts to insulting all the daughters who feel threatened by the high and mighty. BJP leadership may be seen as giving tacit support to this perverse brand of macho nationalism. Macho nationalism, as we have seen thus far, is anathema to democratic ethos. And to the brave women who have spoken out, we are with you. You are the torchbearers of this movement, and the least we can do is support you in your long and arduous journey in search of justice.

Arpita Raj,"“As a Hindu, obviously, I am conscious that a vast majority of my fellow Hindus believe that that was the specific birthplace of Ram. For this reason, most good Hindus would want to see a Ram temple at the site where Ram was supposed to be born. But I also believe that no good Hindu would have wanted that a temple be built by demolishing somebody else’s place of worship.” This simple statement by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor made at The Hindu Lit for Life Dialogue and lecture series in Chennai on 14 October, assumed epic proportions over the past weekend, becoming the subject of primetime TV news coverage and a political fight between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Sparking a fairly ridiculous good Hindu versus bad Hindu debate online as well as in TV studios across the country (starring ‘celebrity’ panelists to boot), the knee-jerk and poorly thought out handling of the subject made it clear that most television media was grasping at straws to amass TRPs. While the harmless import of the message might be plain for most people to see, it was not long before TV channels modified the meaning to do the most damage and crunch the quote, to serve their own agenda. Mainstream television channels branded Tharoor and the Congress party “anti-Hindu” and accused them of opposing the re-building of the temple at a time when the Supreme Court is less than two weeks away from ruling on the matter. BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra appeared on a host of major news channels, asserting his stance as a ‘proud Hindu’ and accusing the Congress party of targeting Hindus. While other leading news channels posed questions like – “Who’s a Good Hindu?’ with two options – ‘For Ram Mandir’ or ‘Against Ram Mandir’. Not only did the channel reduce the decades old contentious debate into an unfair religious binary (see the screenshot below) but also sought to classify Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s father, Rajiv Gandhi as a Good/Bad Hindu when it asked – “Does Tharoor think Rajiv Gandhi was a “bad Hindu” for allowing puja inside the disputed structure in 1989?” From #congmandirduplicity to #congopposesmandir, the stance of mainstream media was fairly conspicuous. Assured of grabbing eye-balls and amassing high TRP ratings, the channels cashed in on the controversy, without waiting to clarify or cross-check the actual words spoken. Speaking on a popular news channel, MP Subramanian Swamy questioned Tharoor’s authority in these matters and even alluded to his ongoing lawsuit in his wife Sunanda Pushkar’s death. “He is no authority on Hinduism. Who is he to decide... Is he arrogating himself spiritual powers or religious authority?” he said. He also added, “He’s (Tharoor) under strain as he was being chargesheeted and can go to jail at any time, complicity in the death of his wife, so maybe he is cracking up and therefore he’s talking like this.” Addressing a press conference, GVL Narasimha Rao, BJP’s national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP, said that Tharoor’s comments were an attempt to muddy matters before the Supreme Court verdict. “Nobody is forcing the Ram temple, we all want it but we will wait for the verdict of the court to happen. This comment from Shashi Tharoor linking the construction of the temple to the demolition of the disputed structure years ago is yet another attempt to somehow muddy waters at the time that the honorable Supreme Court is likely to take up this issue on a fast track basis.” RSS leader Indresh Kumar was much more vitriolic in his rebukes. Calling Tharoor a ‘mental case’ in an interview with  , Kumar said, “He is neither a Hindu nor a Democrat, he is not secular and doesn't have moral values.” While the ensuing media maelstrom spiralled into greater chaos, Tharoor took to Twitter blasting “the malicious distortion of my words by some media in the service of political masters” and clarifying what he really said and meant. The Congress on Monday, 15 October, distanced itself from its leader Shashi Tharoor’s remarks that no good Hindu would want the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by destroying somebody else’s place of worship, saying he made them in his “personal capacity”. Congress spokesperson RPN Singh said the party believes that the verdict of the Supreme Court on the Ram temple issue will be binding on everyone and the government will have to implement it. “As far as the issue is concerned, we have a clearly stated position. We have stated that this issue is in court and the court will be hearing this issue. Whatever is the verdict, everybody will have to follow the same,” reported PTI. Singh said the Supreme Court verdict will be binding and acceptable to all and the government will have to implement it. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Jamphel Sheyan,"We, the people of Zanskar or Zangskar, a   of the Kargil district, in the eastern half Jammu and Kashmir, have been shouting ‘Hindustan Zindabad’ for the last 70 years every Independence Day – never mind the fact that we haven’t really known ‘true independence’. Each Independence Day, the people from Zanskar and various nearby villages make their way to Padum, which is the administrative headquarters of Zanskar, and celebrate India’s independence in a big way. I doubt whether 15 August carries any historically important significance in their lives but it does not matter as every Independence Day brings momentary joy and happiness. If we look at our history, on this day we got Independence from the British Raj and since then, India has been growing in leaps and bounds to become one of the fastest growing economies of the world. Though India has progressed in many areas, Zanskar has failed to achieve true freedom. It would have been much better if the Government of India had not disturbed Zanskar’s old setting, with its ill-conceived policies. Today, we have roads but I have seen locals and tourists sayings that a trail would have been a better option, where you can have a comfortable walk at least. The present road has made our life more problematic. Now, neither can we afford to walk or ride horses leisurely, nor can we have a comfortable ride without any damage to vehicle or uneasiness among people. It was my grandfather’s dream to have roads; and it saddens me to recall that he could not see a ‘true road’ in his lifetime. All he saw were roads with potholes and mud, where the risk factor was always higher than the happiness of travelling. The mere existence of these systems being in place come handy for politicians and bureaucrats to flaunt their contribution to our society, but those who have visited Zanskar, know the naked truth. Governments have changed but our life has not seen the change it ought to. We are still the underdeveloped, tribal people, but certainly not like our predecessors who had deep trust in the government and policies. Embroiled in this broth of injustice and inequality, I am often reminded of the lines of Ambedkar, who writes, “The question whether the Congress fought for freedom has very little importance as compared to the question for whose freedom Congress fought”. In our case, we seem to be the people for whose freedom neither national parties, nor regional parties have done anything worth appreciating. Whatever development we have seen in Zanskar is in the form of small perks distributed during election season or a few big projects started for their own welfare. We have only one mobile tower which caters to central Zanskar and its adjoining areas. It works only in limited areas where one has to travel solely to have network on one’s phone. I remember how my friend and I had to walk for half an hour just to pass on an important message to Jammu to his brother. But this is a common phenomenon in Zanskar, and I know of many who have lost their jobs and important opportunities primarily because of poor network. There are still many villages in Stodh, Sham and Lungna areas of Zanskar where the only source of communication is a DSPT (Digitial Statelite Phone Terminal). Whenever there is a problem in this phone, villagers have to take it Kargil or Leh for repair, and communication is lost for months. There are around dozens of primary and middle schools, four high schools, one secondary school, and one college. In addition to these government schools, Zanskar has around four private schools up to middle and matriculation standards. Zanskar has the capacity to be a self-sufficient educational hub if the government takes the necessary steps in this direction, which it has not taken till date. Outgoing students from these four government high schools and private schools have to travel outside Zanskar to places like Leh, Kargil, Himachal, Delhi, Chandigarh or Jammu for higher studies due to the unavailability of full-fledged courses and the unavailability of lecturers in the only Higher Secondary School of Zanskar. The same is the fate of graduating students of secondary schools who have to travel outside Zanskar due to the poor infrastructural and low educational standards in the only degree college in Zanskar. The health sector too is in a state of hibernation like other infrastructure development in Zanskar. There is only one community health centre in Padum with only limited facilities for the whole of Zanskar. There are only five doctors, with the posts of various specializations like gynaecology, pediatrics and ENT being vacant for a long time. In their absence, local people have to go to Kargil ,Leh or to Himachal for treatment. Whenever, I am in Zanskar, I feel out of my element: where am I, and where do I belong? These questions crop up in my mind due to this step-motherly treatment from the Jammu and Kashmir government and central government. The biggest reason for this step-motherly treatment is the absence of our own people in the State Assembly. The Assembly constituency is named after Zanskar, but till date, no one from Zanskar has succeeded in holding this seat. From the very beginning, Zanskar has been an independent kingdom with very little or no political connection with Suru Valley which is located on the other side of Juldo. Juldo marks the boundary between Zanskar and Suru Valley. People of Suru Valley never associate themselves with Zanskar except during the assembly elections and in this case, ‘Zanskar’, in the nomenclature of Zanskar Constituency, is their ticket to development. Such political misrepresentation has pushed Zanskar to the lowest level of the receiving end of this apathy, and Suru valley has been progressing at the cost of funds meant for Zanskar. This is the ground reality of Zanskar that people hardly know about. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday, launched a major monthly donation drive for his ‘bankrupt’ Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in New Delhi, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Kejriwal stressed on the need to emulate the financial model of the Left parties, which is driven by donations from party workers and supporters, reported  , He repeatedly said that AAP was a “ ” (bankrupt) party, adding that his government’s honesty had ensured the party’s coffers were not enriched by the exchequer’s money. “There are elections in the next two years. We do not have money. Party needs money. All working volunteers must contribute at least Rs 100 per month. Your family members who earn have to contribute,” the Delhi Chief Minister said while addressing a gathering of around 1,000 party workers, as per the report. He also said that people from across the country can support the campaign by dialling a number – that was also launched at the event. The party invited its supporters to contribute at least Rs 100 per month. “If you want better schools, hospitals and a regular supply of electricity and water then please donate. This is the right way to build the nation,” Kejriwal tweeted. Meanwhile, AAP MLA Sanjay Singh, while addressing the gathering, announced that he will donate Rs 21,000 every month from his salary to the campaign. ""Not just me but my retired father and mother will also donate to the campaign,"" he said. Kejriwal also announced that he will donate Rs 10,000 from his monthly salary.

The Quint,"Through a painful and honest blog published in  , Priya Ramani's husband Samar Halarnkar highlights the courage it took for his wife to name MJ Akbar for his inappropriate behavior at the workplace, the culture of male impunity that stings India's professional lives, and finally, the power of truth that pervades over all else. Halarnkar's point of departure is the normalisation of misuse of power and authority by powerful men. While being aware of his wife's ordeal for about 20 years, he was also cognizant of the fact that complaints of 'inappropriate' behavior were never considered seriously, and nor were the redressal mechanisms within media companies for the same. In all this, as he writes, women stood to lose most from going against men in positions of power. Samar Halarnkar also explains why his wife would no longer remain silent, and that it was both her courage, as well as a strong sense of right and wrong, that helped name a powerful minister and former editor. In between incessant calls from unknown numbers and reporters seeking television appearances, Halarnkar writes about how the couple's silent life has been ""torn asunder.” The consequent result of the defamation suit against his wife, therefore, has resulted in her being the target. Akbar's intention is clear and two pronged, he argues. The first is intimidation via the medium of a defamation lawsuit. In Halarnkar's own words: Second, the use of a defamation suit as a signal from the political establishment that women should be made aware of their limits. He says: Ramani's husband notes the reasons behind the 'menacing' reaction to his wife's account: First, the culture of sexual harassment itself, and second, the maintenance of a patriarchal status quo, which is the reason behind the lack of support from opposition parties as well. A sense of superiority is so ingrained in men, he says, that even women are 'willing accomplices'. Finally, he addresses the #MeToo movement, and how it has opened the space to demonstrate that intimidation is not normal, it must have consequences. In fact, intimidation is the powerful man's strongest weapon, he says. For them (him and his wife), the important weapon is truth, and the courage to fight in the face of power. For this reason, ""the normalcy of unreconstructed men will not return. The women of India will ensure it does not,"" Halarnkar powerfully states. Of course, there is a fear of the costs of naming Akbar, and the effect of it on his family. But as he writes, ""that fear must now end."" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Sudheendra Kulkarni,"Here is a book that has sold 1.1 million copies in less than a month since its release on 7/11, making it one of the fastest selling books in the world. And it is by an author, Bob Woodward, who, as one of America’s most famous investigative journalists, has covered nine presidencies ─ from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump. His first book  , co-authored with his   colleague Carl Bernstein, chronicled the Watergate Scandal, which became Nixon’s ‘Waterloo’. The very likelihood of Trump winning a renewed mandate is one of the things the world fears about America. Americans opposed to him not only fear, but positively dread the prospect, as I found out in my recent travels in that country. But another ‘F’ word made me fear for America, as I finished reading this book non-stop, during my non-stop Air India flight from New York. His senior colleagues in the White House too use it routinely in their own conversations and on a few occasions ─ and this is absolutely unthinkable in the Indian context ─ also while talking to their boss. It’s as if sexism and profanity have become mainstream in the highest echelons of Trumpian administration. Purity of thoughts, feelings, words and deeds ─ this is Mahatma Gandhi’s true meaning of ‘ ’ (cleanliness), which he said was indistinguishable from, and a precondition for,   (nonviolence). Use of dirty and abusive words, particularly those with sexist connotations, is frowned upon. Not all our public figures are paragons of (this) virtue, but most of them know that they cannot get away by speaking obscene language openly. Sadly, these cultural and societal constraints seem to have disappeared from the world’s richest democracy. Candidate Trump had weathered the storm when, during the last stages of the 2016 campaign, the media had exposed his infamous boast about sexually assaulting women. (“When you are a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p***y.”) In a half-hearted apology, he had belittled it as “locker-room talk”. But old habits die hard. For example, Trump calls Obama, whom he loves to hate, “a weak d**k”. No wonder, Steve Bannon, who served as his ideologue and ‘chief strategist’ in the White House, thinks nothing of saying this about the president’s first chief of staff in the White House: “I reached out and sucked Reince Preibus’s d**k”. Later, when Bannon’s presence in Trump’s White House became too toxic (mainly because he clashed with Trump’s daughter Ivanka and all-powerful son-in-law Jared Kushner), Trump told his senior staff, “I just fired Bannon... m*therf**er.” Since no member in Trump’s team has any respect for the other, including for the president himself, we read H R McMaster, who was the national security advisor until he was fired, describing Trump himself as “a pr**k”. In an important discussion on trade (in which Trump dogmatically insisted on taking USA along the path of protectionism), Gary Cohn, chairman of the national economic advisory council, shouts at Trump: “If you just shut the f**k up and listen, you might learn something.” Woodward gives a blow-by-blow account of a top-secret meeting in the Pentagon’s “secure room”, in which Trump attacks America’s top generals in front of his entire team of senior White House officials. When he is gone, Rex Tillerson, his own secretary of state (subsequently fired unceremoniously), says, “He (President) is a moron”, and he says it in a way so “everyone” in the room can hear. Later, he repeats the same to Preibus, the chief of staff, “I just don’t like the way the president talks to these generals. I can’t sit around and listen to this from the president. He’s just a moron.”  About his exit, he comments, “The president has zero ability to recognise empathy in any way.” As staff leader, Preibus attempted ─ and failed ─ to bring some order to the White House that was perennially in-fighting. When he left, he lamented, “When you put a snake and rat and a falcon and rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody.” Addressing “a small group meeting in his office one day”, Kelley says this of Trump, “He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in crazytown. I don’t know why any of us is here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.” And what about Jim Mattis, the defence secretary who recently came to New Delhi, along with Mike Pompeo (who succeeded Tillerson as the secretary of state), for the “2+2” meeting with their counterparts Nirmala Sitharaman and Sushma Swaraj? Another retired Marine General, who is widely read, is regarded as the only “adult” in the White House. After a discussion Trump had with his top aides, in which he repeatedly rebuffed them on trade, foreign and military policies, “Mattis was particularly exasperated and alarmed, telling close associates that the president acted like ─ and had the understanding of ─ ‘a fifth or sixth grader’.” According to US media reports, differences between Mattis and Trump have reached a breaking point, and he too might quit soon. In a conversation about Robert Mueller and his team who are investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election (to favour Trump), he is quoted as telling them, “Go f**k themselves.” When he orders the bombing of Syria, he says about its president Bashir al-Assad, “Let’s f**k*ng kill him. Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f**k*ng lot of them.” Trump’s racism and Islamophobia are well-known, and have defined his policy of severely limiting immigration into America. The book quotes him as saying that USA should not allow immigrants from “shit-hole countries”. However, in the same breath, this supporter of white supremacists also says that he has no objection to more people like “Norwegians” coming to America. For a leader ─ any leader ─ political or otherwise ─ to be effective, he or she must command at least a modicum of respect from their staff. And the leader too must behave with their staff in a decent, if not respectful, way. But this is not how it’s working in Trump’s White House. Here, the rule-breaker is the president himself. To staff secretary Rob Porter, Trump says os Preibus (chief of staff and hence Porter’s immediate boss), “He’s like a little rat, he just scurries around. You don’t even have to pay attention to him. Just come talk to me.” Cohn, who was president of Goldman Sachs before he joined Trump’s team, quit in protest when Trump decided to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. (He fell victim to the ‘Americanism vs Globalism’ battle that Trump has launched.) When Cohn was a free man, this is how he described the American president: “He’s a professional liar.” The book ends with a remark attributed to John Dowd, who quit as Trump’s personal lawyer defending him before Mueller: “You’re a f*ck*ng liar.” Does Trump fear himself? And what’ll be the consequence of Trump challenging America’s “establishment”? Of course, a leader should not be judged solely on the basis of obscenities in his language. History has known tyrants and war-mongers who spoke chaste words. Also, all leaders are human and, therefore, imperfect in some way or the other. The question is: Why is Trump the way he is? A more important question is: What might happen to Trump and America? In a March 2016 interview Trump gave to the author (well before the presidential election), he said, “Real power is ─  ─ fear.” Trump’s way of exercising power is by instilling fear in others. But the more one psychologically reads about him ─ his misogyny, his bigotry, his bullying, his constant attempt to use others (including his colleagues) for his own purpose and discard them when they are useless, his failure to study complex issues and pay attention to diverse viewpoints, his lack of higher education, his lack of record of service, his long and by-now-well-documented record of law-breaking, and his firm conviction that he can win elections and rule America only by polarising American society ─ the more one is convinced that he himself is a victim of fear. No wonder, almost his entire White House staff has quit ─ they’ve resigned or he has fired them ─ within two years of his incumbency. The answer to the second question ─ What might happen to Trump and America? ─ needs some speculation and extrapolation from the narrative in Woodward’s book. Trump is, in some, not all ways, an anti-establishment politician. He wants to withdraw completely from the unwinnable 17-year-old war in Afghanistan (which is a good thing). He thinks this money (also money he thinks he can get by increasing tariffs on imports from China and other countries) can be used for modernising America’s crumbling infrastructure and rebuilding its shrunken manufacturing base. USA’s GDP (nearly USD 20 trillion) may be the highest in the world, but its infrastructure (railways, highways, ports and airports) are no match to China’s. Even the Delhi airport is much better than New York’s JFK. On page 226, Woodward writes, quoting a senior White House official: “The president proceeded to lecture and insult the entire group about how they didn’t know anything when it came to defense or national security. It seems clear that many of the president’s senior advisers, especially in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views.” Does this mean Trump is challenging and is disconnected with America’s ‘Deep State’? If so, he might get into serious trouble, irrespective of, and in addition to, the likely trouble from Mueller’s probe into his ─ and his team members’ ─ election-time irregularities. Another JFK? But this may not happen. For, Trump is quite capable of going back on his position just to stay in power. “I am always moving,” he said in one of his media interviews. “I’m moving in both directions.”       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Two Goa Congress legislators, Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar, on Tuesday, 16 October, announced that they have shifted their allegiance and joined the BJP, ANI reported. Speaking to ANI, Subhash Shirodkar said: The duo had left for Delhi on Monday, 15 October, amid speculations that they were headed to meet BJP president Amit Shah to join the party, officially. “Both the Congress MLAs will be resigning from the Congress party on Tuesday and joining the BJP,” a senior BJP leader had told PTI, earlier on in the day. While Sopte, who defeated former BJP chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar in 2017 state legislative assembly election, represents Mandrem constituency, Shirodkar was elected on a Congress ticket from Shiroda constituency. Both the legislators had left by a midnight flight to Delhi. Goa Health Minister and BJP MLA Vishwajit Rane also left for Delhi, a little before their departure. “I am going on a business trip,” Sopte had told reporters at the airport. Similarly, when Shirodkar was asked whether he was joining the BJP, he had responded, “You will come to know, if I do it.” Goa is currently witnessing hectic political activities with the Congress party petitioning President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention to ask Goa Governor Mridula Sinha to call them to form the government. The BJP state core committee and legislature party also met in Panaji during the day.

The Quint,"Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar on Tuesday, 16 October, appointed Prashant Kishor as the party's vice president, effectively making him the second most powerful person in the party. Kishor, who has worked for a number of parties as a poll strategist, joined the ruling party in Bihar a month ago on 16 September. He is seen to be close to Kumar, the state's chief minister. Party spokesperson KC Tyagi said Kishor's appointment will help it reach out to social segments out of its traditional support base. Kishor took his oath administered by party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Patna in October. Tweeting ahead of the ceremony, Kishor had said, Referring to Kishor’s joining, JD(U) leader, RCP Singh told ANI: “If someone is a poll strategist, he understands polls very well. He is not new. We are happy that he joined us. There is a difference between other parties and us. If you want to work in JD(U), then sky is the limit. He will strengthen our working.” According to several media reports, Kishor has a few tasks up his sleeve, once he makes his foray into politics with the JD(U). reports that one of the first tasks he will most likely handle will be to broker peace between the JD(U) and the BJP. Kishor was both Kumar and Modi’s campaign manager in the 2015 Bihar assembly election and the 2014 Lok Sabha election respectively, helping both parties clinch victories. The article also notes that should the JD(U) decide to jump on to the RJD bandwagon, Kishor’s amicable relations with Lalu Yadav and family will be beneficial. Apart from helping both BJP and JD(U), Kishor also assisted Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh secure a victory against the AAP, by shaping his election campaign as well. However, his association with the Congress did not last long, and the party lost the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand elections, despite him overseeing the campaign. While there were speculations over Kishor’s foray into politics, he recently ruled out the Congress as an option when at an event in Hyderabad he reportedly said: “Rahul (Gandhi) and I are not on the same page.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"Realising its dream of electoral victories in the country’s only Muslim-majority State, which shattered in the Assembly elections in 2014, the BJP is confident to independently control 14 of the 40 urban local bodies. Though the BJP had bagged 25 out of 37 seats in the Assembly elections in Jammu division, it failed to win a single seat out of 46 in the Valley. BJP President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ambitiously named it ‘Mission-44 Plus’. Thanks to the boycotting of the current municipal elections by separatists and both the mainstream political majors, — National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — the BJP is determined to install its chairpersons in 13 ULBs besides “our own mayor” in the capital city of Srinagar. “We are directly contesting on 67 seats out of 74 wards in Srinagar. We are also supporting 3 independent candidates. With the help of these three independent candidates, we are sure to win absolute majority and elect our own mayor in Srinagar for the first time in history,” BJP’s overall in-charge of ULBs in Kashmir, Maulvi Tariq, told  . Once the ‘commander-in-chief’ of militant group Hizbullah, Maulvi Tariq had contested and won the 2005 ULB elections from Bemina in Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) on NC’s ticket. A few years back, he joined the BJP. Asked if the three BJP-supported independent candidates included a youth leader, who has lately resigned from NC and is contesting simultaneously on four seats, Maulvi Tariq said: When it was pointed out to Maulvi Tariq that even Governor Satya Paul Malik had lately speculated about a foreign-educated youth leader’s emergence as a potential candidate for mayor in Srinagar, he asserted that Raj Bhawan had issued a clarification. “That was blown out of proportion by media,” he said. “It’s not His Excellency Governor or anybody sitting in Delhi who will decide Srinagar’s next mayor. It’s the people who vote and their elected councillors who will decide. Our real contest is with the Congress, besides some proxy candidates of the NC and PDP,” Tariq said. “But the BJP has strategised well and we are getting majority not only in Srinagar, but also in Pahalgam, Devsar, Seer Hamadan, Shopian and Kulgam in South, Srinagar, Budgam and Magam in Central Kashmir and Sumbal, Pattan, Bandipora, Sopore, Handwara and Kupwara in North,” Tariq asserted. He claimed that the BJP had no alliance with any political party or proxy in Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP leader revealed that out of 598 wards in 40 ULBs in Kashmir, his party had fielded its own candidates in over 260 wards. Dispelling the impression that most of the BJP’s candidates were either former militants or illiterate activists, Maulvi Tariq said many of his candidates were “much more qualified that the foreign-educated youths being discussed in certain quarters”. “We are a highly qualified brigade. I have Masters in Science. Our Budgam district ULB incharge (Ghulam Mohammad Paul) is a retired professor. Professor Khizar Mohammad is our candidate from Noorbagh. Incharge of our grievance cell Dr Rafi and our woman leader Darakhshan Andrabi are PhDs”, he said. BJP’s district president for Budgam, Ghulam Hassan Khan Babar, who also headed a militant organisation before joining Jammu and Kashmir Youth Congress in 1996, said the party high command had for the first time shown total faith and confidence in the State cadre and left all decisions related to the municipal election to Maulvi Tariq and his local team. “Unfortunately some of our senior leaders breached our trust. Some of them manipulated our candidates’ defeat in Anantnag, Dooru and other places. Some of them failed to motivate a single candidate in the municipal bodies they had taken charge of,” Khan, nonetheless, complained. “But thank God, all of our District Presidents worked hard. They contributed candidates to almost all the bodies and ensured their victory. We have conveyed to our State and Central leadership that no decision, no individual should be imposed upon our cadre. We will resign   if we will be forced to elect any such person as chairman or mayor who has not contested on our ticket or has not formally joined BJP,” Khan said. “We are campaigning and contesting in the most challenging circumstances. We have risked our life and properties. People whisper that our candidates have got Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh each for contesting this election,” Khan told  . “As a matter of fact, only in Srinagar our candidates have got Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000 each for campaigning besides Rs 2,000 as security deposit. In rural areas, only the candidates in polling wards have got Rs 10,000 each,” Khan pointed out. “Others have got nothing other than Rs 500 or Rs 1000 as security deposit in the nomination. One of our lady candidates in Srinagar disposed of her gold ornaments worth Rs 40,000 to contest this election. We have no other support from party or any other quarter,” Khan explained. The BJP District chief pointed out how his party cadre had mobilised candidates in the Valley’s militant-infested and most turbulent districts of Shopian, Kulgam, Pulwama and Anantnag. “Even after a number of our workers were gunned down in the last one or two years in South Kashmir, our Shopian District President Javed Qadri managed to field all 13 candidates in Shopian. They got elected uncontested. We arranged for 8 candidates out of 13 wards in Devsar. No other party was able to get a candidate there,” Khan said. Due to single or no candidates, polling could not be held in over two dozen ULBs in the Valley. Of the 598 wards in 40 UBLs, polling was physically held only in 178 wards. While nobody filed nomination in as many as 184 wards, there were single candidates in 236 wards. With the fourth and the final phase of polling being held on Tuesday, 16 October, in 36 wards in Srinagar and Ganderbal, the Valley has recorded the history’s lowest ever voter turnout of 6.7 per cent in the first three phases.

PTI,"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor kicked up a political row with his remarks on Sunday, 14 October, when he said that no ""good"" Hindu would favour a Ram temple in Ayodhya by demolishing somebody else's place of worship. Tharoor, the MP from Thiruvananthapuram, had made the comments at an event in Chennai on Sunday. ""As a Hindu, obviously, I am conscious that a vast majority of my fellow Hindus believe that that (disputed site in Ayodhya) was the specific birthplace of Ram. For this reason, most good Hindus would want to see a Ram temple at the site where Ram was supposed to be born,” Tharoor had said. The BJP hit back at Tharoor over his remarks, with the party's national spokesman Sambit Patra saying that the statement ""exposed"" the real face of Gandhi. ""Rahul Gandhi's real face stands exposed,"" Patra told a tv news channel, criticising Tharoor's comments. He made a reference to the Congress president's frequent visits to temples in election-bound states. Meanwhile, Tharoor insisted that his comments were personal and not those of his party. His remarks, Tharoor insisted, were ‘distorted’ out of malice. ""I was asked for my personal opinion at a literary festival and gave it as such. I am not a spokesperson for my party and did not claim to be speaking for Congress,"" he tweeted. ""I condemn the malicious distortion of my words by some media in the service of political masters. I had said, ‘most Hindus would want a temple at what they believe to be Ram’s birthplace. But no good Hindu would want it to be built by destroying another’s place of worship’,’’ he added. ""He is no authority on Hinduism. He has led a life which has nothing to do with Hinduism. He is arrogating to himself spiritual powers or powers of religious authority. He has lost his balance,"" Swamy said. Tharoor had sparked off a similar controversy in July with comments that if the BJP was voted to power again, it will rewrite the Constitution that will eventually create a ""Hindu Pakistan"". At that event in Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor had said, ""If they are able to win a repeat of their current strength in the Lok Sabha then, frankly, our own democratic Constitution, as we understand [it], will not survive... because then they will have all the three elements they need to tear up the Constitution of India and write a new one."" ""And that will enshrine the principle of Hindu Rashtra, that will remove equality for the minorities, and that will create a Hindu Pakistan... and that is not what Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad and great heroes of freedom struggle fought for,"" he had noted.

Vakasha Sachdev,"A day after finally breaking his silence on the allegations of sexual harassment and assault against him, MJ Akbar has now filed a complaint against Priya Ramani, the first woman to publicly call him out, for criminal defamation under Section 500 of the IPC. The 41-page complaint was filed at the Patiala House District Court on his behalf by the law firm Karanjawala & Co, and argues that Ramani “willfully, deliberately, intentionally and maliciously” defamed Akbar on “wholly and completely false, frivolous, unjustifiable and scandalous grounds”. It goes on to say that Ramani’s articles and tweets, and the subsequent articles in India and abroad, have harmed the “goodwill and reputation” of Akbar, “within the political fraternity, media, friends, family, colleagues and in society at large.” Ramani has responded with a statement of her own, terming the defamation case an attempt by Akbar to silence the women who have made serious allegations against him “through intimidation and harassment”, and vowed to fight the defamation case. Here’s what the complaint says, and what the key legal issues that the case will need to address are. Criminal defamation is defined in Section 499 of the IPC as making or publishing an imputation about a person which is intended to harm the reputation of that person (or which the person making it knows or believes will harm the person’s reputation). The complaint first sets out the details of Akbar’s career, including his current status as a politician, his time as an eminent journalist, and as an author of several books. This is done to establish his reputation in public life, which will be important to establishing that his reputation has been harmed. It then lists the articles and tweets that allegedly defame Akbar. These include Ramani’s October 2017 article in Vogue India (in which she didn’t actually name Akbar, addressing a “Male Boss” instead), tweets by her which identify Akbar as the subject of her piece and note the other women who have come forward to expose him as a “sexual predator” and articles in the  , Mint and Firstpost which repeat her allegations against Akbar. The complaint then focuses on one of Ramani’s own tweets, in which she had said that she didn’t name Akbar in the Vogue article “because he didn’t ‘do’ anything.” This is used to say that Ramani has herself admitted that Akbar never did anything to her, thereby demonstrating that she has “intentionally put forward malicious, fabricated and salacious imputations” to harm his reputation. Akbar’s complaint goes on to argue that the Ramani’s false narrative is being circulated in a motivated manner to fulfill an agenda, though he does not clarify what this is. Next, the complaint tries to establish the harm caused to Akbar’s reputation by Ramani, noting the effect on his personal reputation among friends, family and colleagues, as well as in the eyes of the public and the political fraternity. It tries to back this up on the basis that Akbar has received numerous calls from friends and colleagues from the media and politics. Akbar’s complaint also includes a list of witnesses, whose testimony he intends to use as evidence to prove his case. These include Joyeeta Basu (Editor of the Sunday Guardian), Veenu Sandal (the Asian Age tarot reader mentioned in Ghazala Wahab’s account of harassment by Akbar), and author Sunil Gujral. Ramani has indicated that she will be arguing that what she’s said is true, and therefore not defamatory. In criminal defamation cases, truth is a defence,   the public good requires the statement or imputation to be made. Given Akbar’s status as a Minister of State and his standing in the journalism community, bringing these allegations to light would certainly satisfy the test of public good. Ramani’s statements about Akbar include her personal experience of how he conducted her interview and the way in which he has allegedly treated other young women (in the Vogue article) and her reference to him as a predator in her tweets (including the one listing all the women who have come forward). She can claim that these statements were not defamatory on two grounds: truth and the expression of an opinion in good faith. Her statement about how he conducted her interview needs no further evidence beyond her own testimony,  and the women who have come forward against Akbar are also likely to stand by their accounts, even in court if necessary.  One area which may prove controversial is with regard to the lines Ramani claims Akbar would use on new women at the office every year. These are in quotation marks, and so unless these were used against her (which doesn’t appear to be the case), she may need to get some of those women to whom these were said to testify that Akbar had said them. With regard to her statements that he is a predator, she would  (though it is likely that Akbar may try to argue this regarding incidents before the   judgment in 1997). In light of what she knew of his conduct and the testimonies of others, she should be able to rely on the exception to defamation of expressing an opinion in good faith “respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question, and respecting his character”.  It should be noted that Akbar has not denied any of the allegations made by Ramani per se, whether in her article in Vogue, or with reference to the claims of other women. The only way in which he has tried to indicate that her allegations are false is by saying that she herself has admitted that he didn’t “do” anything to her. The value of relying on this argument is dubious since Ramani clearly uses the word ‘do’ in double quotes and it appears reasonably clear from her tweet that she is talking about the problematic way in which sexual harassment is viewed, rather than admitting (in legal terms) that Akbar didn’t actually do anything to her. Although Akbar has not filed the complaint against the other women who have made allegations against him, the fact that he has taken issue with tweets referencing them could mean that even they can take the stand to indicate Ramani was speaking the truth and that her statements were in good faith. The Patiala House District Court will now decide whether or not to take cognisance of the complaint. This will need to factor in whether or not it has jurisdiction (which the judge will probably agree to), as well as whether or not the complaint prima facie discloses a criminal offence. To conduct this assessment, it can examine the complainant and any witnesses it feels necessary. Akbar has approached the court armed with a big law firm in Karanjawala & Co – though it should be noted that the comments regarding him hiring 97 lawyers on social media are an exaggeration (the names of the entire firm are only listed on the vakalatnama at the end of the complaint for convenience, not because they will all necessarily be representing Akbar). For Ramani, social media is already awash with offers to crowdfund her defence, and several high-profile lawyers have expressed a willingness to help prepare her defence. These include renowned women lawyers like India Jaising, Rebecca John and Vrinda Grover, who have publicly expressed their support for her. If the court decides to take cognizance of the complaint, the trial will proceed with arguments likely to revolve around the issues discussed above. While the proceedings are ongoing, we are also likely to see attempts by Akbar to have reporting on the allegations against him to be injuncted. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Syed Ata Hasnain,"A prominent visual media channel has revealed through a video story that almost 14 incursions by the China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have occurred recently in the Ladakh sector in just two weeks, with four additional incursions across the Indo-Tibet border in Uttarakhand. However, what is important is that six months after the reset process in Sino-Indian relations was triggered at Wuhan in April 2018, the Chinese have decided to once again robustly establish their claims. In the interim, there has been a contestation of perceptions within India on whether the PLA’s Doklam infrastructure construction and troops deployment has offensive content or not. It is also important to note that the transgressions were happening even as the 2+2 dialogue between India and the US was underway, and the follow-up diplomacy to that was in progress. While complimenting the media channel for having focused on the issue which has largely gone unreported, it is important to take an analytical view of the same to determine the ‘why and what next’ of these transgressions in the rapidly altering international strategic environment. Most of my post-Doklam assessments clearly focused on telling a few ‘stories’ which are important to briefly recall. The Indian Navy, the crucial entity which enables this balance, can also upset it. It competes with the Indian Army for resources from the pie of the national exchequer for expansion and modernisation. To prevent upsetting the power balance, China’s strategy aims at focusing India’s attention on the security of the Himalayan front and the western borders with Pakistan. This ensures that the bigger chunk of the Indian strategic resources go there, and psychologically, India’s policy planners are forced to focus on the apparent inherent dangers in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Interestingly since the 1967 Nathula incident which led to large-scale casualties on both sides, not a shot has been exchanged between the two armies. It is actually simultaneously admirable and laughable that in mid August 2017, patrols of the two sides in the Pangong Tso sub sector, actually engaged in throwing stones at each other. Thus, while transgressions have been ongoing intermittently, there has been a total restraint on mindless violence. So how does this activity help the Chinese besides keeping Himalayan claims alive? The video analysis spoke of keeping Sino-Indian and India-Pakistan borders on the boil; that would happen if there was persistence in deployment and a display of resolve to hold ground against all odds, alongside the exchange of fire. Another of the issues highlighted has been the potential needling of the Modi government to show it in poor light, and reduce its chances of re-election. Unless there is a major embarrassment on the border, no government in India is going to feel electoral pressure. In fact transgressions actually help the government of the day to project its own muscular capability. Doklam gave the Modi government far greater self-confidence in dealing with the northern borders. If the intention was to draw attention away from Doklam as some have conjectured, it must be remembered that the reinforced Doklam deployment is right under the nose of Indian troops. It is no tactical deployment which will assist in any war fighting effort. It is simply intimidation of non-military minds. At best, what the PLA was attempting to do with the recent transgressions was making up numbers in terms of activity after a reasonably quiet period. Every analyst had concluded that there would be many more Doklams to keep claims alive and intimidate India and its army, especially since during the actual 72-day-long Doklam standoff, the PLA did not exactly cover itself with glory. October is the best month to do this before the winter sets in and these areas become impassable. Most of all, what observers need to remember is that the Chinese intent is clear – to keep the border issue alive; it helps in intimidation and prevents India balancing its land and maritime strategies. The dilution of India’s commitment to the quad of nations was a result of this strategy. A total Indian commitment to US interests still remains elusive; it is all the effect of the China factor; walk-ins and Doklams ensure that.         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Smruti Koppikar,"This was in the early 1990s in the newsroom of India’s most happening newspaper, a publication I was thrilled to be working for as a young reporter. Our chief reporter and I decided to step out for lunch together as we were to carry on a discussion about one of my stories. Two colleagues were to join us for the meal at a then-famous Udupi place in south Bombay, a few blocks away from our office. As the chief reporter and I waited for them at the entrance, a senior editor walked in. She was someone I admired for her writing, her stand on social issues, and her commitment to covering gender and minority-related issues. Seeing us, she casually walked up to our table and asked him what was up. The chief reporter asked if she would like to join us. The senior woman editor sized me up, winked at him, and said to me, “So this is payback for the front page by-line you got today? But just a lunch, nothing later?” The chief reporter guffawed. I froze. She had made the many front-page by-lines I had legitimately earned, cheap. The lunch went by in a blur, the food seemed tasteless, her innuendo-filled words replaying in my head. How, just how, could a senior woman journalist like herself say this to a young woman journalist? I then remembered how once, while at the office canteen with the chief reporter and news editor who were discussing how they liked their “fruits (women) tender and young” – she hadn’t rebuked them. In both cases, wasn’t she enabling and advancing the sexism she professed to take down? Her words have stayed with me for 27 years. Their viciousness, misogyny and coarseness resurfaced twice yesterday – once as I took in Ghazala Wahab’s gut-wrenching account of bravely warding off the then senior editor MJ Akbar’s advances, and the second time as I read editor Seema Mustafa’s attempted take-down of the #MeToo movement in her article titled “Whoa #MeToo, Hold Your Horses”. Women in senior positions in newsrooms can choose to be many things to the younger women and men around them: mentors who guide, show, teach the skills that J-schools cannot, be friends or agony aunts to some who need it, influencers who set the tone and tenor of newsrooms by legitimising (or de-legitimising) words and actions, leaders who can tell off men in senior positions who cross the line and “take their chances” with younger women. When they choose to be silent around men who normalise misogyny and patriarchy, or join in the sexual references, they enable the men. This is   okay. In her account in  , Wahab recalls the harrowing six months of 1997 at  newspaper which she had joined in 1994 and had somehow, until then, managed to escape Akbar’s eye. She details the sexual harassment, the manoeuvres that a man her father’s age carried out just for his cheap thrills, and how hard she fought against them while trying to keep her dream job in a big city. Wahab makes a reference to Seema Mustafa, the bureau chief at the time, whom she had specifically approached at the time, after facing repeated assault and trauma. Wahab recounts in  , “I went into her (Mustafa’s) cubicle and narrated my story. She heard me. She was not surprised. She said that the call was entirely mine; that I should decide what I wanted to do. This was 1997. I was alone, helpless and extremely frightened.” Akbar has not responded to  ’s article or Wahab’s allegations, or those made by (multiple) other women. Calls for his resignation or sacking gathered momentum even among the Opposition. The BJP chose to say little. After all, what could BJP leaders say about Akbar given that several predators continue to be in positions of power? But this is about the enablers or passive offenders. Mustafa was clearly aware of Akbar’s predilections and predatory behaviour in that newsroom, as she clearly states in her  When Wahab approached her to narrate her trauma, she was “not surprised”. But neither did Mustafa take a stand against Akbar’s abusive behaviour, nor did she guide Wahab in the right direction or offer her relief. She essentially left Wahab to fend for herself. Of course, there was no law against sexual harassment, leave alone the language or the context we have today. All that young women journalists had was their bewilderment, trauma, and anger in the face of such harassment. Even now, when awareness is at its peak and the legal mechanism exists, the leadership on sexual harassment cases ought to come from editorial heads; HR can follow the lead. It is, indeed a bit rich of Mustafa to try to marginalise and question the #MeToo movement. “My problem is that the (#MeToo) movement is too subjective; it is arbitrary. It has no responsibility...,” Mustafa writes. She goes on to write, “… where is the inquiry, where is the evidence, where is all that as journalists we require before we even publish a story?” Sure, some women have attempted to ride on the #MeToo train with superfluous complaints or consensual relationships gone sour, but the timeline of the last week shows us that these instances form a minuscule chunk of the larger movement. By and large, women who have faced extreme levels of sexual harassment and predatory behaviour at the workplace have told their stories with great courage and sensitivity. And this narrative to which each story has added a layer, has led to two things. First, it has prompted offenders to come out and apologise in the public domain. The likes of actor Rajat Kapoor, author Chetan Bhagat, and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap have tweeted their apologies. Does Mustafa still want to wait for evidence after men have accepted their guilt? His three decades of predatory behaviour has been   called out. But that is pillorying Akbar? Second, there have been real-time, real-world direct consequences for the offenders. There is now an FIR against Nana Patekar and others accused by actress Tanushree Dutta, companies have dissolved, jobs have been lost. Is this not a movement of substance still? Those like Mustafa (whose work from rural areas has indeed been commendable), journalists Madhu Kishwar, Tavleen Singh who called for a “real Indian MeToo movement for women who don’t speak English”, and politician Jaya Jaitly who lamented that “the present MeToo is still among the privileged classes and urban”, may want to take note of the consequences that the movement has already had. Sure, it is not all-inclusive yet, it has not yet substantially cut across intersections of urban-rural, English-vernacular, privileged castes-oppressed castes, and so on. But are these grounds for belittling and dismissing this important movement? Isn’t there a false binary here, all you worthy women? This movement does not have to be an either-or. It is a relatively organic movement against abuse, assault, harassment and other violations against women at their workplaces and beyond. It is a  movement. Yes, it could have been less ageist, less classist, less parochial. It can – and should – include other categories of women, but let’s not belittle what our #MeToo has achieved. It has courageously unveiled the silence around sexual harassment, especially in workplaces, exposed the ‘bro-hood’ camaraderie among predatory and “woke” men, and a call to take the law on sexual harassment more seriously than it has been. To Mustafa and other women I have to say – instead of picking on the movement which has made sexual harassment a significant conversation of our times, you could perhaps pose questions to powerful women in the Union Cabinet like Sushma Swaraj on their silence around the #MeToo movement and allegations against their colleague. Your silence, your inaction, your unwillingness to use your formidable voices enables men like Akbar. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Kishor, who recently joined Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) – thus ending speculations of assisting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party in the upcoming polls – was making his first public appearance since then. “If elections were to happen today”, Kishor said, “BJP is in the lead”. “Approval ratings indicate people might not be as euphoric as they were in 2014 for BJP but they're still there. It doesn’t matter who I think will win because at the end of the day, what the majority believes is right,” Kishor said. Having worked with both PM Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Kishor said there was a difference between both leaders. “While Modi is a big risk taker and exhibits courage, Rahul is more status-quo-ist. For example, before  episode was going live, we were scared because the campaign was going well. Other leaders would have been far more cautious but Modi wasn’t. Rahul is more status-quo-ist. He resorts to conventional ways,” Kishor said. Kishor also said that it too soon to write Rahul Gandhi off as he has just taken over the reins of the party. “I think Rahul is the right guy to lead Congress. Writing him off won't work. We will have to give him 4-5 years before writing him off as a Congress chief,” Kishor said. While listing the schemes that the BJP-led government can capitalise on for the upcoming general elections, Kishor said that the party could have done without demonetisation. ""I think they (BJP) could have done without demonetisation,"" he said. First among the allies of the ruling party to speak against cabinet minister MJ Akbar – accused of sexual harassment by at least 10 women journalists – Kishor said that Akbar should take the onus and step down. Kishor further said that he arrived at his decision to join JD(U) despite several proposals from the BJP to join the party. “There was an active discussion for me joining and campaigning for the BJP and the NDA in 2019. However, you join the party you want to join, and I could have joined the BJP. The discussion has not ended. It is on and off,” Kishor said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Taha Siddiqui ,"On Monday, journalist Cyril Almeida who is with Pakistan’s leading English daily  appeared before the high court in Lahore city in a treason case, along with Pakistan’s two former Prime Ministers, namely Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who both held the office in the last government. The first two, ie Almeida and Sharif have been accused of sedition over an interview conducted by the journalist of the former prime minister, which the petitioner said defamed state institutions (read: the Pakistan Army). Abbasi is accused of violating the oath of his office by sharing details of a National Security Council meeting with Sharif. The meeting had discussed the publishing of the above-mentioned interview. The court had earlier ordered the Almeida’s arrest and placed his name on an Exit Control List that forbade him from leaving Pakistan, but reversed the decision on 8 October. The hearing has been adjourned until 22 October and Almeida has been asked to reappear in person again before the court, while Pakistan's Attorney General has been asked to present a report on the matter, so that the courts can decide further action against the three individuals. Pakistan’s mainstream media has been facing an invisible and visible onslaught since the last few years from the Pakistan Army, but many had thought that the military was doing that to ensure that the media did not highlight the institution’s rigging efforts to bring Imran Khan, Pakistan’s current prime minister into office. One of Pakistan’s leading news channels   was one of the first to be forced to reconsider its editorial policy when it started to disappear from cable networks around the country earlier this year.   was critical not only of the military but of Khan, and was considered pro-Sharif prior to the general elections held in July, a few months ago.  distribution network was disrupted, causing it huge financial losses, and it was reportedly forced to make a deal with the military to come back on air. The military has also been accused of being involved in the kidnappings of and attacks on journalists, and we saw many such cases leading up to the elections. But this was all before the elections, and many thought that things will become calmer once the elections are over. While the notion of not allowing certain topics to be discussed is altogether wrong and should not happen in any democratic setup (that Pakistan claims itself to be), the issue becomes graver when there is no clear outline of what is allowed and what is not allowed. For example, in Almeida’s case – how can printing an interview of a former prime minister be deemed as treason? That is why many Pakistani journalists feel that the issue is not about the said interview or about the former PM alone. But  newspaper, founded by the country’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah, has resisted this remodeling to a large extent. And this pursuit of independence has cost them. Not only is one of their journalists being hounded by the courts through a frivolous petition, the military has also been accused of disrupting the paper’s supply, and reports suggest that it has even asked advertising companies to stop providing it with ad revenue, so as to financially strangle it too. Earlier, there was some hope that media could push back against this pressure, given that the elected government was not supporting the military in its pursuit to silence the press. But now that the new government is playing the role of second fiddle to the army, the judiciary also seems supportive of such censorship. While the roles of the new government and the judiciary have been disappointing, the Pakistani media industry itself is also partly responsible for the troubles being faced by news practitioners. Even with Almeida’s treason case, while many of the media blacked out the news altogether, others justified these actions saying that the newspaper was a threat to national security. While primarily such news organisations' editorial policies emanate from military diktat, they also are motivated by the idea that it is fair game to do this to competitors in the market. However, the recent announcement by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists for a nationwide protest on 9 October against curbs on press freedom is a welcome step. One can only hope that Pakistani journalists and more importantly the news organisations they work for realise that the only way to beat the “invisible forces” silencing them today is to fight back with a united front.

Arati R Jerath,"Of the five states going to polls in November-December, Madhya Pradesh may well prove to be a bellwether of the BJP’s fortunes in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Although assembly results are not always accurate indicators of the national mood, the MP campaign seems to have become a testing ground for the big battle ahead, making it the most keenly-watched of all the state contests. There are four reasons as to why the verdict from central India is pivotal to Narendra Modi’s hopes for a second term as prime minister. Five years ago, the BJP’s sweeping victories in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh created the groundswell for Modi’s triumph in the general elections six months later. This time, the BJP has put all its eggs in the MP basket in the belief that even if it loses the other two states, a victory in MP will give momentum to its 2019 campaign. It is curious that BJP leaders have virtually given up on Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, almost as if winning these states are not important milestones on the road to 2019. Chhattisgarh, with just 11 seats in the Lok Sabha, seems to be too small to matter. In any case, the vote share difference between the BJP and the Congress here is less than 1 percent, making the latter a strong contender for power after 15 years of Raman Singh as chief minister. It is difficult to say whether Vasundhara Raje is more unpopular with voters or with her own party leaders and workers. The anger among large sections of the BJP is matched only by the upsurge against her from within the local RSS network. A Congress victory would not be surprising given this trend, shrugged a party insider. There is a strong belief within the BJP that losing these two states will   impact the national election. Defeats in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh can be blamed on incumbent chief ministers, insulating Modi from negative impact. MP is quite a different ball game. Although it is an assembly election and therefore a verdict on chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s three-term rule, the state is emerging as a microcosm of the challenges that lie ahead for Modi as he gears up for 2019. Similarities abound; like Modi, Chouhan is still a popular figure among voters, way ahead of his Congress rivals, in popularity ratings. At the same time, he is battling voter fatigue and popular discontent over unmet expectations in the state, much like Modi on a national scale. If he pulls it off, party insiders believe that Amit Shah, organiser and manager par excellence, can do one better for Modi with the vast resources and machinery at his command. Yet, there are worries on ground in MP, worries that are spilling over to the bordering state of UP which is so crucial to the BJP’s fate in 2019. (Remember, the BJP won 71 out of UP’s 80 seats to sweep to a majority in the Lok Sabha.) While the BJP is fighting off irate upper caste and OBC groups, the Congress is aggressively wooing them with its soft Hindu look and Rahul’s ‘ ’, reinforced by his recent trek to Kailash Mansarovar. Mayawati’s declaration that she will not have a pre-poll alliance in MP with the Congress should be seen against this backdrop. Her so-called “dumping’’ of the Congress may actually help the party in its outreach to upper caste and OBC groups who have been BJP voters for the past several elections. The anger among farmers has only compounded the BJP’s headaches. Again, MP has seen several farmer protests and Chouhan blotted his copybook with police firing at Mandsaur in which several farmers were killed. This is another fault-line which the Congress is trying to exploit. MP is fertile ground for the Congress and a victory here will spread ripples through neighbouring UP where the BJP is on a slippery slope because of popular unrest on similar issues, and chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s poor governance. Recent opinion polls have however given the Congress the edge. If it performs as is being predicted, the MP verdict could be the game changer the Congress has been desperately seeking. If it falls, as it has in past elections, it will reaffirm the image of Rahul Gandhi as a loser. All his strategies – the Hindu card, the outreach to upper castes, wooing farmers – will have flopped. If this be the case, the BJP and Modi can breathe more easily in the run up to 2019.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Sanjana Ray,"Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday, 10 October, slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi for taking his comment on ‘false promises’ “out of context” and clarified the back story behind his remarks. “Since when has Rahul Gandhi started understanding Marathi? He should have gotten it translated from someone first. Without understanding it, he congratulated me on Twitter as well. He has done this before. I want to tell you all that I have always delivered on my promises,” said Gadkari. On a Marathi reality show, ‘Assal Pavhane, Irsal Namune’ , Gadkari, while speaking as a guest alongside Bollywood actor Nana Patekar, said that the BJP had come to power by making “false promises”. Gadkari's statement was aired on Colors in two parts on 4 and 5 October. Gadkari on Wednesday narrated the backstory and explained the context behind his comments. Here is the full clarification: “I was appearing on a show on the channel Colors Marathi. There was a discussion happening on poll promises. When there were Vidhan Sabha elections in Maharashtra, Gopinath Munde and Devendra Fadnavis had told me that they want to announce that they will do away with tolls. I told them not to say anything like that since it will have financial repercussions. Then they said to me that the BJP government is set to come to power. To which I said that if we do, we will have to solve the problem (deliver on the promise). Then I said that since we've been on the Opposition for many years, we made certain promises in the poll memorandum, as we were not used to be in power. This entire clip of the Marathi show is available with Manoj Wadekar. You can take it from him and get translated if you don’t understand. I didn’t name Modiji in the meeting, neither did I name BJP. I also did not talk about the Rs 15 lakh promise. A Delhi based newspaper put out a completely baseless report. Since when has Rahul Gandhi started understanding Marathi? He should have gotten it translated from someone first. Without understanding it, he congratulated me on Twitter as well. He has done this before. I want to tell you all that I have always delivered on my promises. The discussion that happened in the Marathi show about tolls, that too has been fulfilled by Fadnavis by eradicating tolls. There was no reference to whatever was reported.” The first part of the episode, titled “ ”, was aired on 4 October, the second part, “ ”, was available to viewers on 5 October. Gadkari’s statement was also shared by the Congress on Twitter, with the message that the Union minister had just proved that the Modi government “was built on jumlas and fake promises”. Party President Rahul Gandhi also tweeted the video. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Chitranshul Sinha,"The Delhi High Court on 1 October set aside the transit remand order, and subsequent detention under house arrest, of activist Gautam Navlakha. Navlakha had been arrested by the Maharashtra Police as an accused in the Bhima Koregaon case , on 29 August. On 4 October, the Maharashtra government moved the Supreme Court against Navlakha’s release. The case will in all probability come up before the newly appointed Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi. The High Court found that the transit remand was granted without complying with the constitutional requirements under Article 22(1) which mandates that every accused upon arrest shall be detained in custody   being informed at the earliest, of the  , and shall have the right to consult and be defended by a lawyer of his / her choosing. The Supreme Court in  while framing guidelines to be followed by the police and other investigative agencies upon a person’s arrest, emphasised that Article 22(1) is a constitutional safeguard which must be read with the ‘Right to Life’ enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. The High Court takes note of this judgment while commenting on the non-compliance with Article 22(1). On the contrary, the order records the presence of a ‘duty lawyer’ empanelled by the Court, representing Navlakha. Such lawyers are usually for legal aid, who are empanelled to represent indigent persons who cannot afford to engage a lawyer by themselves. Further, the order also did not record any contentions by the duty lawyer on behalf of Navlakha. The natural conclusion is that the entire exercise was mechanical and undertaken as hollow compliance with the law. Such compliance is not   compliance and was therefore rightly declared to be in contravention of Article 22(1) by the High Court. Another contravention noted by the Court was that Navlakha himself was not intimated of the grounds of his arrest as required by Article 22(1). Admittedly, the police intimated his partner   the arrest, but   of the grounds for arrest. The High Court came down heavily against these transgressions, and the offending contraventions formed an important part of its reasons for setting aside Navlakha’s transit remand and detention. The Maharashtra Police was brazen in its conduct when it contended that such contraventions were inevitable and shockingly claimed that some or the other law must be by-passed on occasion. The Court rejected this contention and put the burden of ascertaining compliance with requirements under law upon the magistrate, and found that this burden was   discharged in Navlakha’s case. The public profile of the Bhima Koregaon case meant that the media looked at the minutest of aspects of the magisterial proceedings, but we will never know the number of cases where arrested persons don’t get a lawyer of their choice and are saddled with a legal aid lawyer ‘on duty’ by the magistrate just to give the proceedings a veneer of regularity. When we speak about police reforms, it should inherently include reforms at the level of the lower judiciary which unwittingly abets miscarriage of justice and violation of fundamental rights. The State’s reaction to this issue can be gauged from the petition seeking leave to appeal filed by the Maharashtra government before the Supreme Court. It claims that the High Court unnecessarily looked into the Article 22 aspect, and claims that no occasion arose for the High Court to look into this issue. Never mind that the petition does not urge any legal or constitutional ground in support of this argument. Machinations of criminal justice delivery should not be mechanical, as deprivation of liberty without due process is a violation of the fundamental right to life and liberty.

Arun Dev,"In 1999, Ballari – a mine-rich district in north Karnataka – was the arena for a political showdown between Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj. Gandhi won the elections that year, but over the next decade the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) managed to wrest power in the region. Almost two decades later, in November 2018, Ballari will once again be closely watched in Karnataka and outside as a precursor of the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Ahead of the state Assembly polls in May earlier this year, BS Yeddyurappa and B Sriramalu of the BJP and CS Puttraju of the JD(S) had vacated their seats in Shivamoga, Ballari, and Mandya, respectively. On Saturday, the Election Commission announced the bypolls in these three Lok Sabha constituencies on 3 November. Two strongmen of the Congress and the BJP will be going head on during this byelection. As the Lok Sabha elections are expected next year, the newly elected MPs will have a tenure of less than six months. Leaders of all three political parties have expressed their surprise over the Election Commission’s decision to announce a by-election for such a short term. The Election Commission, however, pointed out that the seats would be vacant for more than a year if bypolls are not held, which would be against rules. These three bypolls, according to political observers, won’t make a big change in the voting patterns in the state. However, Ballari might indicate the change of wind in the state since the Assembly elections. In Ballari, the choice of the candidates remains unclear. However, several names have been doing the rounds in party circles over the past few days. In the BJP camp, Sriramalu’s sister Shanta and his uncle Farkirappa are pitched as potential candidates, while from the Congress camp, B Nagendra, who was elected as an MLA during 2018 election, is said to be a candidate. The JD(S) will not be contesting elections in Ballari. The Congress has called for a meeting of the Planning Committee on Tuesday, 9 October, to finalise their candidates. The BJP is expected to hold a meeting by the end of the week. However, according to sources, in their stronghold of Shivamoga, the BJP will be fielding Yeddyurappa’s elder son BY Raghavendra. The JD(S) is yet to decide their candidate for Mandya. According to party leaders, it will be a close associate of the Gowda family. For the Congress, the bypoll isn’t just about winning Ballari and sending a positive message to its cadre. The bypoll threatens to restart a political instability in the party which was recently brought under control. In the last week of August, a turf war between Shivakumar and Jarkiholi brothers – Satish and Ramesh – had threatened to bring down the government. The bone of contention for Ramesh and Satish Jarkiholi was Shivakumar’s attempts to assert his influence in the districts in north Karnataka. The brothers, who have control of the politics of the region, had seen Shivakumar as a threat. The conflict between Shivakumar and Jarkiholi brothers was resolved with the Congress high command promising to induct an MLA from Ballari to the Cabinet and make him the minister in-charge of Ballari. But with Shivakumar leading the campaign in Ballari, there is fear of dissidence finding its way back to the Congress. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Akbar had rubbished the allegations against him, calling them baseless and driven by agenda before the general elections in 2019. “Why has this storm risen a few months before a general election? Is there an agenda? You be the judge. These false, baseless and wild allegations have caused irreparable damage to my reputation and goodwill,” he said. The opposition reacted to MJ Akbar’s statement and attacked BJP’s silence over the issue, pointing out to the irony of BJP’s flagship women empowerment programme ‘Beti Padhao Beti Bachao’ on one hand and its disregard for the #MeToo movement on the other. A senior functionary in the party told   that a nationwide campaign would be launched from Monday by the Mahila Congress, the women’s wing of the party, starting from Akbar’s residence in New Delhi, demanding his resignation. Before Akbar’s statement, the Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen had demanded he resign on moral grounds. The BJP has remained largely silent on the issue. Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha said the nation had been betrayed.

Vikram Venkateswaran,"It is now one week, since writer and journalist Sandhya Menon shared an anonymous post alleging sexual misconduct by lyricist Vairamuthu. It took Tamil language websites almost two full days to react, and the first story in the local press was from barely  . By default, the story on allegations of sexual misconduct against Vairamuthu became a  . So why is Vairamuthu’s name the only one to have come up in TN’s Me Too movement? And why does it seem to have died down so soon? Also, why is public sentiment (in the media) in favour of Vairamuthu, despite more than a dozen women alleging sexual misconduct by him? The core idea of the Me Too campaign is to allow the survivor to speak up, and to listen. This requires a safe space to vent, where support will be unconditional. Sadly, such is not the case in the Tamil Twitterverse. As is the case with news and social media, cinema too has never been apolitical in Tamil Nadu. Vairamuthu is seen not just as a lyricist, but as an ardent supporter of Dravidianism. Since the majority of the media itself is pro-Dravidian, a certain level of respect for Vairamuthu as well as fear of his obvious political affiliations (to the DMK) come into play. The late former CM M Karunanidhi himself was one of the guests at Vairamuthu’s son’s wedding. The two were often seen together, and Vairamuthu is seen by many as the torchbearer of Karunanidhi’s brand of Dravidianism, and of course, a worthy successor to his writing. That Chinmayi’s tweets are not considered credible until Vairamuthu’s response gives them credence, is ironic, and a disturbing reflection of media in Tamil Nadu, and the film industry. Samantha Akkineni, Varalaxmi Saratkumar and Siddharth. That’s about all of the celebrity voices from the Tamil film industry to come out in support of Chinmayi’s tweets against Vairamuthu. Both Samantha and Siddharth are seen as outsiders in the Tamil film industry, since they both work extensively in Telugu cinema as well. Of these, Siddharth alone named Vairamuthu in his tweet and asked for an investigation and action to be taken. It was only on Sunday, six days after Chinmayi’s tweet, that Vishal, who is now the head of the Film Producer’s Council, expressed his solidarity with the movement. Neither is Vairamuthu politically neutral, nor is the media non-partisan. Everything that the lyricist says / does / is accused of, is therefore perceived through black or saffron coloured glasses. The first reaction to Chinmayi’s tweets against Vairamuthu on social media, from both sides of the political spectrum was to link it to his speech on the Vaishnavite Saint Andal, in which he tried to prove that she was a ‘ ’, with no father. Those who opposed this view spoke of how he had it coming. And those who supported Vairamuthu called Chinmayi’s tweets a Brahmin vendetta. Sample this: And then there’s the usual ‘why now’, ‘where are the facts’ debate that go on to dilute the movement. Again, Siddharth, above everyone else, came to the rescue: Pianist Anil Srinivasan, was probably the first musician to voice his support for Chinmayi. Through a series of tweets and an  , he made his support for her and to the movement, unequivocal. He was soon followed by activist and Carnatic vocalist T M Krishna, who responded to Chinmayi’s ‘offender’s list’ of Carnatic musicians through tweets and an  . Outside the Twitterverse, which in itself occupies a very tiny mindspace in Tamil Nadu, there is an almost eerie silence with regard to the Me Too movement. Is it because everyone is now busy with the festival season and have no time to engage in “gossip”? Is it the fallout of a movement that was born, raised and currently thrives only on one social media platform? Or is it because those who can actually make a difference by speaking up, are either silent, or worse, ambiguous, on the issue? There are no tweets from Kamal Haasan on the issue.

The News Minute,"Malayalam actor Thulasidharan Nair, also known as Kollam Thulashi, has been booked by the Kerala Police for his controversial remarks against women during a NDA protest meeting over the Sabarimala Temple issue, police said Sunday, 14 October. An FIR was registered Saturday against Thulashi under Indian Penal Code sections, including 295 (A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), and also under section 119 (A) of Kerala Police Act which deals with acts in public places degrading the dignity of women. The Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, wherein it allowed women of all ages to enter the temple, was a matter of controversy – with it being welcomed and opposed in equal measure. While religion and divinity have been the grounds for opposition, and protests have been held against the verdict, there have not been any open threats from prominent voices. Until now. In a barbaric and preposterous statement, Malayalam actor Kollam Thulasi said women who try to enter Sabarimala should be ripped apart. “The mothers (elderly woman) taking part in the protest against the judgment should go to Sabarimala. Then those women should rip apart the ones who try to enter the temple,"" he said. Thulasi's career in Malayalam movies was one that largely saw him donning the role of villain – being misogynistic, if not raping women. As Thulasi made these comments in his filmy style, the audience cheered him on. He was speaking at a rally by the Sabarimala Viswasa Samrekshana Jatha (rally to protect customs of Sabarimala) at Chavara in Kollam. BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai, who is leading the rally, and other BJP leaders were present at the rally when Thulasi made the declaration. When The News Minute repeatedly asked if he was present at the rally, he first evaded the question, then said he was not willing to speak further. Earlier, Thulasi was embroiled in a controversy for supporting his colleague Dileep, an accused in the case of kidnap and rape of a female actor in February 2017.

The Quint,"Less than two months after courting controversy for hugging Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, at a time when India's relation with its neighbour was at its lowest, Navjot Sidhu stirred up a fresh controversy on Saturday, 13 October, when he drew an unwarranted cultural analogy between Pakistan and South India. Speaking at a literary festival in Kasol, Sidhu said, ""If I go to Tamil Nadu, I don’t understand the language. Not that I don’t like the food, but I can’t take it for long. That culture is totally different. But if I travel to Pakistan there is no difficulty. The language is the same and everything there is just amazing."" The Punjab tourism and culture minister was apparently trying to highlight the cultural affinity Punjab shares with Pakistan. However, by drawing a comparison over the sensitive lingual divide issue, Sidhu, in the process, has perhaps compounded his troubles. Sidhu also clarified his hug to Pakistan Army chief in his own style. The cricketer-turned-television anchor-turned politician said, ""My Jhappi was no conspiracy, it was no Rafale deal... If somebody tells me that they are ready to open the Kartarpur corridor. I mean they said it 400 times that we are ready to open the corridor then this is the way I show affection. I will hug and also kiss them. I care two hoots about people who play dirty politics on that. I have lived my life on my terms."" His comments were aired by CNN-News18 on Saturday. Sidhu had visited Pakistan to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician, on 18 August. During the visit, Sidhu had hugged Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, triggering a torrent of criticism from the BJP and also from within his Congress party, including Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. Later, clarifying his hug to Bajwa, Sidhu said that while greeting him, General Bajwa informed him about a sentimental gesture proposed for the Sikhs, after which he hugged the general out of emotions. Sidhu claimed that Pakistan was considering a proposal to provide free access to Sikh devotees to a historic gurdwara just three kilometres inside Pakistan. However, later, both Indian and Pakistani governments confirmed that ""no formal communication"" took place on Kartarpur corridor issue. The BJP had, however, gone hammers and tongs after its former four-time Member of Parliament, even going on to call him a Pakistani agent. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Arun Dev,"HD Kumaraswamy’s swearing-in ceremony, as the chief minister of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government in Karnataka, was looked at as an informal announcement of the grand Opposition alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party. In a long list of high-profile guests was the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati, who stood next to Sonia Gandhi. Her party was part of the new coalition government by the virtue of forming a pre-poll alliance with the JD(S). Too busy to read? Listen to the story instead With the Congress and the BSP parting ways, it is the JD(S) that’s caught in a difficult situation. The party needs the BSP to consolidate votes from the Dalit community in the state. At the same time, they are preparing for a scenario, where they have to choose between the JD(S) or the Congress. After accepting the resignation, Kumaraswamy said he will talk to Mahesh and ‘sort things out’. JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda said it was just an incident and there is still time for general election and to bring all parties together. The pre-poll alliance with the BSP was the JD(S)‘s attempt to tap into the Dalit votes in the state. Even during the Assembly polls, the JD(S) was counting on the Dailt votes to win several seats that were lost by small margins. The JD(S) partnered with the BSP in constituencies where they lost by very narrow margins. In these constituencies, the BSP vote share was equivalent to the JD(S)’s margin of loss. Apart from that, Mayawati held four large meetings and rallies to mobilise Dalit votes in the JD(S)’s favour in several constituencies. A senior Congress leader said choosing the Congress over the BSP, in case things go sour, is an obvious choice for the JD(S). “They needed the BSP’s help in Assembly elections because they were contesting against us (Congress). But now that we are allies, there is no need for the BSP,” the leader said. In coming days, analysts believe that Deve Gowda and JD(S) will be crucial for the Congress to bring Mayawati back to the grand alliance, for the sake of the alliance and his party.

Shadab Moizee," Vishal Sharma Is Mayawati’s influence in the Dalit community still ever-present? Will the Dalit community support PM Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? Will Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad Raavan’s release from jail pose a challenge to Mayawati’s Dalit base? These are the questions on people’s minds as the 2019 Lok Sabha elections creep closer. To get the answers and understand the minds of Dalit youths,   reached Mayawati’s den Saharanpur and the surrounding areas. First, we reached Chand Samand village in Muzaffarnagar’s Khatauli. We met around 20-25 youngsters there. When we asked them about Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar, nearly every person present there said in a bold voice that he was their hero. Now the question was, why did the youth here consider Chandrashekhar their hero? Before the question ended, Ravi Kumar answered that Chandrashekhar was a young person who was working for creating awareness in society and was fighting against injustice. When we asked about Mayawati in the midst of the praise of Chandrashekhar, 22-year-old Kapil Kumar said that she never comes forward openly, and speaks out only to score political points. “Only Chandrashekhar has supported us without any political purpose.” The youth here appeared to be unhappy with Mayawati. On the other side, we also met some people who urged Chandrashekhar to stay away from politics. The next stop was Saharanpur’s Lakhnaur village. Here, we met Parul Kumar, who had completed his diploma in engineering. On the issue of Chandrashekhar and Mayawati, Parul said, “If Chandraskher calls Mayawati his   (aunt) and she is welcoming him, then we will support both of them. Otherwise, we support only Chandrashekhar.” After leaving Lakhnaur village, we reached the city of Sahranpur, where we met around 8-9 students of the Sant Ravidas Hostel. These educated youths regard Mayawati as their voice. We met Aditya Kumar, who was preparing for entrance exams to enter government service. Aditya said: When we talked to these people about Mayawati and Chandrashekhar, most of them agreed that they should fight the polls together. As the 2019 Assembly elections are coming nearer, there is talk of an alliance in Uttar Pradesh.   tried to gauge the opinion of Dalit youths regarding this issue. The next stop was Kumhar Hera village. The village had earlier voted for Modi in 2014. They feel that all the promises they had believed in 2014 turned out to be false. Unemployment and security are issues here. We met Shivam here. Shivam had worked for BJP’s victory in 2014. But now he feels otherwise. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Goa Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Manohar Parrikar’s condition continued to be critical, even as he was discharged from the AIIMS hospital in New Delhi, on Sunday, 14 October, and returned to his home state. Parrikar (62) was flown in a special flight and later taken to his private residence at Dona Paula in an ambulance. According to sources in AIIMS, he was shifted  in the morning to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a while after his condition deteriorated. But later, the administration decided to discharge him. The state-run Goa Medical College and Hospital has made elaborate arrangements at his private residence with a team of doctors on standby to take care of his health. Parrikar was admitted to the AIIMS on 15 September. On Friday, Parrikar met Goa BJP's core committee members and ministers from coalition partners at AIIMS to discuss ways to ensure his government functions normally during his absence from office due to ill health. Leaders of the ruling BJP and its allies, who met Parrikar separately, had ruled out any change in leadership in the coastal state. The core committee is the BJP's key decision-making body in Goa, comprising senior leaders like Parrikar, Union minister Shripad Naik and party state chief Vinay Tendulkar, among others. Parrikar has been ailing since mid-February and has been treated at different hospitals including those in Goa, Mumbai and the US. Union minister Naik told reporters in Panaji earlier in the day that it is okay if Parrikar undergoes treatment in Goa but he needs to take rest. ""There has been an improvement in his health compared to what it was when he was flown to AIIMS last month,"" the AYUSH minister said. Naik dismissed any possibility of dissolution of the Goa Assembly and expressed confidence that the Parrikar-led government will complete its five-year term. Questions over the stability of the Goa government have been raised by the Opposition Congress because of Parrikar's illness. These comprise 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) as well as three Independents.

Eshwar Gole,"Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar on Sunday, 14 October, claimed the sexual harassment allegations against him are baseless and his lawyers are deciding on a legal course of action, ANI reported. “Accusation without evidence has become a viral fever among some sections. Whatever be the case, now that I have returned, my lawyers will look into these wild and baseless allegations in order to decide our future course of legal action,” said Akbar. He also said that these allegations are being levelled only due to the upcoming assembly elections. “Why has this storm risen a few months before a general election? Is there an agenda? You be the judge. These false, baseless and wild allegations have caused irreparable damage to my reputation and goodwill,” he said. Commenting on journalist Priya Ramani’s 2017 report in which she hadn’t specifically named Akbar, he said that she couldn’t have mentioned his name is the report as there was no truth to her allegations. “Priya Ramani began this campaign a year ago with a magazine article. She did not, however, name me as she knew it was an incorrect story. When asked recently why she had not named me, she replied, in a Tweet: “Never named him because he didn't 'do' anything.""” he said. Calling the allegations “an agenda”, Akbar said that a “sea of innuendo, speculation and abusive diatribe” has been built around something that never happened. “If I didn't do anything, where and what is the story? There's no story. But some are total, unsubstantiated hearsay; others confirm, on the record, that I didn’t do anything,” he said. Former   employee Shutapa Paul, who accused MJ Akbar of sexual harassment, said that she was “shocked and dismayed” by the minister’s “brazen shaming.” In his statement, Akbar had claimed: “Shutapa Paul states, “The man never laid a hand on me.” Shuma Raha says, “I must clarify, however, that he didn’t actually ‘do’ anything”. One woman, Anju Bharti, went to the absurd extent of claiming I was partying in a swimming pool. I do not know how to swim.” Calling journalist Ghazala Wahab’s claims “bizzare”, he said the allegations were false, motivated and baseless. “Another accusation was made repeatedly by Ms Ghazala Wahab, in an effort to damage my reputation. She claimed that she had been molested in office, 21 years ago. This is 16 years before I entered public life, and when I was in media. The only office where I worked with Ghazala Wahab was that of The Asian Age. A part of the editorial team then worked out of a small hall. At the time concerned, I had a very tiny cubicle, patched together by plywood and glass. Others had tables and chairs two feet away,” he said. He further said that Wahab continued working with him despite her alleged discomfort, which proves that nothing of such sort ever really happened. “Pertinent to remember Ms Ramani and Ms Wahab kept working with me even after these alleged incidents; clearly establishes they had no apprehension and discomfort. Reason why they remained silent for decades is very apparent, as Ms Ramani has herself stated, I never did anything,” said Akbar. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Asim Kamal,"Unfazed by the Bahujan Samaj Party's decision to not align with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Sunday, 14 October, that the party is ""still in the driver's seat"" and in touch with all ""possible partners"" in the poll-bound state. Scindia, who is spearheading the Congress campaign in Madhya Pradesh, also said the entire state leadership and party cadre was ""working cohesively"" to chart out the party's plan to dislodge the BJP government after ""14 years of misrule"". Asked if the BSP could cut into the Congress' vote share, he told PTI in an interview that, ""I don't think so. Obviously, the alliance would have had its own benefits, but as things stand today, support for the Congress is running deep in Madhya Pradesh.” “The workers are motivated and the people are looking to us for change. So, we are definitely still in the driver's seat,"" Scindia said. Replying to a query about a possible tie-up with the Samajwadi Party and the Gondwana Gantantra Party after Bahujan Samaj Party's decision to not align with the Congress in the state, Scindia said, ""We are in touch with all possible partners. Our ultimate goal is to beat the Bharatiya Janata Party. We are not currently ruling out the possibility of an alliance."" His remarks come days after BSP chief Mayawati announced her party will not forge an alliance with the Congress ""at any cost"" for the upcoming Assembly polls in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Scindia said the party's ""driving mantra"" is ' ' (It is time for change), and added that this is ""not a slogan, this is a reality, a commitment to change"". ""We are not fighting this election on the Modi or Shivraj factor but the 'people factor'. The people of Madhya Pradesh have suffered from the BJP rule for 14 years. Everywhere we look, the people are exasperated and angry,"" the MP from Guna said. Talking about the issues that the Congress will raise during the campaign, Scindia said the party will take the fight to the streets. The state will go to polls on 28 November and counting of votes will be held on 11 December. Congress has launched an aggressive campaign in Madhya Pradesh with party chief Rahul Gandhi visiting the state frequently. Gandhi will be in the state on Monday, 15 October as well and will address several public meetings, and take part in a road show in Gwalior. Asked what was different internally in the Congress organisation as compared to the past three elections and whether differences between senior leaders had been sorted, Scindia said the party was united and there were regular meetings on key matters, including on overhauling the organisation, reviving and rejuvenating party cadres and strengthening the system at the district and block level. ""We understand that to fight the BJP, we will have to go down to the booth level and fight. Under Congress President Rahul Gandhi's uniting leadership, we are working as a single INC unit, coming together under the umbrella of a common vision and mission for the development of Madhya Pradesh,"" the 47-year-old leader said. On opinion polls putting the Congress marginally ahead of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Scindia said he believes his party is ""in the lead"". The people are now looking to the Congress for change and are hopeful that the party will bring a wave of development, progress and honesty, the former Union minister said. Asked if the Congress was bargaining hard as a result of which state-level alliances were failing and damaging prospects of a grand alliance in 2019, Scindia said the party was trying to build reasonable alliances that were mutually beneficial for all involved actors, and one that will be able to give the BJP a strong fight. ""For example, in Madhya Pradesh, there was clearly a mismatch between the BSP's vote share and the seats they were demanding – obviously, that would not be strategically beneficial for us. So, it is not about bargaining hard for the sake of debate, it is about reaching the most effective agreement,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Revati Laul,"    November 2013. My colleague and friend at   magazine where we worked told me she had been raped by the Editor-in-Chief Tarun Tejpal. I was black with anger when I read her   complaint. As a woman and the next-in-command after Tarun, the complaint was sent to her and she did not act adequately on it as mandated by the law. She apologised for the same in front of the NCW, Goa. In one of her  , Shoma had said ""The criticism that I did not act in a measured way or in a correct situational frame-work, I accept that and I have apologised for it. But I would also like to remind everybody that I had really a day and half to act on any of these before the media storm took over"". Now, as I read journalist Seema Mustafa’s   of her own behaviour when complaints were taken to her about the then   boss M J Akbar, I am filled with the same rage. Ghazala Wahab said she was a young and petrified journalist who Akbar preyed on repeatedly and about whom she complained to Seema. And nothing happened. Seema says the following, “Akbar used the work place to hire young girls who received undue attention. We don’t have any idea – and I say this with complete responsibility and after discussion with a couple of my senior former colleagues –whether he had sexual relations with them, but yes women were promoted out of turn, brought on to Page 1 sub-editing as he handled that directly, and there were whispers about specific girls on the desk. London was a choice posting, almost always reserved for girls, though a couple of guys did dent this bastion, and the perception was that the sub editor (never a reporter) posted there was the current favourite – and available for Akbar when he visited London which was often.” She said the complaint wasn’t explicit, and further, “We suspected a great deal; often felt we knew a lot of what we weren’t actually able to see, but in real terms there was not a shred of evidence, ever.” As a journalist, surely Seema cannot ignore the fact that the onus of collecting the evidence is on the person being complained to – that is, her. And that brings me to another troubling question that #MeToo has thrown up that goes to the very heart of the matter. #MeToo disrupts like nothing else because it calls out the people we admire and love. Well, quite often, by pretending it isn’t crashing. It’s a defence mechanism so many of us are guilty of. I will continue to call out people like Shoma and Seema on their utter and complete abandonment of their responsibility as bosses receiving complaints of harassment. But I want to dig deeper. I want to look at my own storytelling and where it has been spectacular in spinning stories that prevent me from seeing the ugliness in men I have befriended, admired and loved. Let me give you just two examples. A dear friend, liberal and feminist was charged with rape. My first instinct was to say – No. Impossible. This cannot be true. Every cell in my body tells me he is  . But then I had to stop and think. If I externalised that thought, would I be like Shoma and Seema? That was an unbearable prospect. So I said to myself, since I am not privy to the woman’s side of the story and cannot get to her at all, I will refrain from forming an opinion in the case. And I will stay away from my friend. Even after the case went to trial and he was acquitted, I continue to remain incommunicado. I am deeply conflicted and confused. I read the judgment and that didn’t help at all. I recently read a report – the first and only time I heard the woman’s side of the story. It made my stomach churn. Who did what? Was there assault or not? I have no idea, and if I was faced with the task of investigating this case as part of an internal complaints committee at an office, I would have to step aside and say – I am a friend of the alleged offender and not in a position to be objective. So let’s pick someone else. I would still have to choose sides in who I stand up for and associate with thereafter. And this is the extraordinary power and git of #MeToo. It puts us all – women, men and all other genders – in a quandary about ourselves. There is another time where I was involved with a man who I knew was full of violence. It was in fact his violence and self-destructive streak that attracted me to him in the first place. He thumped his fist in anger on the restaurant table on our first date and threw a beer can at the wall because I didn’t respond the way he wanted. He went on to break the nose of a guard at the gate because he was asleep on the job and potentially put me in danger. The night the guard’s nose was broken is the night I slept with this man. I was both fascinated and terrified. I knew what I was doing and also did not. I was in Afghanistan. It didn’t last for more than a few days. But the question I am asking myself as #MeToo forces me to look at the dark mirror and see myself reflected back is – what part of predatory behaviour and violence in men have I internalised so deeply that it’s mixed up with love? Will I never watch a Woody Allen film again? Each day #MeToo makes the world around me implode, and forces me to change too. I am terrified of what I see and at the same time, willing to step inside the chamber of horrors and look at all the ghosts – my own and all the rest.  ‘ ’,    (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Malavika Balasubramanian,"Thirty-nine years ago, on 4 May 1979, Margaret Thatcher was sworn in as the first female prime minister of Britain. One of the most powerful leaders of her time, Thatcher is credited with changing the course of modern British politics. The 2011 documentary   traces the former prime minister’s journey from Parliament to prime ministership. The 46-minute film begins with Thatcher’s first appearance outside 10 Downing Street after she won her first mandate in 1979. Quoting the prayer of St Francis, she says: “Where there is discord, may we bring harmony; Where there is error, may we bring truth; Where there is doubt, may we bring faith; And where there is despair, may we bring hope.” Popularly called the ‘Iron Lady’, Thatcher earned the nickname for her tough stance against the then Soviet Union, which, according to her, was clamouring for world dominance. Speaking about his adversary, Roy Hattersley from the Labour Party in the documentary says: The title of the documentary aptly borrows from Thatcher’s speech at the Conservative Party Conference in 1980, after she was elected prime minister. Thatcher delivered the speech in the first year of her taking oath, when a bleak economic landscape stared at her after her election. In tandem with her Chancellor of Exchequer, she lowered the direct taxes while increasing indirect taxes, helping reduce the inflation rates from over 15 percent to 8 percent by 1982. However, not everybody was happy, as unemployment rates had reached a new high since World War II – and a second shot at premiership looked bleak. But one event played fate into Thatcher’s hands – the Falklands War. The increasing unemployment had led to growing resentment for Thatcher, despite the economic respite. However, the Falklands War of 1982 turned the tide in Thatcher’s favour . The military of Argentina laid siege on the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering a war. However, Thatcher’s able handling of the situation led to a victory, and she was touted a ‘capable war leader.’ Needless to say, the victory also enabled her to secure a second term as prime minister in the subsequent 1983 elections. In her first mandate, Thatcher also limited the powers enjoyed by trade and labour unions, as she felt that they were detrimental to the functioning of a democracy. Her decision resulted in protests and strikes by several labour unions; however, these protests soon fizzled out. During the course of her second term, Thatcher announced the closure of at least 20 of the 174 state-owned mines, leading to a nationwide protest by coal mine workers in 1984. This was the largest uprising the Thatcher government ever saw. The Prime Minister was, however, prepared to beat the strike, having stored fuel stocks and ensured that forces were adequately equipped to handle the strike. This resulted in the government’s victory over the mine workers, and a year later, the strike was called off by the workers without a deal. The documentary also mentions the attempt on her life by the Irish Army (IRA), when she was at a Brighton hotel to attend a Conservative Party Conference. Thatcher was preparing for her speech at the conference, when the IRA bombed the section of the hotel she was staying in. Despite the assassination attempt, Thatcher insisted that the conference take place as per schedule the next day. The IRA claimed responsibility of the attack the next day, going on to issue an audacious warning that a similar attack was headed Thatcher’s way. The slope in Thatcher’s popularity became increasingly visible in the 1989 party leadership elections, when her post was challenged by back-bencher MP Sir Anthony Meyer. Though Thatcher won the ballot by a clear majority, her overconfident attitude and steadfast refusal to believe in poll projections that indicated her decline, led to her downfall. Soon after, Thatcher’s counsellor Nigel Lawson resigned and her deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, followed suit, owing to differences over the European Monetary Union. By then, the scales had tipped against Thatcher, with the polls predicting a Labour Party lead. In November that year, MP Michael Heseltine challenged Thatcher’s leadership, and won in the second ballot. Her resignation came as a shock to many across the world, including her dear friend and former US President Ronald Reagan. Over a decade after she stepped down as prime minister, Thatcher quit politics in 2002 after a series of strokes, breathing her last in 2013. She, however, remains one of the most controversial political figures in British history, and is credited with playing a fundamental role in shaping the nation’s course.

Malavika Balasubramanian,"On 14 October 1956, Dr BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution, took a life-altering decision. The Dalit strongman decided to quit Hinduism and take up Buddhism, along with close to 3,65,000 of his followers, in Nagpur. Six decades later, we look at the reasons behind Ambedkar’s decision to alter not just his own path but also the lives of a largely marginalised Dalit community. Ambedkar had long decided to change his religion to escape what he considered a “threat to freedom” – the varna or caste system, propagated by Hinduism. Frustrated by what he believed was an inherent part of the Hindu religion, Ambedkar opined that conversion was the only method for Dalits to denounce the caste system. Almost 20 years before he actually converted, Ambedkar addressed the Mahars – a section of the community considered untouchable – in Mumbai, apprising them of his decision to convert. In a lengthy yet heavily influential  , Ambedkar urged: Having said this, Ambedkar then contemplated for almost two decades, before he chose to convert to Buddhism over other religions.  to Gauri Vishwanathan, a professor of English at Columbia University, the reason behind his choice was in fact, the “foreignness” associated with Islam and Christianity. Apart from a deep-rooted disdain for the caste system inherent in Hinduism, another possible reason that could have driven Ambedkar’s choice was that Buddhism met his core values of rationality, morality and justice.  to religion studies specialist Christopher Queen, Buddhism helped Ambedkar realise his requirements – ""the exercise of individual choice based on reason and historical consciousness.” Further, Queen also suggests that Amebedkar modified the religion’s basic tenets to fit his idea of Buddhism – particularly by including the values of equality, fraternity and liberty from the French revolution. Ambedkar’s re-interpretation was called the Dalit Buddhist movement, or Navayana, or Neo-Buddhism. This “new sect” of the religion now rejected the “four noble truths” of traditional Buddhism, and was instead remodeled in terms of class struggle and social justice. Ambedkar decided to convert with his followers in Nagpur, a move that was criticised by many – since the city was also considered the birthplace of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. However, Ambedkar   his decision a day after he converted – on 15 October 1956. He said that he had chosen the city not for the RSS, but for the ‘Nag’ people, who according to history, spearheaded the movement against the Aryan people and also propagated Buddhism. Likening Dalits to the Nag people, Ambedkar reportedly said: And although Ambedkar did not live long enough to practice a religion he so-well espoused – dying only two months after his official conversion – he led several thousands to adopt his re-interpretation of the religion. In fact, Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur, the site where Ambedkar led the 1956 mass conversion, remains a sacred shrine for Navayana Buddhism, and is of special significance to millions.

PTI,"Accusing the BJP of acting ""power hungry"" in Goa, the Congress on Saturday, 13 October, demanded that Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar step down and it be allowed to prove majority, by convening a special session of the state assembly. Congress leaders Pawan Khera and Goa PCC Chief Girish Chodankar, claimed that the BJP is not removing Parrikar from the Chief Minister’s post, fearing that he might “spill the beans” on the Rafale fighter jet deal. The opposition party also accused the BJP of ""betraying"" the people of Goa and ""killing governance"" in the state. The opposition party alleged that the BJP ""usurped"" power in Goa through backdoor. ""People of Goa had given the mandate to the Congress. Governor Mridula Sinha should listen to the voice of people of Goa and opposition parties and allow us to prove our numbers on the floor of the House,” Chodankar said. He claimed of a Congress majority in Goa and added, “Goans deserve a full time chief minister and to ensure democracy and constitutional functioning, a floor test is imperative"". At the same time, he added “no constitutional morality can be expected from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, because they are drunk with power”. Replying to a query, he said as the Defence Minister, Parrikar must have had a lot of information on the Rafale deal. ""So we have no doubt that the moment the Prime Minister and the BJP President pressure him or demand his resignation or they try to remove him, Manohar Parrikar will not keep quiet, he will reveal all the secret information, important information, which can expose our Prime Minister,"" he claimed. Khera said the Congress has demanded that the Goa Governor convene a one-day special session, so that it can ask the government to prove majority. Wishing Parrikar a speedy recovery and long life, he said his ailment cannot be an impediment to the aspirations of the people of Goa, as people of the state want governance, administration and progress. ""Instead of taking Cabinet meetings in AIIMS Delhi, Parrikar should show moral righteousness and voluntarily step down from his post, and get ready for a floor test,"" he said. Khera alleged that the ""state is headless, governance is paralyzed, administration is crippled, there is complete breakdown of authority, rule of law has collapsed, people are feeling cheated with absolutely no policy and direction and Goa is in chaos"". Parrikar, who is undergoing treatment for a pancreatic ailment in New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), held meetings with party leaders as well as allies on Friday, 12 October, to discuss ways to ensure that his government functions normally. He is expected to shed ""many"" of his portfolios after Dussehra, according to ministers who met him. But Khere said, ""This desperate drama of holding a cabinet meeting in AIIMS and playing musical chairs with the portfolio of ministers is the last straw and is akin to rubbing salt on wounds of people of Goa."" In the 40-member state assembly, the Parrikar government has the support of 23 MLAs. These comprise 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and MGP as well as three Independents.

Sushovan Sircar,"Durga Puja is here, but there’s a HUGE debate that Bengalis are now embroiled in. Should the Mamata Banerjee government be giving out sops for Durga Puja? For the uninitiated, the West Bengal government, under CM Mamata Banerjee, had announced that it will give out Rs 28 crores, in total, to 28,000-odd Durga Puja committees in West Bengal. Essentially, that means each puja committee will get around Rs 10,000. Is that too much? Well, some citizens seems to think so. A petition was filed by advocate Sourav Datta at Calcutta High Court, challenging this decision on the grounds that there is “no public purpose” in organising a Durga Puja. On 10 October, Calcutta High Court rejected Datta’s PIL saying courts cannot interfere in an executive order. Datta, then, took his appeal to Supreme Court, which heard the matter on 12 October and refused to stay the Bengal goverment’s decision to dole out the money. The top court, however, did say it is willing to examine whether a state, by exercising its discretionary powers, can grant money to puja committees or clubs for religious activities. It also issued a notice to the Mamta Banerjee government and sought its reply within six weeks. Now, Durga Puja has never been exclusive of politics in West Bengal. It is the biggest festival in the state, and a lot of politicians hold stake in it, either by organising their own pujas or by some other means. It is the easiest and surest way to get into the hearts and minds of the Bengali voter. While it seems like the Bengal government has successfully crossed all hurdles when it comes to this move, we at  debate on whether it is fair for a “secular state” - ANY state - to be giving out money for religious festivals.

In an interview with   Sanjay Pugalia, Chidambaram said that they have no problem with private companies doing business in this country and that “the issue is very different in Rafale.” Chidambaram stressed that there should be a concrete reason for why the earlier MoU was cancelled, just as there is a proper reason why someone moves houses – a leak, for instance, or a neighbourhood which is not proper. Chidambaram pointed out that the Air Force needs seven squadrons – 126 aircraft, which Dassault is ready to sell. If the price is indeed 9-20 percent cheaper, as the government has claimed, then what is the reason for buying only 36 aircrafts? Chidambaram questioned why the government did not ask Dassault to choose HAL, especially since the latter has 70 years of experience and has built Sukhoi, Mirage, MiGs and now its own Tejas. Chidambaram also questioned how the defence minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) could say that she had no information about Dassault entering into an agreement with a private sector company, when on the same day that she met French Defence Minister Florence Parly, the latter flew to Nagpur to lay the foundation stone of an event attended by Mr Gadkari, Mr Fadnavis, the French ambassador to India and the chairman of Dassault.

The Quint,"Escalating his campaign against the Modi government over the Rafale deal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi Saturday accused it of destroying the state-run aerospace company HAL – which he termed as being India’s ""strategic asset"" – and told its employees that ""Rafale is your right."" Giving a new twist to his high-pitch Rafale campaign, Gandhi sought to reach out to present and former HAL employees, alleging that ""temples of modern India are being attacked and destroyed; we cannot allow it to be done."" The Congress president was speaking at the event held at Minsk Square near the HAL headquarters, after hearing the former and present employees. He said it was ""completely ridiculous"" for the government to say that HAL did not have the required experience. Gandhi told the gathering that he understood ""deeply"" that they were pained and hurt and ""this is as important to me as any corruption or anything that has happened."" The gravamen of most of the employees who spoke was that HAL had the capability to make Rafale, but an attempt was being made to ""dismantle"" the defence PSU and the workers feel ""hurt and let down,"" he said. Gandhi said the work done by HAL for the country was tremendous and the country owed a debt to it for ""protecting us"" and creating a scientific vision. Speaking to reporters after the event, Gandhi said Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman talked about lack of experience of HAL, but had said nothing about the lack of experience of Anil Ambani, ""who has been never built a plane in his life."" Gandhi demanded to know why the order was being taken away from HAL when it had all the experience. ""Why hasn't the work being given to them? Why is HAL being destroyed by Anil Ambani...that is the question.” He said the employees felt hurt over the fact that their hard work over the last 78 years, their patriotism, has been insulted and questioned by the government through the Defence Minister. ""So the first thing is that they expect an apology from the Defence Minister for insulting HAL. We understand that the Defence Minister is not going to apologise,"" he said. On alleged corruption, he said HAL was one of the ""modern temples"" of India and it was being destroyed ""because of corruption that Narendra Modi is doing to help Anil Ambani. Referring to the HAL interaction, he said: Ahead of Gandhi's interaction, HAL had issued an internal communication to its employees Friday, 12 October, as a reminder on their obligations on conduct and discipline in the interest of the company. The HAL employees union said an interaction was sought with the employees, but they decided to not take part as the union was apolitical. ""We got a communication from the Congress office, but we can't take sides for a political party, being government employees. Our union is an independent union, we are not affiliated to any political party,"" the union's general secretary Suryadevara Chandra Shekhar said. Karnataka state Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao said the discussion was not organised by Congress, but by ""some people"", including some ex-employees, who are ""pained"" by the government's attempts to ""ruin HAL's name"". Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, M Veerappa Moily, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara , former chief minister Siddaramaiah and Congress spokesman Jaipal Reddy were present at the interaction. The visit comes amid the ongoing developments in the Rafale deal, wherein Dassault Aviation has said that Reliance has a 10 percent offset in the deal for 36 Rafale jets. Karnataka unit Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao had earlier tweeted about Gandhi’s plans. Earlier in the day, Gandhi had tweeted saying there was a need to “defend the dignity of India's defenders” as he accused the Narendra Modi government of “snatching” the Rafale offset contract from HAL and “gifting” it to Anil Ambani's company. “HAL is India's strategic asset. The future of India's aerospace industry has been destroyed by snatching #Rafale from HAL & gifting it to Anil Ambani,” the Congress president tweeted. “Come defend the dignity of India's defenders. I am in Bengaluru to stand with HAL's employees. Join me outside HAL HQ, at 3 PM,” he added. Gandhi’s interaction is part of his onslaught against the Modi government over the Rafale deal with the Congress president alleging that HAL had been overlooked in the offsets contracts with French aerospace company Dassault Aviation preferring Anil Ambani’s company. The party has been accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of snatching jobs of the people of Karnataka by taking away the contract from HAL. Gandhi had been saying that had HAL been selected in place of Reliance Defence it could have generated employment for scores of unemployed youth in the state. However, the BJP and Reliance Defence have dismissed all the allegations as false. Modi had announced the procurement of 36 Rafale fighters after holding talks with then French President Francois Hollande on April 10, 2015, in Paris. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Avinash Kalla,"Split wide open – this explains the state of internal politics in the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and Congress in Rajasthan. Whosoever is able to manage this divide better has brighter chances of emerging victorious on 11 December 2018. Let’s begin with the ruling party. For over six months, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and BJP National President Amit Shah have been at loggerheads. It started with the removal of Raje’s loyalist Ashok Parnami as the state BJP president, and took 74 days to get a nondescript Madan Lal Saini to take over in July. She snubbed her detractors making it clear who the boss is in Rajasthan BJP. Ever since he took over, the new party president has been a mere ceremonial name, and is hardly seen with Raje. Take a look at this. Not just that, Shah was also not to be seen anywhere in the   other than making a symbolic presence during the flagging off. The  apart, the two have barely been seen together in rallies. Once the election dates were announced the BJP central leadership has sent Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Rajya Sabha MP Om Prakash Mathur to access the ground and form election strategy . Talk to party functionaries, and you’d know they are wondering as to who would call the shots when it comes to the selection of candidates. This is crucial for BJP and will decide its future. To make matters worse, recently Amit Shah announced that the district presidents of its units wouldn’t be contesting elections, causing much resentment. Many district leaders are miffed and have offered to resign in order to contest. In the BJP, despite this power struggle, they have gone ahead and declared Raje the chief ministerial candidate and on the face of it, the party is rallying behind her. She is calling the shots and is giving her all to beat the anti-incumbency. On the other hand, in the Congress, after three by-poll wins earlier this year, everyone from the foot-soldiers to the top-brass is sensing a victory, and is fancying their chances to make the most of the situation. The young Congress party chief Sachin Pilot, who has toiled and travelled across the state relentlessly for the last four and a half years, isn’t getting a similar backing of the old guard. Former CM Ashok Gehlot, despite having moved to New Delhi as AICC General Secretary, can’t seem to give up the desire to occupy 13, Civil Lines a third time. He, in the recent past, told scribes at a gathering that, for the last 10 years, there has been a clear figure before their eyes (namely, himself), so the question of a “CM face” doesn’t arise. At rallies Gehlot keeps saying that party workers should maintain the same tempo after ticket distribution, or that those who are left out will be accommodated. Pilot, to his credit, has maintained a politically correct position, stating that in case of victory, the elected MLAs and high command will decide the person for top position. Another challenge is that the party’s face is managing aspirations of ticket seekers. Facing paucity of funds, selecting a ‘winning face’ would be an uphill task for the young party chief. With elections scheduled for 7 December, it would be a challenge for the Congress party to keep the flock together and maintain the momentum, whereas the BJP election machinery will try its best to find a chink in the Congress’s armour. Let’s see who is able to hold down the fort.         (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Anubhav Mishra," Purnendu Pritam  Prabuddha Jain (Are the ‘achhe din’ here for villages adopted by PM Modi's star MPs? Watch  ’s ground reports from villages adopted under the 'Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana’ (SAGY)) . On 11 October 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) to commemorate the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan – a leader associated with ‘Sampurn Kranti’ (total revolution) against the Congress party. The aim of the programme was that each Member of Parliament will ‘adopt’ at least three villages in their constituency and develop them into ‘adarsh gram’ or model villages by 2019. Prime Minister Modi adopted Jayapur village under the programme on 7 November 2014. This will be the sixth village in  series named ‘Our MP’s Village: Achhe Din?’ We earlier reported on  ,  ,  ,   and  ’s villages. The objective of SAGY was that MPs cater to the needs of their adopted villages and work towards their holistic development. Some of the goals that the MPs were to achieve under SAGY are:  tried to determine how many of these objectives have been achieved. When you arrive in Jayapur, you can see a bank. The village even has roads constructed all across it, and in the lanes, you will find bricked roads. Street lights powered by solar cell panels can also be seen. However, a closer look shows that all’s not as shiny as it seems. Even the village headman agrees that a rushed job was done, and hence, the roads that were built are now in need to be repaired. “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” and “Digital India” have been two of the most popular slogans associated with Prime Minister Modi. Hence, it was no surprise when it was announced that Jayapur would get smart classes. What surprised us was that there was no electricity connection for the school. Solar panels were installed in the school but the locals said their batteries had been stolen, and without the batteries, those panels were of little use to the school administration. The locals allege that the authorities didn’t utilise the funds that were sent to them for the development of the village. Another resident, Ramraj, claims that Dalit colonies got the shorter end of the stick when it comes to development schemes. Under the SAGY programme, one MP was supposed to adopt three villages till 2019 and the first adopted village was to be made ‘adarsh’ by 2016. It has been four years since Jayapur was adopted by the prime minister. It has seen it’s fair share of promises, funding and announcements. But most of them still remain unfulfilled.

This is not the first time that Tharoor has left Twitter users in India scratching their heads with long-winding and not-so-common words. In December 2017, he used the word ‘rodomontade’, meaning boastful or inflated talk or behaviour. In February this year, he had tweeted the word ‘troglodytes’ in a response to Vinay Katiyar's comment on the Taj Mahal. The word left Twitter users amused, with many taking to the social networking platform to express their amusement and cracking jokes about Tharoor’s newest gift to the Twitterati. The outbreak of amusement and confusion led Tharoor to respond on Twitter on 11 October, apologising and adding another word. Tharoor’s latest challenge resulted in many parents trying to make their children pronounce the word and tweet videos. Young children joined the game, attempting to pronounce the word. Surprisingly, many of them nailed it as well! Tharoor replied to these efforts, appreciating them and their precociousness. Tharoor himself responded to the new trend, acknowledging the efforts of the children and apologising for “doing this to the young.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

PTI,"Dassault Aviation's joint venture with Reliance represents around 10 percent of the offset investments under the Rafale jet deal, Dassault CEO Eric Trappier has said. ""We're in talks with about 100 Indian firms, including around 30 with which we've already confirmed partnerships,"" Trappier told AFP. Separately on Thursday, 11 October, speaking at a briefing in Paris, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the government's claim that it had no idea that Dassault Aviation would team up with Reliance Group, run by Anil Ambani. Several reports say Dassault was forced to choose Reliance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite the latter having almost no experience in the aviation sector. On the eve of Sitharaman's visit, French investigative website Mediapart quoted the notes of a meeting between Dassault management and workers' representatives, which described the choice of Reliance as ""imperative and compulsory"". In a statement, Dassault released a transcript of what it said was Trappier's   with AFP in which he was asked about the status of the offsets. ""Signing an offset contract is a requirement of Indian law (Defence Procurement Procedure). The implementation of offsets is an obligation and, under the Indian regulation, the choice of the partners belongs to us,” Trappier was quoted as saying. He said what is called “offset” in English is usually translated into French as “compensation” or “contrepartie”. With regard to the staff and trades union organisations, Dassault Aviation uses the term “obligation contractuelle d'offset” or “obligation contractuelle de compensation”, he said. Dassault negotiated for years with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the order, with the jets being jointly built in India. But those talks were cancelled after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, when he decided to purchase the jets directly from France. Asked why Dassault chose Reliance over HAL as its partner, Trappier said Dassault Aviation decided to establish a long-term presence in India through DRAL, a joint enterprise in which governance is provided by an Indian Chief Executive Officer and a French Chief Operating Officer. Dassault on Wednesday had said it had ""freely chosen"" to form a joint venture with Reliance. But that stance was contradicted recently by former French president Francois Hollande, under whose watch the Rafale deal was signed. Hollande said last month that France had ""no choice"" but to join with Reliance after it was pushed by the Indian government – comments which were seized upon by Indian Ppposition parties. Under Indian defence procurement rules, foreign companies winning contracts must ""offset"" or reinvest half the total value – in this case around eight billion euros – in joint ventures or purchases with Indian firms.

According to sources, around 60 I-T officials have also landed up at his home in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district. The businessman-politician was reported to be the promoter of Rithwik Projects Pvt Ltd. Speaking to a local media outlet, Ramesh said the searches were a 'witch hunt'. He said he had issued a notice, as a member of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), to the I-T department last week regarding the series of searches that they had done across the state. This comes one week after the premises of Nellore-based businessman and politician Beeda Masthan Rao of the TDP were also searched. Masthan is a close aide of party chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. According to reports, I-T sleuths from Chennai had conducted searches on BMR Groups, a shrimp farming and exports firm where Beeda Masthan Rao is the chairman. According to reports, the searches were carried out by 34 ED officials on Monday night. They seized several documents and rubber stamps. Chowdary had founded the Sujana Group of Industries. Speculation within the TDP also suggested that these I-T raids were part of ‘Operation Garuda’, a claim reinforced by Naidu in June this year. The theory of the operation was first put forward by actor Sivaji, who was earlier with the BJP. Last year, in a viral video, he alleged that the BJP was launching 'Operation Garuda' with the help of Jagan and Pawan in Andhra Pradesh to finish off the TDP in Andhra Pradesh. In the video, Sivaji claimed that the new party led by one 'Kalyan ji' and the regional party will join hands and defeat the major local party in 2019, following which the national party will put its plan into action. Sivaji claimed that the 'new party' chief would be offered the post of a union minister, while the head of the regional party would be sent to jail for existing cases that he is fighting in court, following which a Telugu leader from the national party would take charge.

Demanding a probe against PM Modi, Gandhi said on Thursday: The Congress president also questioned Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's trip to France, alleging it is part of a huge government ""cover-up"" on Rafale. Giving details of the internal document from Dassault, Mediapart said in its report: The report also detailed how a site in Nagpur, meant to manufacture parts for the Rafale jets, ""remains largely unbuilt"". On 21 September, former French President Francois Hollande had told the same media house that France was not given an option of choosing a local partner for Dassault Aeronautics. Hollande had added that it was the Indian government which had proposed Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence. The Congress had earlier demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in the Rafale deal but it was rejected by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

The statement by Hollande triggered demands from opposition parties in India for an investigation. He reiterated his statement, to AFP, when he said, “Reliance Group had appeared as part of a ‘new formula’ in negotiations over the Rafale deal, decided by the Modi government after it came to power.” Hitting out at the Congress, Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said, ""The government negotiated terms which are far better than what was agreed to by UPA in 2007 and 2012."" In an apparent dig at Gandhi, Goyal said, ""We have been experiencing the activities of a serial liar."" On Thursday, the BJP accused Gandhi of mocking national security and said he is trying to build his political career by spreading lies on the Rafale fighter jet deal. His family earned money from every defence deal that took place before 2014, Patra alleged, adding that Gandhi and his party had jeopardised the defence of the country. He has been lying and mocking national security, the BJP spokesperson added. Now, the people of the country will decide who to believe in, the air chief marshal or Gandhi, Patra added. Earlier on Wednesday, the Congress had accused the Modi government of ""manipulating"" the process of Rafale fighter jet agreement by ""punishing"" bureaucrats who raised objections to the deal and rewarding ""obliging officials"", as Gandhi raised questions on Sitharaman's France visit. Taking to Twitter, Gandhi alleged that ""work has begun"" to justify the prime minister's decision to buy Rafale fighter aircraft.

After going through the highlights posted on the ABP website, I am still clueless as to how the magic figure of 276 for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was arrived at. What are the constituents of the United Progressive Alliance other than the Congress? Have JD (S), TDP, NCP, RJD, Left parties, TMC or DMK been considered as the allies of the Congress and hence, part of the UPA? All that we are made to believe is that the NDA is expected to get 276 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. The survey also indicates marginal erosion in the NDA’s vote share and a perceptible dip in the prime minister’s popularity, from 69 percent in 2017 to 60 percent now. The survey findings, however, have left many questions unanswered. The current ABP-CVoter survey suggests that irrespective of what happens in the Assembly elections, the BJP is going to do exceedingly well in Lok Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Past data suggests that this has not been the case in the three states. Why should we assume that we will have a trend reversal in 2019?

Akanksha Kumar,"Union Minister and BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan’s victory from Pallahara constituency in the 2000 Assembly elections had   Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. That victory marked the foray of the saffron party in the state that holds the key to 21 Lok Sabha seats and thus, is crucial for the incumbent government at the Centre. In the book,   by Juggernaut publications, senior journalist and editor of the   magazine, Ruben Banerjee looks at Patnaik’s political trajectory as he went on to hold the reins as chief minister for four successive terms. The book was launched in Delhi on 10 October 2018, followed by a conversation with former BJD leader Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda. Talking about his decision to quit the party he was a part of for more than fifteen years, Jay Panda said “he got disillusioned in the last five years.” Senior journalist Ruben Banerjee, who has followed the politics of Naveen Patnaik since last two decades, described him as a ‘master strategist’. Talking about his personal ties with Patnaik, Panda said it was in 2017 when he decided to call it quits. Panda also said no one from the party, including Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, had turned up to pay their last respects to his father, Bansidhar Panda, in May this year. The former Kendrapara MP told the audience how his father had bailed out Patnaik and his family when they were dealing with a financial crisis. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Shruthi Ramakrishnan,"A sex offender registry refers to a government database containing information on convicted sex offenders. In India, this database is maintained by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and contains information such as the name, residential address, Aadhaar number, fingerprints and even DNA samples of the offenders. These registries are propositioned as mechanisms that will not only aid the law enforcement agencies to keep track of known offenders, but also help investigate offences, suspected to having been committed by a former offender. However, a close look at this registry reveals that the potential of these registries may largely be misplaced – and is not the quick-fix it promises to be. At present, the registry does not have any legislative basis and is an executive action. Consequently, the operational mechanics of this registry remains largely unclear. In India however, there is no such requirement. The NCRB unilaterally maintains the list with relevant information and it is unclear how the NCRB plans to keep the information updated and keep tabs on the activities of more than 4 lakh offenders currently on the registry. The name of a sex offender enters the register upon the conviction of the said offender. If the offender chooses to appeal his conviction, his name remains on the register until the conviction is overturned on the appeal. The retention of the name of such offenders poses serious questions of constitutionality especially given the lack of a legislative grounding for such a decision. The foremost concern posed by the registry is the possibility of it being open to the public. While presently the register is only accessible to law enforcement agencies, the possibility of a public registry remains a troubling possibility. The Minister of Women and Child Development has in the previous year, pitched the need for a public registry. While eight other countries also have such registries, they are generally closed to the public. Departing from this trend, the USA has had public notification of sex offender registries since the late 1990s. As a consequence, former offenders not only face social stigma and harassment, but also face a large number of restrictions and find it challenging to secure employment. Foremost, it must be noted that only convicted sex offenders are added to the registry and consequently, the most severe limitation of the registry is that its potential in addressing sexual crimes is limited to crimes committed by repeat offenders. It is interesting to note that the registry also includes DNA samples and fingerprints of former offenders, making it easier to cross-verify the forensic samples collected at a scene of crime when a repeat offence is suspected. This advantage must however again be appreciated in light of the fact that these offences probably constitute a minority of the sexual offences in the country. While general figures of recidivism are available, there are unfortunately no figures on the rates of recidivism specifically amongst sexual offenders to gauge the risk that this particular group poses and warrant the extensive financial and infrastructural investment that this registry will require to function. The addressing of sexual crimes require much more attention at the ground level with immediate need to improve the working of investigative agencies, police prosecution and courts. Equally important is the need to work on preventive strategies and tackle the factors that lead to increased vulnerability of women and children to sexual crimes.

Shadab Moizee,"Mohd Irshad Alam Have you heard of Kanshi Ram? “Yes. He’s our hero. He fought for the rights of Dalits. He founded the Bahujan Samaj Party. He took the mission of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar forward and taught us to live by his values. Due to his support, Mayawati became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh four times. You are talking to me today because of him, otherwise our voice would have been suppressed long back.” All of this was said in one breath by 17-year-old Rahul. While he was speaking rapidly, I threw a breaker in the form of another question. Do you know Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’? The response was immediate – “he’s our brother.” Kanshi Ram’s 12th death anniversary fell on 9 October 2018. When Rahul was asked about Kanshi Ram’s death anniversary, he said he forgot the date. But he immediately changed his response, saying that the day had passed recently. He had seen it on television but couldn’t remember when. Rahul is presently studying in Saharanpur’s Janta Inter-College. The eldest of four brothers and sisters, he is a fan of the Bhim Army and Chandrashekhar. He considers himself a member of the Bhim Army. Lakhnaur village lies between Deoband and Saharanpur. There is a temple dedicated to Sant Ravidas here. On the temple grounds, Rahul and some children from the area are enthusiastically shouting slogans of ‘Jai Bhim’.

He is the messiah of the Bahujans, the Dalits. If he does fight the elections, we will support him. Mayawati will come later.

The central probe agency issued a provisional order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for attachment of Indian assets in Kodaikanal and Ooty in Tamil Nadu and a flat in Delhi's Jorbagh. A cottage and house in Somerset in UK and a tennis club located in Barcelona, Spain have also been attached as part of the same order, the agency said. Fixed deposits worth Rs 90 lakh, kept in a bank in Chennai, in the name of Advantage Strategic Consulting Private Limited (ASCPL) have also been attached, it said. The assets are in the name of Karti and ASCPL, the firm allegedly linked to him. ""The attached assets collectively amount to Rs 54 crore,"" it said.

The Quint," Mohd Irshad Alam  Sarthak Goswami In a recent address to the media, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had called Sir Chhotu Ram “an inspiration for future generations.” On 9 October, Haryana saw a 64-foot-tall statue of this little-known farmers’ leader unveiled, at his native village Garhi Sampla in Rohtak district. Chhotu Ram is regarded as a champion of farmers’ rights during the British colonial era. A well-regarded politician in the Punjab Province, he served as its development minister after the provincial Assembly elections of 1937. These were the Punjab Relief Indebtness Act, 1934, and The Punjab Debtors' Protection Act, 1936, which included   for debt settlement boards, caps on interest, and ensuring basic rights to the farmer. An illustration of his commitment to principles was an incident in which Chhotu Ram's wife had apparently asked an Indian Civil Services officer, SK Kirpalani, for helping out her son-in-law by getting him a promotion in government employment. Kirpalani recounts Chhotu Ram's reaction to this: He led a rather simple life and used to set aside a significant portion of his salary for a school in Rohtak. Even today, Chhotu Ram is said to be a revered figure in Haryana's Jat community. The Jat community, which makes up about 25 percent of Haryana's voter base, has largely been considered to be  to the BJP. The event is also seen as an attempt to keep Chhotu Ram’s grandson, Chaudhary Birender Singh, pleased with the party. Birender was, till July 2016, in charge of the Panchayati Raj, Rural Development, and Drinking Water and Sanitation portfolios in the Modi cabinet. Thereafter, he was made the Union Steel Minister.

Akanksha Kumar,"Purnendu Pritam and Ashutosh Bharadwaj When 68-year-old Kanchan Devi, Chittorgarh resident Bhagwan Giri’s wife, met with an accident last year, the family rushed her to Fortis Hospital in Udaipur. There was, however, more bad news to come. Giri was informed that he won’t be allowed to avail cashless treatment under Bhamashah Yojana, a scheme started by the Rajasthan government in 2015, that provides an insurance cover of Rs 3 lakhs to BPL families. Giri’s family then took Kanchan Devi to Pacific Hospital in Udaipur, where she breathed her last. Had Kanchan Devi received proper treatment in time, she may have survived. It’s this gnawing thought that doesn’t let Bhagwan Giri sleep in peace. Showing an array of documents that he has compiled carefully in Kanchan Devi’s ‘discharge file’, Giri keeps pointing towards the Bhamashah card that was made in his wife’s name. Being a Bhamashah card holder meant that Giri’s family had an insurance cover of Rs 3 lakh. Yet, they had to bear Kanchan Devi’s medical expenses on their own. So, what went wrong, one might ask. When   contacted Fortis Hospital in Udaipur, we were told that the hospital was not covered under Bhamashah Yojana until February this year. Lack of awareness is just one of the problems associated with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje’s dream project on public health. In Chittorgarh’s Aral village, several families belonging to the BPL category complain that they were asked to pay for medical bills by private hospitals. When Nanalal Sen went for the treatment of his older brother, Ghisulal, who had suffered a heart attack, he was asked to pay Rs 13,000. When   contacted Udaipur-based Pacific Hospital, the concerned person at the Bhamashah department refused to comment on this particular case. However, he did clarify that the cardiology package, which includes heart ailments, is available at the hospital. When Ramudi Bai, a resident of Chittorgarh’s Bassi village, fell ill earlier this year, she was admitted to Bhilwara’s Siddhi Vinayak Hospital. Here, her treatment for typhoid cost Ramudi Bai Rs 30,000. Ramudi Bai had to give her land on lease to clear the hospital bill of Rs 30, 000. With Bhamashah beneficiaries being denied cashless treatment, activists now fear that the newly-launched Ayushman Bharat scheme by the Modi government will create more problems. In September 2018, the New India Assurance Company, a PSU walked out of Bhamashah Yojana, as the Rajasthan government had failed to pay a premium of Rs 107 crore. Frauds, delay in the payment of premium and five-fold increase in the number of claims, these have been some of the problems associated with Bhamashah Yojana. An abysmal track record of the scheme certainly doesn’t bode well for the state government in an election year. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Addressing party workers in Maner on the outskirts of Patna, Bharti asked them to give up bickering and stay united. “We are not lacking in support base. The challenge is to keep our flock together,” she added. However, Bharti later claimed that her call for unity among party workers was presented in a distorted manner. Taking to Twitter she said: ""My appeal to party workers to forget their differences and unite in the larger interest of the party is being distorted and presented out of context,"" she tweeted. Maner falls in the Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat from where Bharti had made an unsuccessful electoral debut in 2014. She got elected to the Rajya Sabha later. ""The time has come for you all to give up small differences and brace for the bigger challenges and do not give our opponents a chance to exploit the situation,"" she said.

The News Minute,"Four police officers, including intel chief KN Sathyamoorthy, have been named in a new statement issued by Apollo Hospital in Chennai, regarding the death of the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. A five-page affidavit was submitted by Apollo Hospital to the inquiry commission conducting a probe into the former chief minister’s hospitalisation. The hospital claims that the four officers, who were part of her security detail at the time, controlled both surveillance around Jayalalithaa’s treatment at Apollo as well as the release of information to the public. Since the late chief minister’s passing on 5 December 2016, many have raised questions over the events surrounding her hospitalisation and death. Following this, a one-man commission, led by retired Justice Arumugam, was established by the state government to conduct a probe into her death. “I submit that during her hospitalisation, the personal security of the late chief minister was overseen by her own personal security detail, which included the police, Mr K. N. Sathyamoorthy, Mr Sudhaker, Mr R Veeraperumal, and Mr S Perumalsamy. The entire second floor was under their surveillance. They also provided surveillance when the late Chief Minister had to be moved out of the second floor for the purpose of CT scans or other procedures,” according to S.M. Mohan Kumar, the legal representative for Apollo, on behalf of the hospital. The affidavit further goes on to assert that the hospital’s CCTV cameras in its corridors were shut off when Jayalalithaa was being moved to different parts of the hospital, at the request of Sathyamoorthy, Sudhaker, Veeraperumal, and Perumalsamy. The statement further alleges that the press releases which the government had released during the stay of the former chief minister were incomplete. The government strictly controlled all information which was being given to the public, though hospital authorities had briefed the government daily on the exact status of Jayalalithaa, the affidavit reads. “Although, the government was briefed by the hospital on the late CM’s health condition on a daily basis, the press statements released by them do not contain the complete and detailed version of the late CM’s day-to-day health condition since it was within their discretion what information to share with the public and not.

Aviral Virk,"The dates are out! Madhya Pradesh will vote for its next chief minister on 28 November. The results will be declared on 11 December, the Election Commission announced on Saturday, 6 October. Here’s a look at the key factors for the Congress and the BJP in the state:   The Congress will have to consolidate its lead in the bypolls and the municipality elections. The Congress won Kolaras by a margin of 8,000 votes, and Mungaoli by a narrow margin of 2,000. In August, the party won nine out of 14 municipal seats, snatching three from the BJP.   The BJP has been in power in Madhya Pradesh for the last 15 years. Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been the chief minister of the state for 13 of those 15 years. Reports of corruption – the Vyapam and the e-tender scam – have dented the party and the chief minister’s image.   The Congress’ traditional vote base in the state, has over time eroded and divided up between the BJP and the BSP. To win them back, Surendra Choudhary, a Dalit, has been appointed as the secretary in charge of the state. It is speculated that if the Congress wins, the Choudhary could be elected deputy chief minister. The BJP will bank on its ability to organise itself on the ground and on the RSS’ work to sail home to victory. Like Modi, Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s image has been cast as a pro-development leader. ‘ The anti-Congress propaganda includes a warning to the people about Congress leader Digvjaya Singh’s tenure as chief minister which was synonymous with bad roads and lack of electricity. The BJP is set to project its development indices and pro-farmer budget to boost its election campaign. A huge mandate for the Congress has been predicted in the pre-poll surveys conducted so far. The ABP-CVoter opinion poll has predicted a 117/230 seat win for the Congress. Currently, the BJP has 165 MLAs in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly and the Congress occupies 58 seats.

Pompeo and Kim also discussed “denuclearisation steps that will be taken by North Korea and the issue of attendance by the US government,” as well as “corresponding measures” to be taken by the US, the statement said. The visit was Pompeo's fourth to North Korea. ""We continue to make progress on agreements made at Singapore Summit. Thanks for hosting me and my team,"" Pompeo tweeted. Kim also praised their ""nice meeting"", telling Pompeo via an interpreter following the morning's talks that it was ""a very nice day that promises a good future for both countries."" Since the Singapore summit, the road towards warmer ties has been bumpy. Washington and Pyongyang have sparred over the exact terms of the vaguely-worded agreement in Singapore, with the US pushing to maintain sanctions and pressure against the North until its ""final, fully verified denuclearisation"". After a previous visit to Pyongyang in July, Pompeo had said the two foes made progress on key issues – but within hours of his departure the North condemned “gangster-like” demands from the US, raising questions over how much the two sides really saw eye to eye. Another planned trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang was scrapped after what Trump said was insufficient progress towards implementing the terms of the Singapore declaration. An official on Sunday's latest visit to Pyongyang with Pompeo said the trip was ""better than the last time"", but added: ""It's going to be a long haul."" Following his arrival in Seoul from Pyongyang on Sunday, Pompeo said at a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in that he had ""a good productive conversation"" with Kim, in talks which represented ""another step forward"". “I hope your trip to North Korea and the upcoming second US-North Korea summit will provide a good opportunity for achieving irreversible, decisive progress in terms of denuclearisation and the peace process on the Korean peninsula.” Analysts say Washington may now consider new options as China, Russia and South Korea seek to relax sanctions. ""North Korea took some steps towards denuclearisation and the US will face criticism from the international community if it continues to demand complete denuclearisation without any lifting of sanctions,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. ""We can’t rule out the possibility that Washington may move in the direction of partial easing of sanctions based on progress in denuclearisation,"" he said. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has given a hint of what a grand bargain between the two countries could look like. In an interview with the Washington Post, she said the North could agree to dismantle Yongbyon, its signature nuclear site. After Seoul, Pompeo ends his trip on Monday in China, North Korea's political and economic lifeline. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The SP's snub to the Congress comes just days after Mayawati ruled out any alliance between the BSP and the Congress for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh during Assembly elections. This move, which could take a hit at the opposition’s efforts to form an anti-BJP front before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Time is passing by and we cannot wait any longer,” Akhilesh Yadav told reporters on the sidelines of a party event.

Mayawati had claimed that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi wanted an alliance but some ""selfish” senior leaders in their party were out to foil any understanding. Reacting to Mayawati's statement, Akhilesh Yadav had then urged the Congress to show large-heartedness by taking along other parties.

PTI,"NCP president Sharad Pawar will not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, party leader Jitendra Ahwad said on 6 October, Saturday. Putting to rest speculations that Pawar will contest from Pune Lok Sabha seat, Ahwad told reporters that Pawar had already made it clear in 2014 that he will not contest the Lok Sabha polls again. Awhad also denied that the NCP chief had opposed the candidature of Parth Pawar, son of senior leader Ajit Pawar, for the Mawal Lok Sabha seat. The former Union Agriculture minister is currently holding a two-day meeting with NCP leaders and functionaries at the party's state unit office to discuss candidates for the LS polls scheduled for next year. The meeting started on the morning of 6 October. In another development, former Maharashtra NCP chief Sunil Tatkare told reporters that he was willing to step aside if Bhaskar Jadhav, another former state party chief, was keen to contest from Raigad Lok Sabha seat. Tatkare had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Raigad against Shiv Sena leader Anant Geete. Geete is the the Heavy Industries Minister in the Narendra Modi government. The NCP has demanded a 50-50 seat-sharing formula for the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats in its alliance talks with the Congress. The two parties had entered into an alliance in 2014 and the Congress contested 27 seats while the NCP put up candidates on 21 LS seats.

PTI,"A government toll-free number for reporting child sexual assault cases has been suspended temporarily after it appeared in pornographic content search, and calls seeking sexual services were received, a senior NCPCR official has said. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights officer said an alternative number has been launched, even as the commission tries to put the suspended number back into operation. The helpline number operated under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act has been de-funct since September. ""It started receiving lewd calls every day following which we suspended it temporarily,"" the officer said. He said that based on conversations with the callers, it was found that they dialed the helpline after finding the number when they searched for pornographic content online. An alternative number has been made available in addition to the Childline number of 1098 to report such cases, he said. NCPCR member Yashwant Jain said a police complaint has been lodged and the apex child rights body has been in touch with state-owned telecom service provider MTNL to find a solution. The helpline was started in 2016 as part of the ""e-box"" initiative of the Women and Child Development Ministry to enable filing of complaints of sexual offences against children. However, in the last two years, the portal has received just 104 complaints out of which 54 have been addressed, he said. The reason behind the poor response to the number is reluctance of people to report cases of sexual abuse and even if the child wants to report the parents have reservations, the official said. ""This is evident from the number of hits that the page has got (till August 26). It was recorded at 2,836,"" Jain added. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Revati Laul,"“Look, there’s Theresa May, dancing at a Tory party conference. This is deeply embarrassing,” said my British friend C, as we made our way around the hills of Uttarakhand, in and around Mukhteshwar. We YouTubed it. The clip begins with the ABBA song ‘Dancing Queen’ playing in the background. Adoring MPs from the conservative Tory party clap and stand up, as the British Prime Minister with a tight face and tighter blue jacket enters stage right, swaying to the song. The blue background had the word “Opportunity” printed large. My friend snorted and said May was doing this jig because there was a joke going around Great Britain that the PM works on auto-pilot and takes no decisions. “May Bot” is the moniker she had to shake off by turning into a dancing queen.  Five and a half thousand kilometres away, at the UN headquarters in New York, the US President delivered another fantastic YouTube moment. He tried to defend the person he nominated to the Supreme Court – Brett Kavanaugh, currently being investigated by the FBI on charges of sexual assault. In the preamble of his defence, Trump rolled out in a classic Trump drawl, “In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” His listeners – delegates of the UN – laughed, as if this wasn’t the UN but a sitcom, and Trump was the ace deliverer of laughable lines. And then Trump tried to bend fact into funny fiction by claiming that he intended this to be a laugh-out-loud moment all along. Back home, our own MPs and election-hopefuls are rolling out the entertainment like that is what they are being paid for. At last count, the RSS claimed it loves Muslims at a press conference in Delhi and Congress Party President Rahul Gandhi said he is a Ram  . The saffronites are putting on a liberal attire and the faux liberals are wearing Hindu orange. And the crossed aesthetics are giving us all a fright. But as we discovered, they are also the perfect setting to renew our faith in dissidence, in all things ‘urban naxal’, to imagine a world that is a little less ridiculous, one day and task at a time. I will explain. Let’s start with N and her husband who moved here eight years ago. With one question on their minds – why do they have to consume so much in order to be? Is there a way out, a way to reduce the consumption and the politics it spawns? They think there is. Tucked away behind a jungle of oak and pine trees is their mud house. A large and ridiculous witch sways on her broomstick in the window in their drawing room. She is a mobile sculpture from Prague. N is a traveller with many lives, many wicked plots on broomsticks. The best of them is her getaway from a life of over-consumption and she draws you into that conversation in every choice she has made. The kind of house she has built. The choice to earn frugally and spend time volunteering with an organisation called Waste Warriors that is cleaning up the piles of garbage in the hills, one village at a time. And that’s where the cliché ends. It isn’t a simple village life. Living in the hills is hard work. She and her husband cook and clean. They don’t buy a new phone every year; they get their old ones repaired. They put up with long hours of no electricity and an unpredictable water supply. But they are happy. And it was palpable. The ‘infection’ spread and left C and I wondering about the tension between the city and the villages in the hills. Are the clever people who have moved away adding to the ruination of the hills? Not N and her husband, we said. It all depends on the choices you make – the politics you make or unmake in the market you choose to be in or disrupt a little. But the hills didn’t bend our minds only in the conversations we had with people like us. It was equally in the choices we saw the people who had always lived in those villages make and the migrants that came in seasonally. A migrant family from Chittorgarh in Rajasthan reminded us about the two-way conversation that has always happened between hills and plains, rural and urban, migrants and settlers. This was a family of   – metal workers. They set out from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh at the start of the year, where they make sickles for people to cut wheat with. The next season they shift to Haldwani in Uttarakhand and then to villages around Mukhteshwar. “My in-laws are from Delhi. From the Azadpur   area,” the woman with six kids said, as she sharpened her  . They were removing rust from a clutch of sickles for 20 rupees each. “We like the metro, but we don’t ever want to live in that city. We prefer the hills,” she said, and her children echoed her sentiment. Her husband stood smiling, his shirt open and his and her names tattooed on his chest. “It’s a custom we have when we marry; we tattoo each other’s names on our bodies,” he explained and showed us his name on his wife’s wrist. She smiled. C asked me to tell her he thought her Rajasthani   were beautiful. The woman smiled and flirted right back with C. “We have such exquisite jewellery in Rajasthan. The  , the  , the  , the anklets, the bangles. If I wore all of it, no one would be able to work. They’d just stop and stare at me,” she said laughing – owning her rural-ness and subversiveness. When your ego is diminished and bent out of shape by the hills, you can ask yourself what precisely it is that you do in the city and whether it adds to the skyline of plastic and pollution and sitcom politics. And how it might be possible to put a few oak trees in people’s way and ask them if they need that big fancy car. Or the new phone.And if some ridiculous mad laughter from on top of a hillside is more interesting consumption than Theresa May doing an ABBA for her party colleagues.  ‘ ’,    (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The News Minute,"Hours after rebel AMMK MLA TTV Dhinakaran labelled Tamil Nadu deputy CM a ‘double-faced’ politician,  who wanted to join the Sasikala faction, O Panneerselvam told the media this is all a “plot” by TTV Dhinakaran to create confusion. Rejecting TTV's allegations, O Panneerselvam said that he had no plans of becoming the chief minister. TTV Dhinakaran had alleged that O Panneerselvam had met him in July 2017, proposing a plan to oust Edapadi Palaniswami. The meeting had been arranged by a common friend, TTV alleged. At the press conference, OPS did not deny the meeting but claimed that he did not meet to hatch a plan against Edapadi Palaniswami. “I am continuing my dharmayudham to keep Sasikala’s family out from both the party and the government. I met him (TTV Dhinakaran) only after our common friend arranged a meeting. I thought he might have changed but he is continuing with low-level politics. That friend who had arranged the meeting apologised to me saying that it was the biggest mistake of his life,” Panneerselvam added. Suspended AIADMK MLA Thangatamil Selvan had earlier stated that O Panneerselvam had met with TTV Dhinkaran last year, ahead of his merger with the EPS faction. But minister Thangamani denied this allegation almost immediately and said that TTV Dhinakaran was attempting to stir controversy ahead of the bypolls in Thirupurakundram and Tiruvarur. He further claimed that it was TTV who tried to initiate merger talks with the AIADMK and was angry because this was not fruitful. Responding to Thangamani's claim, TTV Dhinakaran launched a tirade on Friday, 5 October, alleging that OPS was hungry for power. ""Last year, a few days after I came out of Tihar jail (3 June), our brother 'amaidhippadai' (silent army) Panneerselvam wanted to meet me and sent this message through a mutual close friend. I consulted with our MLAs about this interest expressed by OPS for a meeting. I didn't want to meet him, but after my men told me to go, I obliged and met him,"" revealed TTV Dhinakaran. ""In that meeting, OPS told me that he had committed a mistake and that whatever he spoke before was wrong. He said that he jumped the gun and also told me that he will consult with his men and join with us to oppose Edappadi. I also agreed to that. This happened on 12 July 2017,"" he added.

PTI,"Interpol president Meng Hongwei has been detained in China for questioning as part of an investigation against him, a media report said on Saturday, 6 October, a day after he was reported missing in his native country. Meng, 64, the first Chinese head of the international law enforcement agency headquartered in France, was ""taken away"" for questioning by discipline authorities ""as soon as he landed in China"" last week, Hong Kong-based   quoted a source as saying. It was not immediately clear why he is being investigated or exactly where he is being held. Meng, who is also a vice-minister at China's Ministry of Public Security, is under investigation in China, the Post reported amid mystery surrounding his disappearance after his wife reported to the French police that he had gone missing. The French police said on Friday that they have launched a probe for Meng after being contacted by his wife. Interpol, which is based in Lyon, said on Friday that it was aware of reports of Meng's ""alleged disappearance and that the issue was a matter for the relevant authorities in France and China. Meng was last seen in France on 29 September, according to reports from France. So far, neither the public security ministry nor the foreign ministry in China has commented. Under China's supervision law, a suspect's family and employer must be notified within 24 hours of detention, except in cases where doing so would hinder an investigation. It appears Meng's wife was not informed. Reports quoted an unnamed French judicial official as saying that Meng arrived in China at the end of September but there had been no news of him since. While Meng is listed on the website of China's Ministry of Public Security as a vice-minister, he lost his seat on its Communist Party Committee -- its real decision-making body -- in April, the Post reported. According to his own page on the site, Meng's last official engagement was on 23 August, when he met Lai Chung Han, a second permanent secretary of Singapore, it said. Meng was appointed the head of Interpol in 2016. His appointment also sparked concern about China extending its crackdown on dissidents abroad. He is due to serve until 2020.

Raghav Bahl,"Mohd Ibrahim  Shohini Bose  Abhay Sharma I was roasted by Modi’s fans when I called his government the most   and   since liberalisation, that is, in the last quarter century. But seeing Modi’s fuel folly over the last 24 hours, I feel vindicated, but also mighty sad, because with one, unthinking stroke, the government rolled back a reform that took years of courage to construct. Here are the facts: What would you call this government decision? An honest mistake, an oversight committed without realising the downstream consequences? No sir, I don’t think the Modi regime deserves this benefit of doubt. In my mind, this just confirms what I’ve asserted before:  . Narendra Modi was Napoleon’s proverbial “lucky general”, the first to enjoy a single-party majority after India freed its economy in 1991. His fortune was compounded when Brent crude collapsed from $108 per barrel in 2014 to $30 per barrel in 2016. His government got a windfall gain of nearly Rs 7 lakh crore, or $100 billion, over three years. Just imagine if it had gifted this largesse to consumers by cutting fuel prices at the pump? What a tax stimulus it would have been for private demand and corporate investment. Or if Modi had used the $100 billion war-chest to create a TARP-like(*) facility for stressed banks and infrastructure companies? With one stroke that would have solved our “twin balance sheet problem”, unlocking the fetters on growth. Instead, Modi doubled, even trebled, the taxes on oil to soak up the bonanza; and made the problem worse by spending it on grand welfare programmes that are notoriously inefficient and leaky. Modi continued to be cavalier about the country’s oil economy. Early this year, the government was woefully short of its disinvestment target. It needed emergency cash. So, it thought up this awful fix for its failure. The public sector oil exploration behemoth, ONGC, was coerced to pay nearly Rs 35,000 cr to buy the government’s shares in HPCL. Then, it virtually oppressed the rights of minority shareholders. Under the law, ONGC was required to make an open offer for 26 percent additional shares, providing an exit to HPCL’s shareholders who wanted out of this transaction. But the Modi government trotted out a 40-year-old law, the Nationalisation Act, to claim that the “public sector character” of HPCL had not changed, even though control had passed from the Ministry of Petroleum to ONGC. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) queued up and waived the open offer! Such a naked regulatory capture was the forerunner of yesterday’s unfortunate decision, the sheer arrogance of “big government” as it cancelled a free pricing reform that had been won through years of political turmoil.

PTI,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally in Ajmer in Rajasthan on Saturday, 6 October, marking the conclusion of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's state-wide yatra ahead of the Assembly elections in the state. Earlier, Modi was scheduled to visit Brahma temple in Pushkar town but he only attended the Ajmer rally. ""This will be a historic rally of the prime minister which will be participated by a large number of people,"" Onkar Singh Lakhawat, the chairman of Rajasthan Heritage Preservation and Promotion Authority, said. He said the party workers were ""fully geared up and filled with enthusiasm"" for the rally. The rally marks the completion of Raje's 'Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra' which she had begun from Rajsamand's Charbhujanath temple. Ajmer District Collector Arti Dogra said the prime minister will return to Jaipur after the programme. There is no schedule for Brahma temple visit in Pushkar, she asserted. The state Primary and Secondary Education minister Vasudev Devnani, who represents Ajmer North Assembly constituency, has been campaigning in the area and inviting people to attend the rally. Targeting Narendra Modi over his proposed rally in Rajasthan's Ajmer district, Congress' state chief Sachin Pilot, on Friday, said the prime minister remembers the city only at the time of elections. He also accused Raje of misleading the prime minister on the state of affairs in Rajasthan. Raje would have indeed misled the prime minister on development in Ajmer, he added. The prime minister addressed a public meeting at Kayad Vishram Sthali on the outskirts of Ajmer on the completion of Raje's Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra on Saturday. Pilot said Raje had begun her yatra in a bus but later she flew in a helicopter because of the resistance she faced from public during the yatra in different parts of the state. Ajmer district has eight Assembly constituencies and seven of them are represented by BJP MLAs while the Congress has one seat of Nasirabad. The Congress had won the Ajmer Lok Sabha seat by defeating BJP's Ramswaroop Lamba who is the son of former Ajmer MP Sanwar Lal Jat. The seat went to bypoll after the then sitting MP Sanwar Lal Jat died due to cardiac arrest last year. The Assembly elections in Rajasthan are due later this year.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"The killing of two National Conference (NC) activists, Nazir Ahmad Bhat and Mushtaq Ahmad Wani in broad daylight by unidentified gunmen in Karfali Mohalla, a congested neighbourhood in Srinagar interior on Friday, came two days ahead of the first phase of the urban local body elections in Jammu and Kashmir. According to police officials and eyewitnesses, a motorcycle carrying two young men slowed down beside a butcher’s shop. The pillion rider took out his AK-47 rifle and fired upon the two local NC workers. Both were declared dead upon arrival at the nearby SMHS Hospital. The mutton-seller Shakeel Ahmad Zangoo, with a gunshot in his arm, was declared stable. Nobody in the NC remembers when the party had laid down the last sacrifice in the summer capital, or elsewhere in the Valley. “4,000 of our workers and leaders have been shot dead in the last 29 years of militancy in Kashmir. But right now I don’t remember who was killed the last time. I’m sure nobody was killed in the last many years,” said Abdul Rehman Kawa, an old NC activist in Khanyar. “It appears to be linked to the municipal elections but we fail to understand why someone should target our workers as we have boycotted these elections,” he told  . NC’s area President Mohammad Yousuf Halwai was shot dead in his neighbourhood of Kalashpora, in downtown Srinagar on 21 August 1989. An MLA from Habbakadal and senior NC leader Shameema Firdaus said that one of the slain workers was also her personal assistant. “He told me over the phone at 10:36 AM that he would come to the office after the Friday prayers. At 11:25 AM someone informed me that both Nazir and Mushtaq had been shot dead.” Ms Firdaus claimed there were no takers for the police claims that the two NC workers had been killed by militants. In a conversation with  , she squarely blamed the BJP and Governor’s administration for allowing her men to be killed. “I can tell you with full responsibility that these two workers of our party were killed by the BJP with the help of renegades (counter-insurgents). Why should militants kill our men when we have boycotted these elections? They would have instead killed some of these renegades or BJP workers who are contesting the elections. We have been told that one of the BJP candidates in Tankipora area had threatened that his party would teach the NC supporters a lesson,” Ms Firdaus said. “These renegades and BJP and RSS workers brought in from Nagur, fear that the NC followers could vote for some candidates to defeat the BJP. They have imported some migrants and roped in renegades to ensure the victory of their candidates. We are watching it like mute spectators as none of us is participating in the current elections, either directly or by proxy. Still, they have apprehensions. These killings are clearly a signal to our workers to stay indoors,” Ms Firdaus said. Yet another NC leader referred to the BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav’s press conference in Jammu on 28 September. In response to questions, the senior BJP leader had alleged that NC and PDP workers were “sabotaging the municipal elections like terrorists”. He too had said that the people would teach NC and PDP workers a lesson for their decision to boycott the elections. An independent woman candidate in Ward 4 (Dalgate) in Srinagar was the first contestant who announced her withdrawal of nomination after the bloodshed in Karfali Mohalla. In fact, militants had restricted their attacks mainly to SPOs and police and security personnel in the last two years. Notwithstanding continual threats, few had apprehended political killings after NC’s and PDP’s boycott of the elections. With the fear of the gun looming large coupled with the NC’s and PDP’s boycott, nobody has filed nomination papers in a large number of wards across the Valley. Polling is being held in just around 200 wards as most of the BJP and Congress candidates have been declared ‘elected unopposed’. With 74 wards, Srinagar Municipal Corporation is going to polls in 3 wards on 8 October, 20 wards on 10 October, 26 wards on 13 October and 25 wards on 16 October. “It’s a totally farce. Nobody knows who are the candidates, who are the Returning Officers and who are the voters. They are keeping everything close to their chest with the excuse of security reasons,” said high school teacher Mushtaq Ahmad Wani. “We are placing 40,000 additional paramilitary troops on duty. We are sure that the violence, which left 13 persons dead on the day of polling for Lok Sabha elections in Central Kashmir on 9 April 2017, would not be repeated. We have made the best possible arrangements and left nothing to chance,” he said. Srinagar District Election Officer and Deputy Commissioner Dr Syed Abid Rashid refused to take questions even as Chief Electoral Officer Shaleen Kabra did not respond to phone calls. However, two senior police officers claimed that the NC MLA’s allegation against BJP was “unfounded and preposterous”. They claimed off-the-record that the NC activists had been killed by the militants associated with the Meraj Bangroo module of Hizbul Mujahideen. Well-placed sources in the Jammu and Kashmir Police revealed to   that they were clueless about the assassins. “Based on some inputs, we are working on three theories. But, as of now, we haven’t been able to lay our hands on a clue,” said a police officer. According to him, the first suspect was one Mohammad Tehseen Gojri alias Junaid alias Gabbar of Zaindar Mohalla Tankipora, who had disappeared after an encounter in his area in which three Hizbul Mujahideen militants escaped while killing a police constable two months ago. After he disappeared, he was believed to have joined a Hizbul Mujahideen module in Kulgam. Recently he had been deployed in Srinagar to strengthen the network of his outfit’s over-ground workers. The second suspects are LeT militant Meraj-ud-din Bangroo of Fatehkadal and his associate Fahad Mushtaq Waza of Khanyar. According to police sources, both of them were well-acquainted with Karfali Mohalla locality and they knew many of the mainstream political workers. They were also under pressure from LeT leadership to do “something big” in Srinagar. In April this year, suspected militants had shot dead a former activist of PDP and Congress, Ghulam Nabi Patel. As he was virtually disowned by both the parties, NC’s Vice President Omar Abdullah had tweeted that he should be counted as a worker of his party. In August, suspected militants kidnapped and shot dead BJP’s Pulwama leader Shabir Ahmad Bhat.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Mayank Mishra,"I missed the live telecast of the recent CVoter survey on ABP. Since credible surveys indicate a broad trend and I assumed it to be one, I was curious to check out the findings of the latest ‘Mood of the Nation’ report. After going through the highlights posted on the ABP website, I am still clueless as to how the magic figure of 276 for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was arrived at. What are the constituents of the United Progressive Alliance other than the Congress? Have JD (S), TDP, NCP, RJD, Left parties, TMC or DMK been considered as the allies of the Congress and hence part of the UPA? The survey had a sample size of 32,000 voters spread across all the 543 Lok Sabha seats. All that we are made to believe is that the NDA is expected to get 276 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. The survey also indicates marginal erosion in the NDA’s vote share and a perceptible dip in the prime minister’s popularity, from 69 percent in 2017 to 60 percent now. The survey findings however, have left many questions unanswered. Here are some: Why should we assume that we will have a trend reversal in 2019? Did the survey find something dramatic to suggest trend reversal? We have no clue from the published data. From what we know, it seems 2019 is going to be an action replay of 2014, despite erosion in the popularity of the incumbent. Someone needs to tell us how is that possible.

Suchindran BN,"Many years ago, in the aftermath of the creation of the famous basic structure doctrine, the legal scholar Upendra Baxi had written a much celebrated article titled, “The Constitutional Quicksands of Kesavananda Bharati and the 25th Amendment.” In it, he argued that the decision generates many paradoxes and that it was likely to be the Indian Constitution of the Future. However, he added that that the judgment was likely to create an illiterate bar because of its sheer length. He concluded by adding that the “illiteracy of the literate is more pernicious for development than that of the illiterate.” Today, with the majority judgment in the Aadhaar case, it seems his words have come to fruition. Let me point out four such instances as illustration. Firstly, the majority states that since the Constitution in Article 21A has made education between the ages of 6 to 14 years a fundamental right, such a right cannot be predicated on the obtaining of an Aadhaar Card and the admission of a child in school is neither a subsidy nor a service. It is a fundamental principle that rights do not vary in their effect and the hierarchy of rights is relevant only for judging their own validity. Hence, a rule or regulation has to be tested for its validity against the parent legislation; the legislation has to be tested against the Constitution; and a Constitutional amendment can be tested on the touchstone of the basic structure. Secondly, Justice Sikri strikes down the linking of bank accounts and mobile numbers with Aadhaar on the grounds that this does not satisfy the test of proportionality. The majority states that there can be no presumption of criminality and suggests that “those having modest balance and routine transactions can be safely ruled out.” Why is the same logic not applied to taxpayers? Can all taxpayers be presumed to be evaders? Thirdly, the Court accepts a mere ritualistic incantation of money laundering and black money does not satisfy the test of proportionality in the case of bank accounts, but accepts the same in the case of mandatory linking of Aadhaar to PAN. Fourthly, the majority by accepting that the Act could have been passed as a money bill has ensured that the Rajya Sabha is virtually rendered otiose. Governments will henceforth continue to bypass the Rajya Sabha at their convenience by getting the speaker to certify all inconvenient bills as money bills regardless of their content. Just as Parliament can make bad laws, Courts can also render bad judgments. But a judgment this bad, verbose and having no internal inconsistency, requires the institution to seriously introspect as to whether the Supreme Court is fulfilling the constitutional trust reposed in it by the founders as their continuing voice. This is a Dredd Scott moment in our constitutional history.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

S Aadeetya,"The State Bank of Mauritius said its Indian operations faced a cyberattack that could lead to a potential loss of $14 million (about Rs 100 crore) in the third such breach in the country this year. The attack happened on 2 October through fraudulent SWIFT payments and the bank is conducting an internal investigation, according to a statement on website of SBM Holdings, the lender’s parent. It’s a case of   for many, even in India, who were jolted by the recent Rs 11,300 crore banking scam involving diamantaire Nirav Modi and Punjab National Bank. You’d be wondering what does the Nirav Modi scam have to do with the recent attack on a bank. The common denominator is the global banking technology called ‘SWIFT.’ So, what is SWIFT and how is it used? We tell you everything there is to know. SWIFT – or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication – is a well-known electronic payment messaging service used by banks to transfer big-ticket transactions. This is the same banking technology which was  . SWIFT succeeded Teleprinter Exchange (Telex), which was used to transmit data during World War II. SWIFT was developed out of Brussels in 1973 by a group of seven banks. As technology evolved, Telex, which registered human errors, was replaced with SWIFT – it was seen as a secure alternative back then. Presently, SWIFT is trusted by over 11,000 financial institutions across 20 countries, including banks, brokerages, mutual fund firms, and those dealing in securities. A basic messaging system, SWIFT does not directly involve money, but its main process revolves around checking and verifying the transaction to be made. As experts put it, a successful SWIFT transaction involves three people: a maker, who initiates the transaction and reaches out to the checker, the checker, who passes the same to the verifier, and a verifier who authorises it. Once the verifier gives the go-ahead, the takes the transaction forward. Initially, these steps were thought to have minimised fraud, but recent incidents tell a different story. Like every banking transaction, SWIFT also functions around its ecosystem which comes in the form of SWIFT codes. This is a standard format of bank identifier codes (just like IFSC codes in India) that are approved by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO). Let’s take a practical example to make things clearer for you. If customer A goes to his bank to transfer money via SWIFT to customer B in another country, both banks will communicate via the system, cross-check for the finances in question, and the verifier gives the maker the go-ahead for the money to be sent. And if you think all this is free to use, then no, SWIFT provides its services for a fee. It basically makes money for setting up the network, servicing it, and charging for the equipment fee. It also earns a commission on every message that is sent. All this sounds good enough, right? What could possibly go wrong with this system? The biggest loophole in SWIFT is also the main reason why banking heists have taken place recently. Most banks believe that setting up their own SWIFT system keeps them secure from other banking networks. This self-dependent approach has worked against them, resulting in large-scale, untraced money movement. And it’s no surprise to see that Punjab National Bank is operating with its dedicated SWIFT interface available on-premises.  , who managed to control the movement of money with the SWIFT codes of the bank, making them hard to detect. Alarm bells were also raised by the   thrice since August 2016 on the risks arising from malicious use of the SWIFT system, something that obviously hasn’t been taken seriously by the banks. All in all, if the Bangladesh bank heist and the Nirav Modi scam are anything to go by, then the weakness in the SWIFT messaging system surely needs urgent attention.

Modi put on his Superman cape, and flew around the country ensuring that Rs 5 lakh were dispensed to each patient. Unfortunately, all 26 crore died, but Indian hospitals booked Rs 130 lakh crore ($ 2 trillion) of income.

So I went careening back in time, to Senator Bobby Kennedy’s iconic speech at the University of Kansas on 18 March 1968: Two thunderous applauses, for Modi/Kennedy, got mixed and amped up in my dream. And as happens so often, the noise in my sleepy head slowly dissolved into the real clapping sound coming from the TV screen as I woke up to the real world...

As is obvious from the arguments above, GDP is a fuzzy and imprecise measure of economic health. It is always fixated on ‘more’, not ‘better’. Let me end with the most crushing fact. Guess which was that five-year period during which America’s GDP leapt by 75 percent, the UK’s by 27 percent and Germany’s by over 21 percent?

Millions were killed, cities got bombed to rubble, ships were sunk, aircraft got crashed… but hey, enjoy, because the GDP of the warring nations swelled (with a bloody pride). : Don’t get me wrong.

Raghav Bahl,"Here’s a bedside reading recommendation for Prime Minister Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as they try to douse the IL&FS contagion:  . The first fax popped up on two machines in Lutyens Delhi on the evening of Saturday, 30 June 2001. One was sent to the chief economic advisor and the other to the finance secretary in the Vajpayee government, at their respective residences. The author was PS Subramanyam, the dubious chairman of Unit Trust of India (UTI), a public sector mutual fund set up by an Act of Parliament in 1963, controlling an astonishing 8 percent of market capitalisation. The fax was an SOS. UTI’s flagship scheme, US-64, had gone bust, its net asset value (NAV) severely eroded with negative reserves. Subramanyam’s recommendation was almost heretical, asking to “temporarily suspend the sale and purchase of US-64”. It was heretical because ordinary investors trusted US-64 like an indestructible currency note or bank fixed deposit. And this aura of commercial immortality had been created by the government itself, which kept US-64’s value and dividend payout fixed over decades, irrespective of volatile movements in the underlying equity/debt portfolios. For example, US-64 was holding 101 lakh shares of HFCL, which had dropped from Rs 2,553 to Rs 79; and huge stake in Sriven Multitech, whose price had crashed from Rs 450 to Rs 8.15. There were dozens of such sleazy transactions which had hollowed out US-64’s NAV completely. But small unit-holders were clueless about their penury, believing their investments were utterly safe in the hands of the sovereign. But on that fateful Saturday evening in 2001, what the sovereign held in his hand was a fax informing him that US-64 had become toilet paper. Yet strangely, the sovereign remained unperturbed, inactive over that weekend. It was a fatal, lazy oversight. On Monday morning, when US-64 investors learnt that their life’s savings had vanished, all hell broke loose. People, press, politicians, everybody cried “murder”. Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha was caught in the cross-fire. He wasn’t able to make up his mind whether to bail out US-64, or let it go belly up. The government kept on applying multiple band-aids on the gaping wound, until Sinha was transferred, almost one year later, from the finance to the external affairs ministry. UTI’s new, crisis-fighting chairman, M Damodaran, sought an immediate cash infusion of Rs 6,400 cr. Eventually, the total bailout package was pegged at Rs 14,561 cr. UTI was split into two entities: UTI-I included US-64 and other assured returns plans, and UTI-II comprised the NAV-based schemes. Calm returned. UTI was privatised. And some of the residual instruments left with the government in a special trust became red-hot stocks, giving handsome returns to the taxpayer. The State learnt a critical lesson that day: Financial fires, which threaten to destabilise the eco-system, should be put out quickly, surgically, without any doubt or demur. The post-mortem and punishment should happen  the fire is extinguished.

On 7 January 2009, its founder, Ramalinga Raju, faxed a shocking confession to the stock exchanges: ‘The Balance Sheet carries as of 30 September 2008 inflated (non-existent) cash and bank balances of over $1 billion. The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits over a period of last several years. I am now prepared to subject myself to the laws of the land and face the consequences thereof.’ Later that evening (India time), the New York stock exchange halted trading in Satyam. Broking firm CLSA called it ‘India’s Enron, an accounting fraud beyond imagination (and) an embarrassing and shocking episode in Indian corporate governance’. On the third day, India’s Company Law Board used its exigent powers to sack the entire board of Satyam Computer Services; but unlike in the past, the government did not nationalise the company or take direct charge. ‘The current board has failed to do what they are supposed to do. The credibility of India’s IT sector should not be allowed to suffer,’ saying this, the Manmohan Singh government appointed a couple of private sector professionals with unimpeachable integrity and global credibility. Unfortunately, the new board ran into an unexpected regulatory glitch here. India’s takeover rules were quite stiff: There were minimum equity pricing rules for new buyers. Shares could only be priced at a six-month average of previously quoted rates in large stock exchanges. But Satyam’s shares had fallen from a high of Rs 544 to Rs 12, so the average six-month price was working out to nearly five times the current scandal-hit market price of the company. It was simply impossible to sell Satyam under those rigid pricing guidelines. To everybody’s surprise, SEBI took less than five weeks to notify new, flexible rules to handle abnormal situations. On 13 April 2009, just  months after that fateful 7 January, Satyam Computer Services was sold to a joint venture of British Telecom and India’s Mahindra Group at Rs 58 per share. The Satyam stock more than doubled after it was re-christened Mahindra Satyam. I am again hearing ominous echoes from Raisina Hill mandarins: “IL&FS is a private entity; the government should not back-stop its defaults; let the bankruptcy system work itself out.” This is sheer folly. Right or wrong, IL&FS, like UTI in 2001, is seen to be a quasi-sovereign entity, owned and controlled by a clutch of public sector giants, including SBI and LIC. It has already defaulted several times in the last few weeks. It needs to repay Rs 34,000 cr from now until 31 March 2019. The most cash it can hope to raise by hastily selling equity and assets is around Rs 10,000 cr. Its operating cash flow is negative. So it shall continue to default unless emergency action is taken. Otherwise, the contagion will be devastating. Already the markets have wiped out Rs 10 lakh cr of investors’ wealth. The credit economy could gum up completely. Remember, beleaguered public sector banks are staring at a direct exposure of Rs 40,000 cr in term debt given to IL&FS. Provident and pension/insurance funds have an additional Rs 30,000 cr at risk. NBFCs, mutual funds and others could be forced to write off the balance Rs 20,000 cr. This is not the time to argue nuances around moral hazard. This is the time to hoist the fire hose, and spray calm into the markets. The government has got a plethora of options. It could create a superior debt/equity instrument for NIIF (National Infrastructure and Investment Fund), which could install a brand new management and oversee an orderly rescue, including asset sales over the next few months. Whichever option it chooses,  . A $ 3 trillion economy should not be held to ransom for a few billion dollars of liabilities. And once order is restored, the regulators can begin the arduous process of systemically reforming, and holding accountable, everybody who messed up in this saga, from the founders, directors, ratings agencies, the fragile apparatus of using short-term finance to fund long-gestation infrastructure projects, whatever! Ironically, Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to take lessons from the swift, decisive actions of two politicians he holds in disdain, former prime minister Manmohan Singh and former finance minister Jaswant Singh.

Saloni Dhanuka,"The Indian rupee halted its two-day gain as the measures announced by the government to curb the local unit’s relentless fall were seen inadequate. The domestic currency dropped more than a percent to 72.6725 a dollar early Monday, wiping out the gains it made in the previous two sessions. The local unit on Friday gained 34 paise against the greenback to close at a one-week high of 71.84 as  inflation added to optimism that policymakers will take steps to stem a rout in the rupee. Later that day, the government announced a   to prop up capital inflows and curb “non-essential” imports to contain the widening current account deficit, which widened to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in the April-June period, and check the rupee’s depreciation. But markets are not impressed with the government’s five-point plan, according to Ananth Narayan, professor at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research. Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, agreed. “The capital account measures announced are unlikely to result in any significant shift in fund flows in the immediate future,” he said. Yet, Narayan said India doesn’t have any reason to panic now. “We have plenty of reserves to manage core issues. We can buy the time to take steps.” Strong reiteration by the finance minister on maintaining the fiscal deficit and capital spending targets for the ongoing financial year will boost sentiment, he said. Brokerages Edelweiss and Nomura are bullish on the government’s steps. But, they said, given the build-up of expectations, the role of global factors in driving capital inflows and escalating global trade tensions, these capital measures are more medium term than immediate game changers. “Even as lack of any drastic measures may disappoint a section of markets, the government will likely remain more rupee vigilant henceforth,” Edelweiss said. Nomura’s two key takeaways from the announcement are: Narayan said more steps from the RBI are expected to address immediate sentiments and the current account deficit in the medium term. A possible RBI rate action, according to Edelweiss, may be on the cards in October amid increasing imported inflation pressures due to sharp moves in the rupee and Brent crude. The brokerage expects no further tightening beyond that as they said slowing growth and the recent currency weakness will moderate import growth in the second half of the ongoing financial year. “The risk is that dollar-rupee may trade through the 72-level and return to about 72.50 in the near term,” it said. “A stronger dollar and limited policy action could disappoint the market. There remain many negative risks to the rupee, but it is also clear that the government could step up actions if there is another round of significant depreciation.” Edelweiss for now maintains its dollar-rupee range at 69-74 for the rest of the ongoing financial year but said it will closely watch out for the policy space.

The Quint,"Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party will fight Assembly elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh on its own, BSP chief Mayawati announced on Wednesday, 3 October, thereby clearing long-held speculations of a possible alliance with the Congress. Calling Congress “arrogant”, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati launched an attack against Indian National Congress and accused the grand old party of back-stabbing her and her own party. She further accused Congress of attempting to “finish her party.” In a sharp statement and without mincing words, Mayawati on Wednesday told reporters that Congress is prancing forth in the race to elections under a misconception that they can defeat BJP, but are forgetting their own “corrupt” past. While the BSP chief maintained that Congress leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have honest intentions for alliance, she blamed party’s senior leader Digvijaya Singh for sabotaging the efforts for a tie-up. “Congress leaders like Digvijaya Singh do not wish for a Congress-BSP alliance. They are afraid of agencies like ED, CBI,” Mayawati said. She further called senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh an agent of the BJP. “Digvijaya Singh, who is also a BJP agent, is giving statements like Mayawati ji has a lot of pressure from Centre so she doesn’t want this alliance. This is baseless,” the BSP chief said. “I feel that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi's intentions for Congress-BSP alliance are honest. However, some Congress leaders are sabotaging this,” ANI reported, quoting Mayawati. Senior Congress Leader Digivijaya Singh reacted to the allegations of sabotaging the grand alliance and said that he has always favoured the alliance. Responding to Mayawati’s allegations against him on being an agent of BJP, Digvijaya said, “Please ask her, as far as I am concerned, I have been one of the bitterest critics of Modi ji, Amit Shah ji, BJP and RSS.” “Rahul Gandhi is our Congress chief, we follow his directions, “ Singh told ANI. Soon after Mayawati called off the alliance, Congress’ spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the party is still hopeful of things working out between BSP and Congress. “At times, out of emotions, sweet and bitter things are said. But at last, if Mayawati ji holds absolute trust in Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, then other creases can be ironed out,” Congress’ spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said reacting to Mayawati’s statement on issue of Congress-BSP alliance in upcoming assembly polls.

Meghnad Bose," Mohd Irshad Alam The man who raped and murdered 23-year-old Delhi University student Priyadarshini Mattoo in 1996 is reportedly being considered for an early release from jail by the Sentence Review Board of Delhi. Santosh Singh, the son of IPS officer and former joint commissioner of Delhi Police JP Singh, was convicted for the crime in October 2006. The Delhi High Court awarded him the death sentence, which was commuted to a life term by the Supreme Court in 2010. Here is what the rules of the Sentence Review Board state: And here’s the important fact: Santosh Singh has spent less than 16 years in jail, including remissions such as parole. Singh was acquitted by a trial court in December 1999 and convicted by the High Court in October 2006. The crime happened in January 1996. So, in the 22 and a half years since, if he was acquitted and out of jail for 7 years, he has clearly been in jail for less than 16 years. So to the Delhi home minister Satyendar Jain, who heads the Sentence Review Board, and to the other six board members,  . Speaking to  , activist Neelam Katara commented, “If something is so obvious as the rules and regulations not being met, then I think the authorities have something to answer for. They should not even be recommending Santosh Singh because it is a violation of the rules, and it is not difficult to count the number of years he has spent in jail. I hope the Sentence Review Board is aware of this and it raises the appropriate questions.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Jaya Jaitly,"‘Belief’ is inherently irrational and unscientific unless it is based on sound, proven and irrefutable evidence. Once evidence is available, that belief becomes a fact and cannot be contested. The controversy ends. At no point in the history of civilisation can we, as thinking human beings, decide we know all there is to know. Beliefs have changed over centuries across the world. If they hadn’t or weren’t allowed to change, we would continue to believe the earth is flat, plastic is good for us, and other such bunkum. If indeed our beliefs have changed and we have progressed, how can a portion of a community fight in court for the   that a deity has a ‘fundamental right’ ‘to practice his version of what celibacy should entail’? Or,   that women could shake the nature of the deity’s celibacy by their mere presence? Or even that all women between 10 and 50 years of age are menstruating regularly – after all, some girls hit puberty later or even earlier, and some women may have had hysterectomies and don’t menstruate? A simple solution in any sensibly thought out religious practice would have been to believe the ephemeral deity was celibate in his preferences and choices, and that he serves or represents those who choose to be the same. Many believers may wish to strike me dead, but I am entitled to rational argument in the absence of evidence of absolute proof. In fact, I have not seen practicing human celibates easily tempted, despite living within the presence of women. Those who are weak are prone to temptation, but surely deities aren’t supposed to be weak? As in rape, is the woman the one who is always to blame for a man’s weakness? If you haven’t read Anita Diamant’s 1997 book  please do so. It started a movement that helped women rid themselves of the stigma attached to menstruation. She writes a novel of biblical times as it would have probably been written if a woman had been its author. Diamant conjures a time, not based on biblical writings but on ancient common practices in Judaism, Christianity, and in many other cultures like Native Americans, Chinese and Africans, and indeed, as we can add, Indian, when spaces were set up for women to occupy, to care for each other, share stories of womanly strength, wisdom, childbirth, cleansing and value systems at menstruating or ‘moon time’. While the stigma of untouchability upon Dalits has been removed by law, why should people still object to applying the same logic when it applies to women in the case of temple entry? The caste system still claims legitimacy by sanctifying hierarchical divisions, but credible Hindu and non-Hindu voices have called for its abolition for decades, and our laws do not allow it. Recently its ideological chief Mohan Bhagwat proudly claimed that if people checked they would find that RSS members had the largest number of inter-caste marriages vis-à-vis other organisations. The reasoning is that society cannot discriminate between individuals based on the circumstances of their birth, including physical disability; menstruation for women is certainly not a physical disability for which a patriarchal religious order must ostracise, exclude, diminish or in any other way shut out women, using a deity as an excuse. For a country to truly call itself egalitarian and just – one not being possible without the other – a law cannot bow down to sectarian beliefs of multiple niche communities simply in the service of ‘diversity’. By the same reasoning, how can women have opportunities to get political empowerment if Nagaland disagrees on reservation for women because of tribal beliefs, or Muslims because of religious beliefs? If the parliament is open to women, temples should be too, irrespective of the physicality of the women. Let the temple doors be opened, and those women who choose not to offend the deity stay away, and those who think beyond that, enter. That would be allowing true freedom from patriarchy.

"Muhammad Fajar, Northwestern University","In Indonesia’s latest crackdown against terrorism, the government has targeted universities whose staff and students hold radical views. A recent report by Indonesia’s State Intelligence Agency (BIN) stated that radical groups have infiltrated   in Indonesia. In June, police anti-terror unit Detachment 88   Riau University in Pekanbaru, Riau. The police arrested three people and confiscated explosive materials. Earlier this month, six universities signed   with the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) to counter the spread of radicalism in Indonesian campuses. There are concerns that such crackdowns and agreements   academic life and undermine students’ freedom. Some people believe that campuses should be free from any political activities. I suggest otherwise. Universities are never neutral grounds that can be isolated from political processes. History has shown how universities in Indonesia and other countries have become battlegrounds for different groups competing for political influence.  on global student politics have shown that universities are institutions where different political views compete to win influence. This kind of competition also exists in Indonesian universities. In the lead up to the 1955 general election, student groups mirrored political competitions at the national level. A   documents how political parties such as Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) and Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI) established the   and the   to extend their influence on Indonesian campuses. Meanwhile, another political party, Masjumi, forged links with   (HMI). Its opposition partnered with   (CGMI). HMI and CGMI were locked in a battle to win influence after the failed coup attempt on September 30, 1965. In the end, HMI triumphed while CGMI and its patron, PKI, were banished from Indonesian politics. Politics also intervene in universities in Malaysia. Under a New Economic Policy in 1969, Malaysia’s Ministry of Education   every university to use Malay as the language of instruction within academic community. The policy drew two opposing reactions from student associations. On one side was the University of Malaya’s Malay Language Society, a student organisation exclusively for Malays. On another side was University of Malaya’s Student Union, a student organisation which accommodated non-Malay students’ interests. This clash represented how the racial policy at the state level shaped the politics of Malaysian student movements. In Indonesia,   links   religious movement in universities with the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), an Islamic party that has been able to gain considerable votes in post-authoritarian Indonesia. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, progressive student movements such as Malaysian Youth and and Students’ Democratic Movement (DEMA) and Malaysian Muslim Students’ Association (GAMIS) briefly   the political competition. The government responded by replacing critical lecturers and screening student representative candidates. These cases in Indonesia and Malaysia show how campuses are not quarantined from politics. Politicians often target students to win their support. In addition to political students movements, it is important to note that the production of new knowledge in universities is a result of political processes. The New Order regime under the dictatorship of Suharto   influence and shape social science research. The regime actively censored researchers that were critical of the government. These researchers were banned from investigating sensitive topics. These topics include the wealth of former president Suharto and human rights violations in Aceh, East Timor (now Timor Leste) and Irian Jaya (now Papua). The New Order administration created a watch list for scientists to   their criticism. The US shared a similar experience with Indonesia. Between 1960 and 1966, the country’s Defence Ministry   its social research budget to US$160 million from US$10 million. The huge budget was allocated to support  , a project to help win the Cold War. Scholars from reputable universities like Princeton University, Columbia University and Stanford University were recruited for the project. But university academics don’t always comply with the powers that aim to dominate knowledge production. They are also able to utilise their own influence and space to resist state domination. One example of a mutiny by academics occurred in Australia. Based on interviews with 30 academics in 10 Australian universities, a   documents protests by academics against the introduction of private practices in public sector institutions. The protests came in the form of academics refusing to do the requested work. Instead, they overloaded feedback and evaluation systems, and refused to hold virtual classes and do administrative works. Dynamics within universities are always political, and different interests compete for influence. This competition, in turn, has shaped intellectual activities through their attempts to bring professors and students into political debates. Freedom never comes without power struggle. By understanding that universities are political battlefields, those who despise radicalism should mobilise a coalition to fight radicalism. This would be the more strategic move to defend academic freedom. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Nishtha Gautam,"Perumal Raphael vows never to eat boeuf bourgignon again as he twists and turns in his bed. Or maybe it is the cheap wine from earlier this evening. He has a sleepless night ahead, thanks to the buzz in his head, accompanied by a rumbling stomach. “What the hell do you want,” he yells at the impatient knocker while dragging himself to the door. It is just 6 in the morning and FK Hollande is at his door, craning his neck above a thousand marigold garlands. “Vote for me, Raphael,” Hollande says and grabs the sleepy man’s waist as camera flashes blind the latter. FK Hollande is the Mahagathbandhan candidate from Puducherry and sources say that he’s set to win. He’s also Raphael’s maternal uncle. ‘The Mahagathbandhan of the opposition parties has found an invincible candidate’, the headlines scream. The prime minister is in trouble now that we have Hollande in our team, claims R Rajkumar, in the lede. Raphael didn’t care much for politics earlier but Hollande’s appearance on the election scene has changed it once and for all. His Tamil father, an air force officer, married an Auroville-born Frenchwoman and Raphael is their only child. The French influence is too strong to be ignored. Sipping beers by the promenade later in the day, Raphael explains to his girlfriend how Hollande has aced the art of stealing headlines. “It’s important to be in the news, Nirmala. Even your friend Arun knows it so well. Out of mind, out of sight. Tick-tock! Don’t be upset about Hollande’s flamboyance.” “But surely he’s a liar,” retorts Nirmala. Raphael tut-tuts at her naiveté. They are deeply in love but the relationship has been strained for some time. “Trump card, yeah,” she loosens up a bit. It’s easy for her to put 2+2 together now. After their date, Raphael trawls the internet to know everything about his uncle’s debut in Indian politics. The more he reads, the higher his interest soars. Now he knows that the Mahagathbandhan has been under a bit of duress ever since the prima donna of subaltern politics called out the arrogance of the self-styled leading party of the coalition. When Hollande was handpicked by R Rajkumar, the entire Opposition supported him, including the prima donna. Notwithstanding, even one day is a long time in Indian politics. After her exodus, Hollande’s role grew much bigger. A   political commentator educates him on how it’s all about illusions anyway – sustaining or destroying them. The illusion of corruption-free governance has been shattered and Rajkumar’s foot-soldiers have been going at it chanting “ ”. Raphael also figures out that the ruling party hasn’t been silent. The details of Hollande’s midnight rendezvous with his mistress are all over social media. Grainy pictures of him on a motorcycle outside the apartment of his mistress, another man’s wife, are shared with copy-paste templates of abuse. What else can be expected out of an adulterous man, seems to be the sentiment. In this country, nothing works better than invoking  , muses Raphael. It’s easy to convince the voters that the un- folk are also criminal-minded. Hollande’s mistress therefore, is not only an adulteress but also a wheeler-dealer. They are both given to sin. How can they be trusted? Rajkumar and his team however, have decided to empower Hollande by bringing national pride into the debate. How dare anyone make fun of our  laziness! Raphael comes across column after column suggesting how a  company is being wrongly penalised for inefficiency. One columnist has surreptitiously recanted his scathing criticism of this company.  Even the Big Brother doesn’t want anything to do with his under-performing  whose power, communication, infrastructure are all awaiting the good days. A generous dose of feel-good news goes a long way. Battle cries need to play on this emotion. If in 2014 it was ‘Achhe Din’, why can’t it be “Humaara HAL Achha Hai” this time? Raphael thumps his fist on his table in excitement and cheers for his uncle. He wakes up with a start and looks around. It isn’t dawn yet, and his stomach is still rumbling.

Alok Prasanna Kumar,"When he was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of India on 23 April 2012, it was fore-ordained that Justice Ranjan Gogoi would be in line to take over as Chief Justice of India in October 2018 by dint of the seniority convention. No one, least of all Gogoi himself, could have possibly imagined that he would be taking over as the CJI in the circumstances that the court finds itself in. In his expected tenure of a year and two months, Gogoi has the unenviable task of trying to restore an institution whose credibility and reputation lie in tatters, given the events of the last two years. His path to the Supreme Court involved a detour as the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, before he was elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court of India. While dark rumours persisted about a possible super-session in light of the press conference in January this year, the government eventually followed convention and procedure in confirming his appointment to the post of CJI. Sitting in his courtroom one gets the sense of a judge in absolute control of the proceedings before him. He speaks in measured tones and rarely allows the counsel to get carried away. He does not tolerate any senior counsel trying to throw their weight around in his courtroom and is more than an intellectual match to most of them. With his jurisprudence as well, he is measured and careful. If Gogoi has so far not left us a bigger track record in more important cases, it can only be attributed to the machinations of CJI Dipak Misra, who has refused to include senior judges on constitutional benches hearing important matters. Given his superbly well-reasoned judgement in   (concerning the appointment of non-Brahmin   in Tamil Nadu) one would have loved to read his take on religion and constitutional rights in the Sabarimala case. It ill behooves a Supreme Court judge to take criticism (even from another judge) in such a personal manner, even if it was intended to be taken personally. It sounds unfair, but there are certain obligations that come with an office of such importance and dignity, and Gogoi didn’t respond to it well enough. Since 2013, Gogoi has been on the bench overseeing this and as I’ve written  , his concern for speed and efficiency in preparing the NRC has come at the cost of millions of people at risk of losing their rights and livelihoods – and raising ethnic tensions across the region. There’s also the uncomfortable fact that he is from Assam himself and leaves himself open to the accusation that his approach to the NRC case may be less than entirely impartial. One can only hope that he’s cognizant of the risks of the process. Gogoi is taking over an institution in turmoil. Not just the Supreme Court, but the judiciary as a whole. The last two Chief Justices of India have not exactly covered themselves in glory. Controversies have erupted over appointments, corruption, misconduct, impeachment, internal procedure and government interference. Their handling of all of this has been marked by the consistency with which they have failed to defend the institution of the judiciary. Much of this may be a battle of perception and norms, but it is having a real impact on the ground.   across the country as the court’s own data shows. The judiciary continues to have   at the higher levels, reflecting in some of the problematic judgments we have seen concerning Dalits and women. The press conference in January gained immense credibility not only because of his presence (given that he was in line to be Chief Justice next) but also because he uttered the most significant words of the press conference – his “yes” to a question indicating that it was the Judge Loya case which prompted the press conference. It is also no coincidence perhaps that Gogoi was on the collegium when they started to make resolutions public. This happened immediately after the controversy over the   and can’t help but think the two are linked. One further reason to believe that it was Gogoi who was behind this idea of making resolutions public is his judgment in  . Here, his judgment set the stage for a total overhaul of the process by which senior advocates are designated by the High Courts and the Supreme Court in India. If this judgment is any indication of his thinking, one would draw the conclusion that this is someone who’s fully cognizant of the deeper institutional issues facing the judiciary that can’t be handled by putting Karnan in jail. Gogoi is perhaps fully aware of the burden of the task that lies before him. He couldn’t have missed a statement by Fali Nariman advising people to wait for Gogoi to take over to really fix things with the Supreme Court. While CJIs are inevitably snowed under a mountain of cases and administrative work, Gogoi will have to manage that and fix the processes that have broken down. He will have to take his fellow judges into confidence and undertake the kind of massive systemic reforms from within to allow the judiciary to withstand the increasing pressure it faces. He will have to put transparency above all if he needs to restore the court. Perhaps the best he can do is to start the process of reform and trust his successors to take it forward. Even if he simply rebuilds the trust between judges of the Supreme Court to get them functioning as one unit, he will have made an immeasurable contribution to the institution. For the sake of India’s constitutional government, one hopes he will succeed.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Mayank Mishra,"Other than very unfortunate reports of mob lynching at regular intervals from all across the country, we are faced with regular doses of news like a weak rupee, an unusual spike in crude prices resulting in costlier domestic fuel, sulking allies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and by-election losses for the ruling coalition. Are we witnessing an action replay of 2013 all over again in 2018, at least in terms of the often buried but powerful headlines? Take the rupee’s free fall in recent months, for instance. Having already fallen nearly 8 percent in the last six months alone, breaching the psychologically important 69 rupees to a dollar mark, there seems to be no respite in sight. If we dig deep, the picture looks quite grim. The best we have had is a figure of $310 billion achieved in 2014-15. The twin data speak eloquently about the competitiveness (rather, the lack of it) of our manufacturing sector despite the much-hyped ‘Make in India’. The only saving grace for hitherto manageable trade deficit (excess of imports over exports) was massive drop in crude oil prices which together with gold constitute bulk of our imports. Now that crude oil prices have started inching up, our trade deficit has begun to go haywire, putting pressure on the value of rupee vis-à-vis dollar. While the slide in rupee in 2013 was seen as calamitous and symptomatic of a weakening economy, with a ‘weak’ prime minister at the helm, the current spell of rupee depreciation has been conspicuous with its absence in media debate. The Indian currency incidentally has been the worst performer among all its Asian peers this year and experts warn us that the fall is going to accentuate even further. There is no denying that rupee depreciation contributes to economic woes as it pushes our import bill, resulting in costlier fuel, gold and all other imported items. It is bad for general price trend too as the current spell of an 8 percent rupee depreciation is estimated to add at least 1.2 percent to headline inflation. What is going to weigh in on rupee further is the spurt in global crude prices. The crude has been hovering in the range of $80 a barrel and the price of petrol closer to Rs 75 a litre in Delhi. Does this not remind us of what we saw and screamed about in 2013? While the official line is that prices now are market-linked (let us remember that the decision to put additional excise duty on domestic fuel had nothing to do with the market though) and there is very little that can be done, we have seen days and weeks of temporary price controls, suggesting a policy that is inconsistent and generally uncharitable to the people. Mainstream media meanwhile continues with its all-is-well shrill as if nothing has happened. From all-weather allies like the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal to Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), the ruling BJP has had an uneasy relationship with all its partners of late. While most of the apparent unease could be a bargaining ploy on the part of allies to get an upper hand in distribution of seats, there is no denying that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance does not give the impression of a steady ship. DMK top brass would grudgingly complain that their leaders were made scapegoats. The UPA then looked like a divided house about to explode. The Congress itself looked unsure of itself with some top leaders even opting out of the electoral battle ahead. Is there a message here? There is no denying that the BJP has had a dream run since its spectacular show in the 2014 Lok Sabha, winning state after state. However, the party seems to have been faced with some serious anti-incumbency now, if recent electoral reverses are any indication. The losses in Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha constituencies in Rajasthan, Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairan in Uttar Pradesh and Bhandara-Gondia in Maharashtra must have punctured the invincibility of the saffron party. Sounds familiar again? The Congress was decimated in almost all elections held in 2013. The defeat was staggering in states where the grand old party was in direct contest with the BJP, giving an indication of what was to come in 2014. Do the recent poll losses of the BJP send out the same signal? Can we afford to ignore the underlying message behind the recurrence of the same set of headlines after five years?

Aishwarya S Iyer,"By the year 2019, three villages in Varanasi will meet the ‘model’, or ‘adarsh’ village status; Or at least that is what was promised when they were adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In November 2014, a month after the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana was launched, the first village, Jayapur in Varanasi district, was adopted. This was followed by the Nagepur village in the same district in March 2016. The third village, Kakrahia, was adopted in mid-July 2017. So how are these villages in the PM’s home constituency faring?   visited Jayapur and Nagepur villages to check if the goals outlined had tick marks against them. The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana vows holistic development of the villages, with a focus on physical and institutional infrastructure. The scheme also calls for integrated development across the sectors of agriculture, health, education, sanitation, environment and livelihood. Of the three villages, Jayapur was scheduled to attain the ‘model village’ tag by 2016. The entry to the village is marked by a bus stop. There are posters of PM Modi everywhere. Locals here are used to the presence of media personnel, who have been regular visitors to Jayapur ever since the PM adopted the village. As per official sources, Jayapur has a population of 4,200, who live in approximately 650 houses in the area. Some of these houses are home to up to three or four families.   asked residents about the standards of basic amenities like health, education and sanitation to understand whether life at the village had really changed. ""After Modi adopted the village, two banks were constructed. Now, we don't need to travel to adjacent villages for bank work. We have a post office here, too. The village gets electricity through solar panels and Jal Nigam (water board) pipes are currently being laid,"" Shiv Prakash, a 48-year-old farmer, told  . The 550-odd government-constructed toilets in the village are used by all – save for a few washrooms that were under repair. Prakash, who has two children, says he sends his 10-year-old daughter to an English-medium private school closer to the city. “A school for girls was set up here almost three years ago, but it isn’t functional. Women have been using the classrooms to run the charkha there instead,” he says. At the school, women sit in a grid-like fashion in big empty rooms, constantly moving their muscles to the motion of the charkha. We spoke to a young woman, Ankita Singh, who said she manages the making of the khadi cloth at the school-turned-workshop. ""Since the school is not yet functional, the village head gave the space to the women. Around 80 women work here for six hours a day and make around Rs 2,000 a month,"" she says. The aanganwadi, which is in the same compound as the school, has broken windows and a dilapidated toilet. The sight of broken glass in four places of a one-room aanganwadi that is full of children is a worrying sight. The only relief is the presence of Rekha Devi, who has been teaching in the village for nine years now. She watches the children to make sure they don’t injure themselves on the glass. ""We really needed an aanganwadi here. Thankfully, this was built. Otherwise we used to teach either at people’s homes, and sometimes outside their homes too,"" she says. Rekha alleges that the windows and tiles of the aanganwadi are damaged by fellow villagers. This has been happening for three years now, she says. “The damage is done time and again by people of higher castes as we are primarily a Scheduled Caste village. They are jealous that we have all these benefits,” she alleges. Rekha says they've complained to the authorities, who, in turn, ask the villagers to take care of the situation. ""We come here to teach,” she says, adding, “they can't expect us to sleep here at night, right?"" When asked about the drainage system in the village, she says: ""The Jal Nigam has begun work here, but the village doesn't have a drainage system. Once there is water here, where will all of it drain out to? Something needs to be done quickly"". asked Jayapur village head, Narayan Patel, about the condition of the school. Patel said the girls’ school was not fit for use because they were waiting for five more rooms to be constructed. When asked why construction had been delayed, he said: ""The company that made the five rooms has been given an estimate. When five more rooms are constructed, the school will start within the year."" When asked about the other problems like Jayapur’s lack of a working hospital, or a co-ed school for those above Class 5, he said: ""Needs are innumerable. A lot has been done, but despite this, there is a lot of work still left to do”. Patel is a BJP worker; his home is plastered with photos of BJP leaders, including one of him posing with the PM. While Jayapur has fallen short of meeting all the goals outlined in the scheme by its 2016 deadline, it cannot be denied that some progress has been made. Our next stop was Nagepur village, 15 kilometers away. The village, adopted in March 2016, is home to about 4,200 people who belong to the Scheduled Caste, officials claim. A spotless community space, marked with a bronze statue of BR Ambedkar, greets visitors to Nagepur. When asked, locals confirmed that they were making use of the toilets that have been built by the government in the village. A bus stop and an aanganwadi were constructed in the village, locals said, adding that a Jal Nigam tank was currently under construction. When asked about the facilities in the area, locals spoke about the lack of a school for students beyond Class 5. ""Kids are dropping out after Class 5 as the village does not have a school,"" says Rashmi Verma, a 32-year-old who teaches at the only school in Nagepur. Another resident lamented the lack of employment opportunities. Poonam, who asks us to guess her age, is visibly upset as she talks about her unemployment woes. “Four women came here in 2016 and 2017 and took down our name, village, Aadhaar number and mobile number. They said they will give us work to make pickles and papads or give us sewing machines,” she says. “So what will women do to survive here until then? Women ask for work, but we aren’t given any,” says the mother of four. ""Men are forced to go to the city to make Rs 250-300 a day as there is no work here,"" she says. ""I often travel to the city for work. There are no other options,"" confirms 33-year-old Vinod Kumar. While the homes in the village are electrified, previous efforts to introduce solar energy to the residents have failed to bear fruit. In the green fields across the road from the settlements, the residents point to a bit of land where a solar energy firm had set up a plant in 2016. ""The solar company came here and stayed for about 10 months. The person on whose land the solar plant was built on, had asked to be paid in exchange for the use of his land. But the company refused to pay. After 10 months, they packed up and left. The land is worth Rs 15 lakh."" The lack of a hospital in the village is another major concern. ""They said the hospital will be constructed, but the work has not even begun. Everyone goes to a government hospital five kilometers away from here,"" a resident says. When asked about the residents’ complaints, Panchayat head, Paras Natraj, told : ""We need a school for children to study beyond Class 5. We need a hospital in Nagepur and we need drainage systems. “I have written letters to the PMO, but haven’t gotten a response yet. They came and saw some land for the hospital six months ago, but there hasn't been a follow-up since,” he alleges. When asked about employment opportunities for women, he said there was a room close to the village bank where work like sewing and cooking is taught. ""Everyone in the village knows about it. My job is done, whether or not they use these facilities. I can't help it,"" the head says. After visiting both villages,   headed to Varanasi city to speak to BJP Varanasi district in-charge, Hansraj Vishwakarma, who BJP workers say is the official in charge of the implementation of the central government scheme in the area. On being asked about the aanganwadi in Jayapur being repeatedly attacked, he responded: ""Every village and society has its issues. We tried to speak to the people about not damaging the aanganwadi. But it was broken down due to politics during the elections"". When asked about the three-year delay in fixing the damaged aanganwadi, he said: ""Budget is the problem. We asked for funds through letters to various people"". When asked for copies of these letters, Vishwakarma said he did not have any. When asked about the delay in the construction of a school for girls, he said he was not aware of the issue and that he would conduct an inquiry and get back to us. This article will be updated with his response.  also asked Vishwakarma about the problems of unemployment that plague Nagepur residents like Poonam. ""We will fix the issues that the locals have. We will write letters to administration and ensure benefits reach them,"" he said. The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana promises, among other things, access to basic amenities and opportunity to the residents of these villages. Despite visible progress in terms of infrastructural development, in the form of banks, post offices, water pipes and aanganwadis, both Nagepur and Jayapur have many more boxes to tick before they can rightfully claim the 'adarsh village’ tags – more so for Jayapur, which is well past its 2016 deadline.

Kota Neelima,"Security forces are holding back thousands of farmers who have gathered on the outskirts of Delhi from entering the city. Barricades have been set up to block their way and roads have turned into war zones. Tear-gas has been used against the farmers and many of them have been hurt in the  charge. It is not clear how the hurt farmers are being provided medical assistance. The government in Delhi is apprehensive that, if allowed, the farmers will walk on the well-paved roads of Delhi under the beautiful Fall foliage. The elderly among them might even decide to rest under the trees and mess up the aesthetics of the Capital. They might even bring the dirt of their agricultural fields to the fashionable spots of Delhi, and who knows; some of them might even end up in Khan Market. Such crisis must be checked with alacrity and efficiency. The demand for C2 + FL (comprehensive cost, includes rent and interest on owned land plus imputed value of family labour) in place of A2 + FL (actual cost plus imputed value of family labour) is therefore a valid demand. Demand for loan waivers and free power may not find resonance with neo-liberals who will turn a blind eye to the fact that between industry and services, they account for 86 percent of non-performing assets (NPAs), as per the  But the spectre of farmers at South Block might be disturbing to those in power. PM Modi did not even once mention in his speech on 2 October 2018 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan to commemorate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who was a farmer himself. The farmers are demanding employment for a family member of any farmer who commits suicide.  This has certainly reached epidemic proportions. Instead of methodologically reducing farm suicide numbers by a statistical sleight of hand, why does the state not evolve a coherent policy to end farm suicides? Then there is the danger that the farmers might block traffic and throw daily life into a tizzy. The government wants people to get to their offices so that the economy functions. Businesses of the state and industry lose if roads are blocked, and that’s why the assembly line of men and women must reach the ‘production’ facilities. This is non-negotiable; after all, political funding has a personal relationship with deep pockets. Slogans and acronyms on farmer-friendly policies can only be a fig leaf for a government that is, in fact, passionately and avowedly corporate-friendly. In 2017-18, insurance companies have collected Rs 24,450 crores in premiums, while only Rs 402 crore rupees have been paid to farmers in claims. The government in Delhi is also scared that the farmers, if allowed to reach Rajghat, may end up actually resembling the Mahatma’s non-violent soldiers fighting homegrown neo-colonials. Farmers demand that a pension system for farmers over 60 years of age, like there is for ministers, MLAs, MPs, soldiers, bureaucrats, post-retirement. Why shouldn’t a farmer get the same benefit?  All demands of the farmers will have to be personally addressed by the government. The ministers may have to make time in their busy daily schedule, probably shift the meeting with the international delegation to the evening, and meet the farmers instead. Then the government will promise to ‘look into the farmers’ demands,’ serve tepid tea in indifferent   cups and end the meeting. Nothing will come out of the meeting, especially when the farmers ask for relief from GST.  Even the farmers would know that nothing will improve their lives, and nothing will stop farmer suicides. The farmers, especially, would know that the government in Delhi does not care. It never did. And that is the fear of the government in Delhi. That, perhaps, it has filled the villages with darkness because of its obsession with making the cities shine. That, maybe, now that darkness has surrounded Delhi and wants to cover Rajpath as well. ‘Please vote’, the politicians insist; that is the best way to show the anger, the desire for change. ‘Please vote’, they say, because that is the best way to be heard in Delhi. The fact is; ‘please vote,’ because the government in Delhi doesn’t want to see, hear or know the masses that are being stopped on its outskirts. Do not come into the beautiful cities, don’t walk into the gleaming bazaars, don’t disrupt PM speeches. Just vote from a distance. And wait.

A private importer, MRM Ramaiah Enterprises had imported around 55,000 tones of river sand from Malaysia through Thoothukudi port for sale in the domestic market last October. The state government, however, through its public works department had seized the trucks carrying the sand to the buyers and ordered that the imported sand should not be sold in the state. The aggrieved private company however approached the Supreme court seeking its intervention against the Tamil Nadu state policy of not to sell imported river sand though it had adhered to all the requirements of the Central government’s policy on importing river sand. In the case, the Tamil Nadu government expressed its willingness to buy the sand and sell it through its PWD.

According to GCC officials, corporation maintains around 16 parks in the city and maintenance works are being taken up at regular intervals. In order to increase green cover in all parks, they permit certain volunteers and NGOs based on their track record for taking up works.

Poonam Agarwal," Purnendu Pritam and Abhishek Sharma Sumitra Mahajan, Lok Sabha speaker and a Member of Parliament, adopted the Potlod village in Madhya Pradesh in 2016 under the  (SAGY). Two years have passed since, but not an iota of work is visible on the ground, claimed residents of Potlod. On 1 October,  published the first story of the series on  adopted village, Rawal, in UP. The main objective of SAGY was to have MPs cater to the needs of their adopted village and work towards its holistic development. Some of the goals that the MPs were expected to achieve were: The government started the SAGY project with the goal to develop three Adarsh Grams by March 2019, of which one was to be achieved by 2016.  spoke to the residents of the village belonging to different strata of the community. This village had been a strong hold of the BJP. Since 2016, Mahajan has spent around Rs 8 crore on the ‘ ’ of the village. But has any change really happened on the ground? Now let’s take a look at the work done by the Lok Sabha speaker, one by one. The roads connecting Potlod with other villages were repaired five years ago. Over the years, the number of potholes on the route have increased, but there are no sign of new constructions. Sumitra Mahajan promised to build a higher secondary for girls under SAGY. But for now, it exists only on paper. The village girls who want to study after Class 8 are compelled to travel 4 km daily to the Chandravati village. The nearest hospital from Potlod is 58 km away in Indore. The villagers complain that even the delivery of a child, they at times have to travel to Indore, and the bad roads only add on to their plight. The villagers themselves light the streets outside their houses, as there are no street lights. The villagers also complained about the lack of drainage facility and hygiene. The village head said lack of funds is the reason for poor drainage system. Potlod is not exactly a poor village, but on most counts, the people are left to fend for themselves.

Ashok K Mehta,"Sri Lanka’s strategic string of pearls are its ports – Kanakesanthurai (KKS), Point Pedro, Trincomalee, Hambantota, Galle and Colombo, and major airfields at Palaly, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Mattala and Katunayake. The emerald island straddles the crucial ocean channels 6 and 10, while sea traffic plies along channels 4 and 6 below Galle and (the new) Hambantota ports. Sri Lanka, more than Japan, is like an aircraft carrier guarding all seven east-west gateways to the Indian Ocean that criss-cross sea lanes of communication, 10 to 12 nautical miles from the country’s southern coast. Nearly 100,000 ships transit annually, two thirds of the world’s oil shipments, one third of bulk cargo and half the world’s container traffic pass through these waters, constituting USD 5.3 tn worth of trade passing through Malacca Straits into the South China Sea. As India has no deep water (23 m) ports for bulk cargo containers, it is building a deep water port at Vizhinjam in Kerala. Prime Minister Modi laid its foundation in 2016 saying it would be ready in 1,000 days, though there is not even a breakwater due to land acquisition hurdles. Once the port is operational by 2025 it will be a threat to the Colombo port. The latter’s expansion by China has created a fourth pier which has been offered to India, three others being with Sri Lanka, Singapore and China. A Colombo Port city, the new financial hub, is being built – no guesses, by the Chinese – and will be ready by 2025 with a 75-year lease and ownership of part of the land. The controversial Hambantota port which was first offered to India, is proving to be a bad commercial investment, but its strategic value is promising. The Sri Lanka Port Authority operates it and the Sri Lankan Navy is re-locating its Southern Command from Galle to Hambantota to reassure India. No Chinese warships have visited Hambantota. Nearby is another potential China-built strategic pearl – the Rajapaksa Mattala International Airport, which too has proved commercially unviable. It has been offered to India involving investment of USD 400 mn with a 40 years lease. India is undecided. Although Trinco’s strategic value has diminished after the ethnic war, India has been operating 19 of 100 World War II oil tanks since 2002 by Indian Oil Corporation with a 35 yeas lease in arrangement with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Colombo wants New Delhi to develop Trincomalee Port and an elaborate MoU was signed in 2017. Similarly, India is considering refurbishing Palaly and Kanakaesanthurai, both in Jaffna peninsula. India has informed Sri Lanka that Chinese submarines in Sri Lankan waters will be deemed an inimical act though Rajapaksa last week in an interview to an Indian TV channel. Jockeying for strategic space in which Rajapaksa favoured China, is leveling out with the present government making balancing offers to an ambivalent India constrained by shallow pockets, though it has committed USD 3 bn in aid and grants to Colombo. Recently, after India undertook housing projects in the South which are gratis unlike China’s, Beijing sought to move into the North but was checkmated. It covets Mannar, the strategic ace on the north-western coast. India still generates strong emotions of colonial vintage: not so, Chinese who are seen as distant do-gooder friends. But India is a proximate neighbour and relative. Sri Lanka is universally cited as a basket case of BRI – for opacity and debt entrapment. Colombo’s Galle Face Green is full of Chinese labourers. Chinese companies allegedly paid bribes to the Rajapaksas. The Sirisena government suspended and reviewed all Rajapaksa-era projects, but doing a Mahathir was not feasible. Colombo’s debt to Beijing and ADB (China) is anywhere between USD 15 to 20 bn with 6 to 12 percent interest rates. Some sweeteners like a grant of USD 300 mn and loans at very low interest rates have been given to remove the odium of the debt trap. Still debt burden has converted into equity – Hambantota and Colombo Port City. Given the falling Sri Lankan rupee and a flailing economy, Lanka will likely borrow more from China to pay back China – starting 2020. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"In the wake of the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala, which lifted the ban on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Ayyappa shrine, Hindu organisations are holding marches across Kerala in protest. The protestors want to protect the ‘Ayyappa Dharma’ and say they will continue fighting against systems and laws that plan on destroying the ‘treasured age-old customs and traditions at Sabarimala’. The Pinarayi Vijayan administration has told that accommodating women at the Ayyappa temple is ""impractical"". ""Worshippers have to wait for eight to ten hours in long queues for  , and women devotees should also be prepared for the same. We cannot do anything. Only those who are prepared to wait for hours in long queues should come here,"" said Minister for Co- Operation, Tourism and Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran, as quoted by  . He claimed that if there are separate queues, then that could result in women being separated from their families, which was not advisable. Meanwhile, the government is planning to bring in facilities like separate washrooms, CCTV cameras, female police personnel and bathing areas. They are likely to introduce digital booking facilities to keep a control on the crowd as well. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan chaired a high-power meeting discussing the various arrangements to be made. A few activists, rallying under the banner of Sabarimala Protection Council, blocked traffic in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, resulting in mild tension. In Kochi, the protesters gathered on the National Highway at Vyttila, reported  One of the women in the protests strongly condemned the order. ""We don't want to go the temple. The verdict is quite saddening for us, it has even put us under mental stress. We won't be able to see women entering the temple. We will seek support of all Hindus to resist the entry of women,” says Suresh Kumari to  . Hundreds of Ayyappa devotees, including women, held the  , organised by the Pandalam Palace. The Pandalam Royal family, who still have the rights over the rituals conducted in Sabarimala, said they would soon file a review petition against the verdict. An agitating woman from Kottayam even poured petrol over herself demanding that Hindus be protected. She was taken away by police, and was reportedly sent to a hospital, reported  Meanwhile, scores of people, led by Rahul Easwar's Ayyappa Dharma Sena and other Hindu groups, walked from the Hanuman temple in East Fort to the Rakthasakshi Mandapam. Easwar asked the gathering to take a pledge. ""We respect the Supreme Court. We will not stop the feminists and other women who come to the temple with our hands. We will not push them. But prepare yourselves for they can only go to inside temple by stomping our hearts. We should be there on 17th evening when the temple opens,"" reported  Meanwhile, the Kerala BJP has asked the government to bring an ordinance to restore the pre-judgment situation, similar to what Tamil Nadu did with ‘Jallikattu,’ reported  . The BJP and the Sangh Parivar affiliates have called for a meeting on 8 October to discuss and file a review petition in the Supreme Court. The BJP is blaming the state government for making arrangements in accordance with the judgment, and not paying attention to devotees’ bodies, temple   (supreme priest) and others. Ravi R Unnithan, Convenor of the Kerala State Committee of the Aam Aadmi Democratic Movement (AADM), told  “It’s not just the Malayalis who go to Sabarimala. It is important to note that many of the men who are Ayyappa believers from other states, once they wear the chain which marks the beginning of the vow, they do not even eat the food cooked by the women of the house. That shows how pure the practice is and how the verdict of the SC destroys the purity of the temple.’ Since the minute the judgment was passed, several have taken to social media giving reasons why this judgment is a disrespect to Hindu traditions and how ‘false ideas’ of equality for all was breaking down their age-old system of beliefs.

Ishan Garg,"It’s not like before Aryabhatta invented the zero, people didn’t count. They did and the West even had a number system in place, ie, the Roman numerical system. Zero didn’t give the world numbers, it gave the world so much more – the power to take the numbers to infinity and discover infinite infinities between numbers with the decimal system. What’s this got to do with Gandhi? Gandhi is the Aryabhatta of political methodology. Before Gandhi organised a civil disobedience movement in South Africa to protest against the ill-treatment of Indians, the world did not know of such a thing as  .  People disobeyed the law and in massive numbers since the French revolution, but it was Gandhi who created disobedience as a tool of political methodology to influence the government’s decision-making process. Democracy today relies heavily on the power of civil disobedience, a popular form of which is a ‘protest’. Gandhi did not just lead a movement to drive the British out of India; he created something so powerful and efficient that the modern democracies see protests against the democratically-elected governments as an inalienable right of their citizens. Gandhi created a political tool, very much like Aryabhatta created a mathematical tool. Gandhi did not invent democracy just the same way as Aryabhatta did not invent counting. But what both of these men did was create a tool in their respective disciplines that have changed the way we do things on a day-to-day basis. The notion of protest today is so widespread in democratic societies that we forget the man who made it mainstream in the first place.  Every citizen who protests today is inadvertently paying homage to the Mahatma just as anyone dealing with numbers is paying a tribute to Aryabhatta.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Annie Zaidi,"Growing up, I never heard anything about who belonged in the kitchen. My mother didn't stay any longer in the kitchen than was necessary. She put food on the table though. And books in the library. When she visited home a couple of times a year, she remembered to take small gifts of cash for her own mother. My grandmother was in the kitchen a lot. She never went to school but even from her, I never heard anything about women and kitchens. She was hoping I'd become a doctor or a bureaucrat. Future in-laws were never mentioned. In all my years of schooling and college, none of my teachers – male or female – ever hinted that girls belonged in the kitchen. At this fine moment in our nation's history, the former chief minister of Gujarat and current governor of Madhya Pradesh has been telling female students that they must cook tasty  to appease their mothers-in-law. In fact, they might as well start right away by helping out in the hostel's mess kitchen. While she was at it, she also advised girls not to cut their hair short, else the in-laws wouldn't let them into the house. These threats about in-laws' acceptance are   to a young girl. She knows she is not welcome, beyond a point, in her parents' home. She may be needed by a husband – for sex, for labour, for the care of the elderly – but the home is not one she owns. It is a place she occupies cautiously, taking nothing for granted. One wrong move, and she will be accused of breaking up a family. One wrong haircut, and she might be turned out. It is the ogre of patriarchy crushing the few heads that are starting to hold themselves higher. Instead of reminding young girls of the hard battles fought over the last two centuries by our fore-mothers – for the right to own and inherit property, to not be the legal property of fathers and husbands, to be educated, to earn and enter professions formerly barred to them – Ms Patel seems to be saying:  I'm not sure what Anandiben makes of the government's official campaign to “save” daughters (that is, not kill them before they are born nor immediately after) and to educate them. Perhaps it is with her blessings that the Barkatullah University, one of the bigger ones in the state of Madhya Pradesh, announced a three month   (ideal daughter-in-law) course, allegedly to “prevent families from falling apart”. Nowhere is she mistress of her destiny. Instead, she must first imagine a future in which her life is organised around husband and in-laws. Then the university offers her training so she may bend to a politics intent on stealing her freedom and the fruits of her labour. A   is many things but above all, she is a worker in a job that she cannot easily quit. The most common advice given to a bride is to work hard and pose no challenge to members of her marital home. An ideal daughter-in-law fits in like sugar in a cup of milk. There is no such thing as an ideal   (son-in-law), of course. No university teaches sons to adapt to in-laws; they don't have to live with them or meet the expectations of strangers. They visit like honoured guests. The men who do live with their wives' parents are often derided, either because they are not earning enough to move into an independent home or because they must do what women do: adjust, fit in, not call the shots. In every family, there is potential for friction, for stress and emotional harm. But who carries the greater burden of trying to avoid friction by ridding oneself of one's own personality and constantly pleasing others? Indian women, especially married women, commit suicide in great numbers. That's worth thinking about, as our leaders ask young women to please in-laws and future husbands. What are they asking? Older women, especially who have themselves drunk deep at the fount of power, ought to have the grace   to tell younger women to toe the line. Instead, they ought to be telling them to chase dreams, to grow into the fullest possible version of themselves, to not shy away from conflict, to not bend backwards for anyone, lest they break.

Shashi Tharoor,"The most striking feature of the first 75 years of Indian independence has, in fact, been an absence – that of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. In his immortal   speech to the nation on the midnight of 15 August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru had spoken of the Mahatma as “embodying the old spirit of India” whose message would be remembered by “succeeding generations.” Just five months later, on 30 January 1948, the torch of this spirit was tragically snuffed out by a Hindu fanatic, in the capital of the new state – he had done more for than anyone else – to establish. Today, in the post-truth era, it is fair to ask how much that old spirit survives. Gandhi  was profoundly influenced by the principles of  and and gave both a profound meaning when he applied them to the nationalist cause. But though publicity posters for the Oscar-winning 1982 film  proclaimed that “Gandhi's triumph changed the world forever”, I am far from convinced it did. At the same time, he was a philosopher who was constantly seeking to live out his own ideas, whether they applied to individual self-improvement or social change: his autobiography was typically subtitled  . No dictionary imbues “truth” with the depth of meaning Gandhi gave it. His truth emerged from his convictions: it meant not only what was accurate, but what was just and therefore, right. Truth could not be obtained by untruthful or unjust means, which included inflicting violence upon one's opponent. To describe his method, Gandhi coined the expression  literally “holding on to truth” or, as he variously described it, truth-force, love-force or soul-force. He disliked the English term ‘passive resistance’ because   required activism,   passivity. If you believed in truth and cared enough to obtain it, Gandhi felt, you could not afford to be passive: you had to be prepared actively to suffer. So non-violence, like many later concepts labelled with a negation, from non-cooperation to non-alignment, meant much more than the denial of an opposite; it did not merely imply the absence of violence. Non-violence was the way to vindicate the truth not by the infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on one's self. It was essential to willingly accept punishment in order to demonstrate the strength of one's convictions. Where sporadic terrorism and moderate constitutionalism had both proved ineffective, Gandhi took the issue of freedom to the masses as one of simple right and wrong, and gave them a technique to which the British had no response. By abstaining from violence, Gandhi wrested the moral advantage. By breaking the law non-violently, he exposed the injustice of law. By accepting the punishments imposed on him, he confronted his captors with their own brutalization. By voluntarily imposing suffering upon himself in his hunger-strikes, he demonstrated the lengths to which he was prepared to go in defence of what he considered to be right. In the end, he made the perpetuation of British rule an impossibility. The US civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr attended a lecture on Gandhi, bought half a dozen books on him and adopted   as both precept and method. King, more than anyone else, used non-violence most effectively outside India in breaking down segregation in the southern states of the USA. “Hate begets hate. Violence begets violence,” King memorably declared, going on to say, “We must meet the forces of hate with soul force.” King later avowed that “the Gandhian method of non-violent resistance... became the guiding light of our movement. Christ furnished the spirit and motivation and Gandhi furnished the method.” In 2011, the then US President Barack Obama told India’s parliament that were it not for Gandhi, he would not be standing there as President. India's independence marked the dawn of the era of decolonisation, but many nations still came to freedom only after bloody and violent struggles. Other peoples have fallen under the boots of invading armies, been dispossessed of their lands or forced to flee in terror from their homes. Non-violence has offered no solution to them. It could only work against opponents vulnerable to a loss of moral authority – governments responsive to domestic and international public opinion, capable of being shamed into conceding defeat. In Gandhi's own day, non-violence could have done nothing for the Jews of Hitler's Germany, who disappeared tragically into gas-chambers far from the flashbulbs of the press. The power of Gandhian non-violence rests in being able to say, “to show you that you are wrong, I punish myself.” But that has little effect on those who are not interested in whether they are wrong and are already seeking to punish you for your disagreements with them. For them, your willingness to undergo punishment is the most convenient means of victory. No wonder Nelson Mandela, who told me that Gandhi had “always” been “a great source of inspiration”, explicitly disavowed non-violence as ineffective in his struggle against apartheid. The sad truth today is that the staying-power of organised violence is almost always greater than that of non-violence. Some twenty million lives have been lost in wars and insurrections since Gandhi’s passing. In a dismaying number of countries including his own, governments spend more for military purposes than for education and health care combined. As the Mumbai terror attacks of 26/11 demonstrated, India faces the threat of cross-border terrorism to which the Mahatma’s only answer – a fast in protest – would have left its perpetrators unmoved. Gandhism without moral authority is like Marxism without a proletariat. Yet, few who have tried his methods worldwide have his personal integrity or moral stature. The coercive  , the hypocritical “relay fast”, the theatrical misuse of  , only show how far the world has fallen from Gandhi’s ideas of truth. None of this dilutes Gandhi's greatness, or the extraordinary resonance of his life and his message. While the world was disintegrating into fascism, violence and war, the Mahatma taught the virtues of truth, non-violence and peace. He destroyed the credibility of colonialism by opposing brute force. And he set and attained personal standards of conviction and courage which few will ever match. He was that rare kind of leader who was not confined by the inadequacies of his followers. He formulated its unique content and determined its application in a specific historical context. The originality of his thought and the example of his life inspires people around the world today, but Gandhi's triumph did not “change the world forever”. In the post-truth world we live in, I wonder if the Mahatma would feel he had triumphed at all.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Where Morarji was more experienced and less favoured due to his obstinacy, Lal Bahadur Shastri was honest and the more loved among the two.

Shastri faced some of the greatest challenges as soon as he became the Prime Minister. One of these was food scarcity. When several states was grappling with drought, Shastri undertook steps that perhaps only he could have done. In an interview, his son Anil Shastri says: The country took his suggestion seriously. He also wanted people to grow crops and vegetables on unused lands. Consequently, he could be seen ploughing the Pradhan Mantri Awas lawn. Soon after Sino-Indian war in 1962, another war awaited Shastri’s strong leadership. Pakistan repeatedly opened fronts in the Rann of Kutch and Kashmir. At this time of political upheaval, Shastri took a decision that made history. He asked General AK Choudhary to open the Punjab front. This decision changed the game altogether and India was on the verge of annexing Lahore. At this point, Shastri’s famous slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ became the voice of the nation. Shastri is known for his simplicity. Even after becoming Prime Minister, he didn’t have the money to buy a car for himself. He took a loan to buy a car. The country remembers this able leader on his 52nd death Anniversary. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Under flak for allegedly ""defending"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale deal, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday, 1 October, said that he would ""never"" do that and claimed the country was ""looted"" in the multi-billion dollar fighter jet purchase from France. Pawar's comment comes days after his   that people had no doubt about Modi's intentions in the purchase of the fighter jets, was inferred as defence of the prime minister. The NCP leader, who is being seen as a key figure in galvanising opposition parties as a common force against the ruling BJP, rejected the reports that he had ever supported the escalation of the price of the fighter jets. Addressing a party meeting in Beed in the Marathwada region earlier in the day, Pawar said, ""Some people have criticised me saying I supported him (Modi). I have not supported him. I did not (support Modi) and will never (do that)"". He said, ""They (the government) bought the aircraft. I am saying this clearly that the government should explain to Parliament why the cost of the aircraft rose from Rs 650 crore (per plane) to Rs 1,600 crore"". In a tweet in Marathi, Pawar said, ""(Former Prime Minister) Rajiv Gandhi had faced an enquiry when allegations were raised in the Bofors matter (in the 80s), but nothing came out of that probe. Those who had demanded a probe at that time are now in power, but they are keeping mum on Rafale deal. The country is looted in this deal."" ""The Centre should explain to Parliament the escalation of the price of Rafale aircraft from Rs 650 crore to Rs 1,600 crore. This episode need to be probed and the documents of the deal should be placed before all parties,"" he said in another tweet. Pawar's previous statement that people had no doubt about Modi's intentions in the Rafale deal had came at a time the Congress has launched a pointed attack on the prime minister over the issue, and is trying to forge an alliance with the NCP for future polls. Pawar's recent comment which was inferred as defence of Modi was welcomed by the BJP and party president Amit Shah had thanked Pawar for the same. However, the NCP had claimed that Pawar was quoted out of context by the media. Pawar, who served as agriculture minister under the erstwhile Manmohan Singh government, also hit out at the Central and Maharashtra governments over agrarian issues. Hailing the previous UPA government's decision to write off farm loans worth Rs 71,000 crore, he alleged that the Maharashtra government is insensitive to the plight of farmers. Addressing the rally, he questioned the government over the quota demands being raised by various communities like Dhangar, Muslims and Maratha. Pawar alleged that the government was misusing its power to harass workers and leaders of other parties. ""The prime minister speaks his 'Mann ki Baat' but not 'Jan ki Baat'. He never listens to the grievances of farmers, minorities and youths,"" the NCP chief said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Visiting the apartment of a male friend from her own college. The girl and the boy are both students of a nursing college in Meerut. However, while the girl is Hindu, the boy is Muslim. This did not go down well with either the mob – members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad– or the UP police. In a video that went viral in September, four police personnel seated in their official van are seen hurling abuses at the girl. A police woman also goes on to thrash her and yank her scarf off her face, while a police man asks: "" "" (You like the Muslim man better?).

When the girl's parents went to pick her up from the police station, they found VHP members gathered there. The girl and the boy had reportedly been harassed by the members at the police station, as well. The VHP members, as told by the girl's mother, also tried to shame her daughter before her. While the police were finally willing to let the girl go, her parents said they wanted them to file a complaint against the boy. But the girl's parents say they refused to comply.

In Rajkot, PM Modi inaugurated a newly-built Mahatma Gandhi Museum at Alfred High School, where Mahatma Gandhi did his matriculation in 1887. The school was renamed Mohandas Gandhi High School after independence. It was closed in 2017 after a decision was taken to convert it into a museum.

The village is yet to be open-defecation free. Hema Malini, who also endorses Kent RO, installed an RO water plant in the village. But ironically, the villagers say they rely on water tankers for clean water more than the RO plant. A junior school exists in the village, but it has no power supply because of which the students complain of lack of focus while studying. A new primary school was built, but that is non-functional either. According to the village head, it is so because the whitewash of the school has been pending for months.

Anna MM Vetticad,"The Catholic Church traces its origins to that day, approximately 2,000 years ago, when Jesus appointed a leader among his Apostles with these words cited in the Bible, “Simon, you are Peter (meaning, rock), and upon this rock I shall build my Church.” You would expect a two-millennia-old organisation to have its act together in the area of legal procedures and communication. Yet, since news broke in end-June of a nun’s rape allegation against the (now arrested) Bishop of Jalandhar, Franco Mulakkal, the Catholic Church in India has appeared to be a floundering, leaderless mess, falling short of basic humanity in its response to a woman’s grave grievance. From conversations I have had with dozens of Catholics across India throughout September, it is clear that a sizeable number are furious at the Church’s conduct in this imbroglio. Even some higher-ups are disillusioned with the top leadership’s inertia. The complainant in this case, let us call her Sister X, belongs to the Missionaries of Jesus, a fledgling congregation of Catholic nuns headquartered in Jalandhar. Sister X and her supporters say her appeals to Church authorities went unheeded, compelling her to approach the police in Kerala where the alleged rapes occurred. Considering his position of power, Mulakkal should have graciously stepped down to facilitate the police probe. Instead, he stayed on for two-and-a-half months, before temporarily handing over administrative responsibilities in Jalandhar to a junior on 13 September. Church sources call this a “pre-emptive move” by him because action from the Vatican at long last seemed inevitable since Cardinal Oswald Gracias of Mumbai – who is on the Pope’s Council of nine cardinals advising him on Church reform –   and had publicly stated he would try to alert Pope Francis to the issue. On 20 September, the Vatican temporarily replaced Mulakkal with another Bishop in Jalandhar, purportedly at his own request. This decision, however, came after Missionaries of Jesus was widely condemned for maligning Sister X in statements and circulating her photograph to the media, ignoring the law against disclosing a sexual abuse victim’s identity. The lasting image from this episode may forever remain the unprecedented sight of five nuns – Sister X’s allies within Missionaries of Jesus – sitting on dharna in Kochi from September 8-21 demanding justice for her. Church authorities may yet have ignored them, if they had not been joined by ordinary Catholics and priests, some of whom believe the Church tried to cover up the case while others were outraged by its silence when the congregation defamed Sister X. For years, India’s Catholic liberals have vented their disgruntlement – in private, at conferences within the community and occasionally in public – regarding misogyny in the Church, the position taken on homosexuality and abortion by bumbling Church spokespersons on TV, financial corruption and more. What the nuns on   have, in a sense, done is rip the doors off those conference rooms and jolt a patriarchal, bureaucracy-ridden Church, thus becoming a rallying point for Catholic reformists. The nuns are backed by the   comprising Catholic laity and priests across denominations. The   has been crucial, since it has marginally influenced even Catholic conservatives, as I have gathered from off-the-record conversations. When murmurs of doubt emanate from conformists and when rebels emerge within the power structure, religious organisations tend to take note. On September 11, a representative of Delhi’s Catholic Church  that Mulakkal should resign while the police investigation is on. The die was cast with Cardinal Gracias’ statement cited earlier in this column. “The Church in India has failed its people in this episode,” a senior priest told me on condition of anonymity while explaining how the ancient monolith works. If Sister X has felt traumatised by the nearly three months it took to arrest Mulakkal, she is likely to have been exhausted by the lumbering leviathan that is the Catholic Church if she had kept her case within the organisation. The senior priest elaborated on Sister X’s options in the Church mechanism. For a complaint about the Jalandhar Bishop, the first stop is the Archbishop of Delhi who has authority over a region that includes the Jalandhar diocese. The CCBI can hold an inquiry and forward its findings to the Vatican where the Church’s global head office is situated. The Vatican alone may remove a Bishop. Like Indian courts, the Church is notoriously tardy. What Sister X faced though is not slowness but inaction. Her family has   she had approached Delhi’s Archbishop Anil Couto with her problem to no avail. Couto has not denied this. Besides, Father Stanley Kozhichira, spokesperson of the Delhi Church, told me that on a trip to Kerala this May (that’s before the police complaint was filed), Couto met Sister X. She is unlikely to have kept her troubles from him anyway since he would be personally acquainted with her, having been Jalandhar’s Bishop before Mulakkal. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) is an assembly of bishops across all rites groups. CBCI is not authorised to take up a complaint against a Bishop. Asked why it did not at least act as a pressure group to force Mulakkal to resign, the senior priest pointed to inter-rites rivalry in India which is so extreme that such a united move is wishful thinking. The churn among India’s Catholics over Mulakkal’s case is yet another wake-up call for a Church already grappling with complaints of paedophilia against priests in multiple countries. The good news is that last week Pope Francis – widely considered a liberal – called a February 2019 meeting of representatives of Catholic bishops worldwide to discuss the abuse of minors and adults. Religious leaders everywhere tend to expect sheep-like acquiescence from their flock. This expectation in the Catholic Church is at odds though with its reputed commitment to the education of the masses including its own people (the reason why the number of Catholic-run schools and colleges in India is “second only to government-run institutions” as journalist Farah Baria noted in 2015 in  ). While a trickle of Catholics   too have spoken up when approached by news media, many more might have joined in but for the worry that the community’s protests could be appropriated by the ruling right-wing BJP, just as Muslim women’s battle against instant triple talaq has been used by BJP to promulgate an Ordinance that activists say is designed to victimise Muslim men. Wounds are yet to heal from the murder of Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines and his little sons, pan-India attacks on Christians during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s PM-ship and in Karnataka under BJP rule, the 2008 Kandhamal riots and the targeting of Christians after BJP formed the Central government in 2014. Besides, anti-Muslim violence since 2014 has got all minorities on edge. It is remarkable that none of these issues deterred Sister X’s supporters. Catholic liberals must now raise the decibels over other issues too, taking a cue from Sister Anupama – one of the nuns on dharna – when she told   Jimmy James, “We’re not staging this protest to shame the Church or for any reason other than to ensure that no nun, no woman for that matter, ever finds herself in this position in future.” Diplomacy is not a mark of affection in such situations, and the Church would be wise to realise that its strongest critics may well be its greatest well-wishers.

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"Paradoxical though this may sound, but the Supreme Court verdict turning down the plea to send the 1994 Ismail Faruqui case to a larger Constitutional Bench, may eventually eliminate extraneous matters which have complicated what is quintessentially a civil dispute and force future hearings to the core issue. This is the same case where the apex court made the sweeping assertion that “a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of the religion of Islam”. From a fundamental question of ownership or title of the disputed structure (or the land), all sorts of faith related questions have been added to complicate an already byzantine legal maze. The return to the title suit now pending for almost seven decades, which will be heard from October 29 by a newly constituted bench, marks new hope for arriving at a judgement aimed at settling the original dispute. These hearings will, however, be overshadowed by the opinion of significant sections of people, almost in its entirety among the religious minorities but also within the majority, that the sanctity of a religious place has been ridden roughshod over in the (recently endorsed as ""secular"" by Mohan Bhagwat) republic. It will be recalled that the judicial viewpoint prevailed over a minority opinion not once, but twice—in 1994 and now. That the minority view on both occasions was voiced by judges belonging to religious minorities, although coincidental and not necessarily reflective of majoritarian bias, will not bolster confidence in the judiciary. The first majority judgement, pronounced by three of the five judge bench, concluded that in Islam a place of worship is not central or of vital import as namaz “can be offered anywhere, even in open”, without as much as either detailed examination of Islamic scriptures or the query being central to the case. The dissenting verdict of Justice S Abdul Nazeer now provides several reasons why the issue of essentiality and centrality of a mosque in Islam must be heard by a larger bench. If the Supreme Court, too, follows the path which the Allahabad High Court chose when it pronounced the populist judgement on September 30, 2010, faith of people will be severely eroded in the judiciary. Justice Nazeer wanted the 1994 judgment to be examined by a larger seven member bench purely on the strength of several other cases of lesser import being referred to bigger benches in past. He also sought the reference to examine whether “Article 25, only protect(s) belief and practices of particular significance of a faith or all practices regarded by the faith as essential?” Despite the legal imbroglio on Ayodhya being narrated ad nauseam, there is need to recall that the 2010 verdict of the High Court was pronounced twenty one years after four civil cases—three by Hindu parties and one by the Sunni Central Wakf Board—were clubbed together and were transferred to the Allahabad High Court. At the outset of its verdict, the judges recounted what they had been up against: ""Here is a small piece of land (1500 square yards) where angels fear to tread. It is full of innumerable land mines. We are required to clear it. Some very sane elements advised us not to attempt that. We do not propose to rush in like fools lest we are blown. However we have to take risk."" Such metaphorical text apart, what has been contentious and would be challenged now in the apex court, is that in the majority opinion of the High Court judges (thankfully one Hindu and one Muslim judge) the verdict was reached on the basis of faith and not treated as a title suit. It dismissed Sunni Waqf Board's suit for possession of the mosque for being time-barred and because its demolition changed the nature of the disputed site. Significantly, the two judges also declared the site as the birth place of Lord Ram on the basis of faith. Consequently, it argued that because Muslims and Hindus had been in possession of the disputed site—Muslims inside the precincts and the Hindus just outside touching the boundary wall—till December 1949, both communities were owners of the land. The land was split into three portions because there were two Hindu claimants besides the Sunni Waqf Board. The judgement was welcomed by most Hindu groups including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its affiliates, most significantly the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the vanguard of the Ram temple agitation. They were happy that the court decided the matter on the basis of faith and recognised the site as Lord Ram's Janmasthan. Politically, it would be beneficial for the Bharatiya Janata Party if an early verdict is delivered and, at least, the High Court judgement is upheld, if not a new one is pronounced in favour of Hindus. The BJP would rather that all legal hurdles impeding temple-construction be cleared by early next year. A definite calendar can, then, be announced during the forthcoming kumbh mela, arguably the biggest global congregation of Hindus. Such a verdict carries the risk of social unrest but conflict on communal lines would only benefit the BJP. In his paper ‘Law in a Pluralist Society’, Justice MN Venkatachaliah contended that law in pluralistic societies must not progressively assimilate minorities in a majoritarian milieu but must “devise political, social and legal means of preventing them from falling apart and so destroying the plural society of which they are members.” In 1994, the Supreme Court was confident that “Ayodhya is a storm that will pass. The dignity and honour of the Supreme Court cannot be compromised because of it.” To ensure this, it will have to derive strength from a Jonathan Swift quotation used in this order: “We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.” In January this year, when several judges addressed an unprecedented press conference, it was widely perceived to be in response to the demitting CJI, Dipak Misra succumbing to the official pressure. Much has since happened in the corridors of the apex court and spotlight has been cast on the apex court like never before. There is ample reason to believe that Justice Gogoi would be cautious while allocating cases to judges and ensure that credibility of the Supreme Court is not undermined. Unlike previous occasions, the judiciary under a new CJI will have to discover sufficient religiosity to make Indians love each other. It unfortunately is a tall order and makes the apex court's task even more daunting.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"Refuting news reports that a senior officer of the Ministry of Defence had allegedly objected to the Rafale negotiations before the deal was signed, Nirmala Sitharaman, the Minister of Defence, said that the officer who objected was a signatory to the final note on the agreement which was sent to the Cabinet. Speaking to  , she  , “There may be disagreements among those negotiating the deal at the time of discussions and those disagreements may even be noted on an official piece of paper. But in the end, the collective decision had the officer's signature on it.” The officer had been part of the Contract Negotiations Committee (CNC) for the Rafale aircraft deal, raising questions about its benchmark price a month before the deal was signed,  reported on Thursday, 27 September. The officer, according to  , had also put his objections on record before the the deal for 36 Rafale aircrafts was signed between the then-defence minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart in New Delhi. His objections to the deal had delayed the Cabinet note approving the deal. But the deal was reportedly signed after his objections were “overruled” by another senior MoD official, Director General (Acquisition),   reported. The note is now a part of the Rafale deal file which is currently with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) who is studying the deal, the report of which is going to be submitted by the winter session of Parliament in December, sources told  According to  , the proposal for 126 Rafale jets was part of the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) tender issued in 2007. The Indian Air Force had conducted trials of fighter aircraft of six firms under the tender. Negotiations then began with Dassault after its bid, along with Eurofighter’s, the second aircraft which had qualified in the IAF trials. According to  , the note had pointed out that the makers of Eurofighter — the second qualifier among the tenders — had offered a 20 percent discount on its bid price to the Indian government in July 2014. The note argued that a similar 20 percent cut should be applied for rates in the case of 36 Rafale aircraft. The note, according to   sources, was considered by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Parrikar in August 2016. That DAC meeting had been scheduled to approve the 36 Rafale deal and initiate the process of preparing a note for the approval of the Cabinet, but was postponed after the objections. The objections in the note were overruled by the DG (Acquisition) who said that the benchmark price had to be compared with the price offered for 18 Rafale aircraft, as part of the MMRCA proposal,   reported. The JS & AM (Air) then went on a month’s leave, after which the note was initiated by another official holding charge of JS & AM (Air) and was, subsequently, approved by the Cabinet in the third week of September 2016.

The Quint,"The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously struck down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code that makes adultery a punishable offence for men. In four separate but concurring judgments, the five-judge bench of the Supreme Court said the 158-year-old law was unconstitutional and fell foul of Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty) and Article 14 (Right to equality). The Supreme Court on Thursday paved the way for resumption of the hearing of the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute case and refused to constitute a larger bench to revisit the 1994 verdict that said a “mosque is not essential to the practice of Islam”. The judgment cuts short the timeline to a possible closure of what is now just a straightforward land dispute case — the complex and broader issue of a mosque not being integral to Islam will now not be reconsidered. Responding to a report in   on Thursday, that a Ministry of Defence official had placed on record his objections on the deal to procure 36 Rafale aircraft, official sources said that it “betrays ignorance of the collegiate process involving due deliberations and diligence at various levels, through which all major Government decisions are typically taken.” Sources added: “While ensuring utmost integrity and transparency, the process allows for opinions to be freely expressed, recorded, discussed and, if necessary, modified”. Three militants and a soldier were Thursday killed in two gunfights in Anantnag and Budgam districts of Jammu and Kashmir, the Army said.

The Congress President was speaking at a public rally in Chitrakoot in Madhya Pradesh, where he also hit out at the Modi government over the unemployment issue.

The 182-metre 'Statue of Unity', being built at Sadhu Bet in Narmada district, is slated to be inaugurated by Modi on Patel's birth anniversary on 31 October. Hitting back, Shah attacked Gandhi for his offensive against the Prime Minister, saying it was a ""shame"" that at a time when India is united in paying tributes to the country's first Home Minister by building a grand 'statue of unity', he is ""spreading canards"" to discredit the project. It is a very disgraceful statement and the BJP strongly condemns it, he said. The BJP chief also tweeted ,""Dear Rahul Gandhi, your family humiliated Sardar Patel, unsuccessfully tried to erase his legacy from the people's hearts and minds. Your lies on the 'statue of unity' is another display of your visceral hatred towards Sardar Patel.""

Adeeba Mujahid,"A Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has unanimously struck down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 198 of Criminal Procedure Code,1973 in Joseph Shine Vs Union of India as violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. Section 497 of IPC, an archaic provision of Victorian morality, criminalised the act of adultery/sexual relationship with another man’s wife, “without his consent or connivance”, and was based on the premise that the wife is a chattel or property of her husband and the victim of the crime of adultery. In its operation, Section 497 empowered the husband of a woman having a relationship outside her marriage with a penal provision to ensure fidelity and to get the “outsider” punished for being intimate with his wife without his permission, while he himself could commit infidelity with other, unmarried women. Under Section 198 sub clause (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, only the husband of the woman was deemed to be aggrieved by the offence of adultery, and therefore only he could file a complaint in this regard, excluding even the wife of the adulterer from the category of “aggrieved person”. The Hon’ble Court has found the provision to be manifestly arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, a ground for challenging a legislative act, recently expounded by Justice RF Nariman in the ‘Triple Talaq case’ (Shayara Bano Vs Union of India & Ors); and also contrary to the concept of “equality” and “essential dignity”, which has repeatedly been held by the apex court to lie at the core of Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court also found as impermissible the state entering the real private realm of marriage, distinguishing it from other offences relating to marriage like the demand of dowry, domestic violence, denial of maintenance etc. The judgment penned by the Hon’ble CJI, Justice Dipak Misra, takes a practical view of the matter, that a punishment is unlikely to establish commitment. It therefore makes sense that adultery is one of the grounds for seeking divorce by both husband and wife under our legal system. The Hon’ble CJI has called criminalising adultery a “retrograde step”, without referring to, but in the spirit of the judgment in Navtej Singh Johar Vs Union of India. The Court has, however, decriminalised the act of adultery with a caveat that there cannot be any kind of social license to destroy a matrimonial home and the act remains a cause of action for bringing in civil action and a ground for divorce. The concurring judgment of Justice RF Nariman traces the religious history of the sin of adultery and the law on adultery in India, along with the position of law in other jurisdictions on the subject. Thus, the argument of the state that the object behind the provision is protecting the sanctity of marriage, did not find favour with the court. Justice Nariman has held the provision to be violative of Article 15(1), in addition to Articles 14 and 21. In conclusion, the earlier judgments of the Court in Yusuf Abdul Aziz Vs State of Bombay, Sowmithri Vishnu and V Revathi have been overruled. The most detailed of the four judgments ie Justice DY Chandrachud’s opinion, is divided into 8 + 2 parts. He begins with calling out the provision as patriarchal, beneficial for the husband, to secure ownership over the sexuality of his wife and steeped in stereotypes about women and their subordinate role in marriage. The subordination, as per Justice Chandrachud, offends her dignity which is protected under Article 21. However, what stands out in Justice Chandrachud’s judgment, in my opinion, is the acknowledgment of identity, sexuality and agency of a woman. The sexual agency/autonomy and dignity of a woman who participates in the act, as well as the agency of the wife of the man in an adulterous relationship with another woman, to complain about the said act, has been held to be violated by the impugned provisions. The need for protection of agency of the woman has been traced to Article 15 of the Constitution. Justice Indu Malhotra, in her judgment, traces the roots of the law punishing adultery to the ‘Doctrine of Coverture’ of English Ecclesiastical Courts, which stipulated that once married, a woman has no separate identity than her husband. Finding Section 497 to be replete with anomalies and incongruities, the judgment goes on to hold that the discriminatory provision is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, the classification made therein, being no longer relevant or valid. Since the pronouncement of the ‘Right to Privacy’ judgment by the Supreme Court last year, the Court has progressively upheld constitutional rights of identity and dignity to be superior to social notions of morality. The Court has dealt with one archaic and anachronous law at a time, with each judgment paving way for the next. The judgment in Joseph Shine, may sound the death knell for similar obsolete provisions including the Exception to Section 375 which exonerates marital rape. As of now, the adultery verdict seems to have a message for the husband, to let go, and for the participants of the act of adultery – let the truth set you free.

While pronouncing the judgment, CJI Misra said a woman is not inferior to a man and patriarchy cannot be permitted to win over faith, while Justice Chandrachud said to treat women as children of a lesser god is to blink at the Constitution itself.

The Quint,"Asked about the controversy over the Rafale deal, in which the Indian government has maintained that it had no role to play in the choice of an offset partner, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, 26 September, “Prime Minister Modi is right. That’s a government-to-government discussion.” Earlier too, Macron had said that the Rafale deal was a ""government-to-government"" discussion and he was not in power when the multi-billion dollar agreement for 36 fighter jets was signed between India and France. Addressing a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, Macron was asked if the Indian government had at any point told France or Dassault – the French aerospace major – that they had to accept Reliance as the Indian partner for the Rafale deal. India had inked an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore, nearly one- and-half years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the proposal during a visit to Paris. The delivery of the jets is scheduled to begin from September, 2019. This was Macron’s first comment on the issue. Macron, who assumed the presidency in 2017, had emphasised that this is a government-to-government discussion and ""this contract is part of a broader framework which is military and defence"" coalition between India and France. A huge controversy over the Rafale deal has erupted in India after a report in the French media quoted former President Francois Hollande as saying that the selection of the Indian company in the Rafale deal was done at the behest of New Delhi. Hollande said that the Indian government proposed Reliance Defence as the partner for the French aerospace giant in the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale deal and France did not have a choice. The Congress party recently raised several questions about the deal, including the rates, and accused the government of compromising national interest and security while promoting ""crony capitalism"" and causing a loss to the public exchequer. The report quoted Hollande as saying: Prime Minister Modi had announced the procurement of a batch of 36 Rafale jets after holding talks with the then French President Hollande on 10 April 2015 in Paris. The final deal was sealed on 23 September 2016. The French government has said it was in no manner involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners. In its statement, Dassault Aviation said the contract for supply of 36 Rafale jets is a “government-to-government agreement”, adding ""it provides for a separate contract in which Dassault Aviation commits to make compensation investments (offsets) in India worth 50 percent of the value of the purchase."" The company also said its partnership with Reliance has led to the creation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint venture in February 2017. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday, 26 September, declared the Centre's flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid – but struck down some of its provisions, including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions. Among other exceptions was the apex court’s decision to strike down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act. What does it mean? It means that private companies cannot use Aadhaar. The Congress, though silent on other developments, lauded the top court’s decision for the amendment to the Aadhaar Act. Congress president Rahul Gandhi hailed the judgment while slamming the BJP for making Aadhaar an “instrument of oppression”. The BJP, meanwhile, also hailed the Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar as a big victory for the ""pro-poor Modi government"", saying the apex court has upheld the constitutional validity of the scheme and asserted that it does not violate privacy. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said everyone criticising Aadhaar should understand “that they cannot defy technology”. “Mainstream should accept changes, one can understand the fringe being against,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. “Congress cuts a very sorry figure here, they introduced the idea but they did not know what to do with it,” he added. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra hit back at the Congress after it projected the verdict as a slap on the face of the ruling party, saying the order has in fact exposed the opposition party. The Congress favoured middlemen while the Modi government brought Aadhaar to ensure that benefits are given directly to people, he said. That is why, Patra added, the Congress had moved the apex court against it. The court has ruled that Aadhaar is safe. He said the court has noted that Aadhaar gives strength to the poor. The Supreme Court, like the Modi government, has stood with the poor of the country, the BJP leader added. Other BJP leaders also hailed the ‘historic’ judgment. Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “It's a historic judgment. The Supreme Court has clearly said Aadhaar doesn't lead to any kind of surveillance. Aadhaar is constitutionally valid, it empowers the poor with dignity. They have even upheld Aadhaar linking with PAN card.” Lashing out at the BJP dispensation after the verdict, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said that the “majority judgment in the Aadhaar case has retrieved the UPA's original idea of Aadhaar.” He said that several provisions of the Act and the Regulations had been struck down as unconstitutional and that it should serve as “a humbling lesson for the Ministry of Law.” Congress’ Randeep Singh Surjewala said the Supreme Court verdict ""upholds the individual's right to privacy"". Congress’ Kapil Sibal, too, “welcomed” the judgment. He told  , “Striking down linkage of bank accounts with Aadhaar is a very welcome step.” “By striking down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act, the Supreme Court has firmly put an end to the mass surveillance exercise being carried out under the guise of Aadhaar by the central government and the grotesque distortion of an idea conceived by the UPA,” he told  . “However, the passage of the law violates both the fundamental right to privacy and is a gross abuse of the Money Bill route,” he added. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, meanwhile, said Aadhaar on its own was “not the problem”. Speaking to , he said, “The problem is not Aadhaar, but linking of it to various things, where it was not actually needed. The Supreme Court has clarified saying Aadhaar linking is not needed for bank accounts and mobile number.” Several other Congress leaders also spoke on the judgment. “The delinking of Aadhaar from private entities is a 'slap on the face of the BJP’,” said Congress national spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi. He also hailed the Supreme Court's move to disallow metadata to be stored in its current form. Sanjay Jha, national spokeperson for INC India, slammed the Narendra Modi government for collecting citizen’s data while the matter was sub judice. “Dear Citizens of India. Ask (Narendra) Modi to ‘please give my data back’ that has been taken by mobile companies and banks. Why did the government take our Aadhaar information when it was sub judice? Now they already have access to your info. How fair is that? It is daylight robbery,” he said. The Trinamool Congress also hailed the Supreme Court judgment, which struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act that allowed corporate entities to access its data. A   released by the party after the judgment read: “SC strikes down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act, 2016. So you don’t need to give your Aadhaar to private bodies like banks, schools, mobile companies. Trinamool and Mamata Banerjee fought hard for this.” “Mamata Banerjee had issued an open challenge on Aadhaar. Our stance has been vindicated. I'm glad the SC said what it said. On data privacy and data protection, that's also something we need to take a close look at, so the BJP can't make it into a policed state,” TMC’s Derek O'Brien told ANI.

Srinivas Kodali ,"The constitutional validity of Aadhaar has been upheld by the Supreme Court of India. The judgment agrees with UIDAI’s submissions, that the security of Aadhaar data is ensured at every stage of enrolment and storage. Majority judges also agree with UIDAI on how surveillance is not possible by UIDAI or any of the entities regulated under the Aadhaar Act, with minimal collection of data. However, without a legal definition of surveillance, one can argue that any form of tracking which may cause potential harm to an individual, can be considered ‘surveillance’. Surveillance comes in many forms; even people looking at you with their eyes is referred to as natural surveillance in urban studies. American author and activist Jane Jacobs always believed natural surveillance can be used in urban planning and design to reduce crime by making people look at the surroundings. Not all forms of surveillance are intrusive in nature, but any form of mass surveillance or surveillance without legal sanctions are bad in a democracy. Many states like  ,  ,   and 13 other states have been building State Resident Data Hubs and are increasingly collecting information of citizens with the purpose of electronic governance and ‘good governance’. Aadhaar to them is an important asset and has eased the task of linking various databases to build profiles of citizens to track whether they pay taxes or not. But this building of profiles has crossed the limits of legitimate state interest and has brought in concepts of 360-degree profiles. Andhra Pradesh is championing this cause and wants to track every governance activity and citizen real-time, for real-time governance. The Andhra Pradesh real-time governance operating system  (e-progress) mandatorily uses Aadhaar and includes a 360-degree database which is part of its architecture called  A presentation on   presented to the Cabinet by UIDAI part-time Chairman J. Satyanarayana shows its architecture, and how it will be a single source of truth about citizens to the government. Accordingly, Andhra Pradesh has used a statewide survey to collect personal information of residents including geotagged information of their residential address using Aadhaar eKYC. All of the Aadhaar data collected for   under various schemes by the Government of Andhra Pradesh has been published by them, effectively leaking it to everyone on the Internet. A look at some of these leaks shows us that any non-state actor on the internet could have built a surveillance database using this information. All these Aadhaar-based profiles and many more such databases are linked to create 360-degree profiles by Andhra Pradesh government. This case has shown the problems with Aadhaar which UIDAI and government won’t accept. The thin line between governance and surveillance is decreasing with the information the government is collecting and linking with the help of Aadhaar. So effectively, surveillance becomes a form of governance and the courts are approving this form of governance. ’ (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"Most of the candidates who filed nomination papers for phase one of the urban local bodies (ULB) elections in south Kashmir are likely to be declared as ‘elected uncontested’ due to the lukewarm response, unprecedented in all the post-1990 democratic exercises in the Valley. Last date for filing of nominations in the 149 wards of phase one in 13 ULBs, including three of the 74 wards of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, was Tuesday, 25 September. The process had begun with the first notification on 18 September. Candidates can withdraw nominations till 28 September, and the polling, if necessary, is scheduled to be held on 8 October. Both the major regional parties, Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are boycotting the current municipal and panchayat elections. They have made it clear that they would not participate in the elections until the Government of India and the governor’s administration make it unequivocally clear, with a commitment in the Supreme Court and outside, that they would uphold Article 35A that grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir. “We have been asked not to share even the number of the candidates contesting, let alone identity of the candidates,” one of the DCs asserted on condition of anonymity. “This is a breach of the rules which make it mandatory to make the details public, but it has become more important to ensure safety and security of the candidates,” said the DC. Officials at Directorate of Information said the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Shaleen Kabra’s did not share with them any detail, other than the notifications issued for different phases of the staggered polling process. Babu Ram, Deputy Director Information at the CEO’s office, claimed that he had no access to the information regarding details in the Valley. No press release about the number of candidates in the Valley was issued either by the CEO or Directorate of Information. According to official sources, only 50 candidates have filed papers in 49 wards in south Kashmir. In the 13 wards in Kulgam, just six candidates have filed papers in six wards. Not one has filed nomination in rest of the seven wards. In the eight wards in Devsar, nine candidates have filed papers. Six candidates have filed papers in the seven wards in Qazigund. In Achhabal, nine candidates have filed papers in eight wards. Kokernag is better off with 20 candidates in 13 wards. The dismal response makes it clear that almost all these candidates would be declared as returned uncontested, while several wards would go unrepresented. “There is possibility of polling in just a few wards in Kokernag. We don’t know if anybody would turn up to cast a vote”, said an official. Situation is a little better in the north Kashmir districts of Baramulla, Kupwara and Bandipora, where 160 candidates have filed nominations in 64 wards for phase one. In the 17 wards in Bandipora, 48 candidates (17 each from the Congress and the BJP, and 14 independent) have filed papers. In the 21 wards in Baramulla, 40 candidates (Congress 21, BJP 13, independent six) have filed nominations. In the 13 wards in Kupwara, there are 43 nominations (Congress eight, BJP six and independent 29). Of them, around 20 are believed to be affiliated to PDP’s Rajya Sabha member Fayaz Ahmad Mir and former BJP ally Peoples Conference (PC) Sajjad Lone. In the 13 wards in Handwara, 29 candidates have reportedly filed nomination papers. One of them has a ticket from the Congress and seven from the BJP, while 21 are independent. Thirteen of them are believed to be affiliated to PC. Officials said the PC, which is a registered party but not recognised by Election Commission of India, has submitted three symbols and requested the CEO that one of these be allotted to its nominees. In the 2014 Assembly elections, two of PC’s candidates, including Lone, had been returned from Handwara and Kupwara segments of Kupwara district.

Another relic of colonial rule in India, the adultery law has been seen as gravely misogynistic by many. The petitioners in this case seem to be taking a cue from our ancestors. Author Gurcharan Das, whose latest book,  has been released recently, narrates a tale from the   to show how polygamy was the norm till certain laws were imposed on society.

Shwetaketu suddenly sees his mother going out with a different man every night, to find her coming home in the morning.” One day, Shwetaketu can't stand it anymore and confronts his father, “don't you have a problem with your wife going out with different men?” To his surprise his father says, “No son. This is how the world has always been. Human beings are polygamous.” “Now of course, Shwetaketu grows up and becomes an important figure and he’s the one who enacts monogamy in the world,” says Das. “This (adultery law) is a remnant of our colonial past and proof of the fact that we’ve been brainwashed. This law has been removed from the books in England but it’s still there in our books.

Gurcharan Das also said, “A lot of harm was done by Manu, just as harm was done by the medieval Christian law books and even Islam which stated that the woman, the adulteress, ought to be stoned to death.” “So it’s everywhere,” Das says about underlying misogyny in many religious scriptures. He also observes, “The funny part is that the man can go to jail but the woman can’t because the woman is the property of the husband.

Mohan Guruswamy,"I have known and seen at least 10 prime ministers of India, and can safely testify that except for Dr Manmohan Singh, none of the others was upright. So let us not perpetuate the myth of an incorruptible prime minister. They are all men of the world. This is why defence deals play such a major role in our politics. Like petroleum taxes, it makes for ‘easy collection’ of money. According to SIPRI, India is the fifth largest military spender (2016) in the world and the largest importer of arms, accounting for 13 percent of the world’s total imports between 2012 and 2016. As much as 70 percent of India’s arms are imported. India’s first big-ticket military purchase was for de Havilland Vampire jets in November 1948. VK Krishna Menon, India’s first High Commissioner in London, engineered this deal. After that, India ordered several hundred Ouragans and Mystere fighters from France, Fairchild C-119G Packet transports from the USA, Hawker Hunter fighter-bombers, and English Electric Canberra bombers. Most of these were ad hoc purchases, and it was always speculated that some money changed hands to facilitate these deals. The only deals that didn’t have intermediaries were the government-to-government purchases from the former Soviet Union. 1970s onwards, there was the advent of arms deals which were major sources of slush funds for buyers, sellers, middlemen and everyone else in between. The first major deal that went this way was the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar deep-penetration strike aircraft in 1978, when Jagjivan Ram was the Defence Minister. These payments typically go three ways: one tranche to the Indian decision-makers, the second to the middlemen and the third to officials in the French establishment and manufacturers. This is a well-honed European practice. But how much more are we paying for the “new” Rafale jets is important. There is much noise about the huge costs at which the 36 Rafales have been contracted for. The comparable costs of the 126 and 36 deals can only be read when all the costs are factored in. The cost of the new deal for 36 Rafales is 3.42 billion euros – the cost of bare planes; 1.8 billion euros for associated supplies for infrastructure and support; 1.7 billion euros for India-specific changes; and 353 million euros for “performance-based logistics support” – with the weapons package of 700 million euros being the extra. What is new here are the performance-based logistics support and weapons package. So take out 1,053 million euros out and you have the comparable cost, which means it is 7.1 billion euros. The first MMRCA deal would also have included India-specific specifications, as in the case of IAF’s SU-30 MKIs. For comparison’s sake, the argument can be that 36 Rafales now cost 7.1 billion euros, while 126 Rafales in 2012 cost 7.75 billion euros. Clearly, a huge cushioning has been provisioned to meet the needs of all the parties concerned. Look at these other facts now. According to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Reliance Defence Ltd was registered on 28 March 2015. Government officials insisted that 74 percent of the offsets would be exported, earning 3 billion euros for the country in the next seven years. The experience with all offsets suggests that this is far-fetched. It has not happened so far. In the AgustaWestland offsets, investigators discovered money trails from Mauritius, Singapore, the UAE, Tunisia, the UK and British Virgin Islands linking the agents and the manufacturer. I will bet that Reliance Defence, a company registered just 14 days before the Modi-Hollande deal, was meant to create a pathway for “offsets” to come back into Indian hands for politics and business. Recently, IDBI Bank filed an insolvency application before the National Company Law Tribunal seeking debt resolution of Reliance Naval and Engineering, the shipbuilding Anil Ambani company, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Yet, Reliance Defence is so confident about fulfilling its Rafale-related obligations. I suspect there are no obligations. Reliance Defence is just a pass-through.

Pawan Khera,"Of all the seasons, Fall plays a unique role. Fall starts revealing the true character of denuded trees. This year, Fall in Europe has shown its colours in Delhi – 12,000 kms away from France. From the conflicting versions of India’s Raksha Mantri and Finance Minister, it was clear that not only was the Modi government concealing facts, it also did not know how to escape its own web of lies. When confronted with the vast price difference – from 526 crore per aircraft to 1,670 crore per aircraft – the first defence of the government was ‘secrecy clause’, which ostensibly did not permit the government to reveal to the Indian taxpayer how much of their money was being spent on procurement of fighter planes. More importantly, both Reliance Defence and Dassault have mentioned the price per aircraft. The government should invoke the so-called ‘secrecy clause’ and file a case against both of them. Another argument that came as an afterthought to Nirmala Sitharaman was that the UPA regime was getting a cheaper deal because those aircrafts did not have weaponry. Perhaps the Prime Minister did not share the India-France joint statement dated 10 April 2015 which clearly states ‘the aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the same configuration as had been tested and approved by Indian Airforce’. Thus, it is clear that for 526 crore, the UPA government was getting fully-loaded aircrafts as per the Air Staff Quality Requirement (ASQR) along with technology. For 1,670 crore, we are now getting a fully-loaded aircraft as per identical ASQR, but   the transfer of technology. While Sitharaman justifies the steep price gap citing mythical difference in configuration, Arun Jaitley claimed that the basic plane bought by Modi was 9 percent cheaper than the UPA deal and was overall 20 percent cheaper. Both the esteemed ministers forgot Manohar Parrikar’s statement in April 2015 that the cost of 126 fully loaded aircrafts was roughly 90,000 crores. When we asked the government the basis on which HAL was replaced with Reliance Defence, we were told by Nirmala Sitharaman on 12 February 2018 that no such offset contract had been awarded. Interestingly, on 27 October 2017, Ms Florence Parly, the Defence Minister of France, laid the foundation of Reliance factory in Nagpur. She had met Ms Sitharaman the same morning. We are then told that under the offset policy, an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is free to choose its partner(s), with the government having no role to play. The truth is, the offset partners of the OEM need to be approved by the Ministry of Defence. The DG Acquisition has to then constitute an evaluation committee to go into both the financial as well as technical proposals, following which the MoD has to approve the offset partners. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Law and Justice of India, tried to deceive the nation when he claimed that the negotiations between Dassault and Reliance dated to 2012. As Law Minister, he did not produce any documentary evidence to support this bizarre claim. He merely quoted a newspaper report. Surely Prasad knows that it was Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries that was in talks with Dassault, and   Anil Ambani. The then UPA government made it clear to Dassault that the tender for the procurement clearly stated that aerospace PSU HAL would be the partner in the deal. The UPA government negotiated a deal that was not only cheaper, but for 560 crore per aircraft; India would have also bought the technology. Modi negotiated a deal under which we ended up paying 1,670 crore per aircraft and still did not get the technology. The government has not responded to this critical aspect of the deal which undermines its own stated motto of ‘Make in India’. When cornered by such damning information and questions on replacing HAL, a Navratna company with 70 years of experience in aircraft manufacturing and maintenance, Sitharaman had another gem as an argument – that HAL did not have the capability to manufacture. It was bravely countered by the former boss of HAL, Suvarna Raju. Just 15 days before the Prime Minister visited France along with Anil Ambani, Éric Trappier, CEO of Dassault Aviation announced on 25 March 2015, that his company and HAL had resolved the issue of warranties, and that 95 percent of the deal was complete and the remaining 5 percent would be finalised soon. The UPA regime has been accused of not finalising the deal in 10 years. The Indian Airforce was asked by the Ministry of Defence in 2004-5 to prepare a tender for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. The IAF prepared the tender in 2007. These tenders involving such expensive equipment take time as our forces have to research and identify a compatible technology. In 2008, there were 6 bidders. Again, the IAF had to evaluate 6 different planes based on 643 technical parameters. This evaluation was completed in 2011. Rafale was L1 and the tender was finalised on 12 December 2012. Not even one minister of the Modi government has yet responded to some critical questions. So perhaps the answer lies in Hollande’s revelation. One would think that this was an arrogant government that refused to answer questions raised by the opposition on Rafale. This false bravado, where the defence minister of the country resorts to hashtags instead of clearly responding to questions; where the finance minister, instead of responding to questions on Rafale, makes personal attacks on those who question; where the prime minister of the country has a lot to hide – to begin with, his face from the brave Indian Army that is starved of equipment and the tax payers of this country who ask ‘why are you paying 300 percent extra per aircraft, why are you procuring only 36 aircrafts when the Army requires 126, Mr Prime Minister?’ For Narendra Modi, it appears, “all at once Summer collapsed into Fall”.

Shashi Tharoor,"If there was any doubt that this government has a tin ear for how its initiatives sound, it was dispelled this week when the University Grants Commission (UGC) asked educational institutes to observe 'Surgical Strikes Day' on 29 September. The idea fell with a thud upon the unwary and struck the public as painfully as any surgery. Soon after it came to power, this government had offended Christians (and any officials who enjoyed their holidays) by declaring 25 December to be “Good Governance Day”. But the government has apparently learned little from its mistakes. Not only will 'Surgical Strikes Day' be commemorated on 29 September, but Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced that three days of events will be conducted around the nation from 28 September to 30 September to honour the valour of our soldiers, including parades, lectures, and a three-day exhibition at India Gate. No government has ever been more shameless in the milking of India’s military for political benefit as this one, but this cynical exercise takes the proverbial cake. We all know that, responding to repeated cross-border raids from Pakistan, the Indian Army had conducted what were dubbed “surgical strikes on terrorist launch pads” across the Line of Control on 29 September 2016. This kind of pre-emptive action had been undertaken several times before by our army with no publicity, but the BJP government, anxious to live up to its belligerent past rhetoric, decided to beat the tom-toms. The evocative term “surgical strike” was used; posters and hoardings went up hailing the government’s action; the military was brazenly instrumentalised in the BJP’s campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections two months later. Extravagant claims were made that the strikes had put an end to cross-border terror. They didn’t. Terrorist attacks resumed; all the problems that the “surgical strikes” had supposedly resolved continued unabated. Pakistani shelling and attacks along the LoC never ceased, causing a large number of civilian deaths and many victims among our security personnel. The Indian raid was a response to an attack on Uri, but soon afterward, our base in Nagrota was attacked, killing seven. But this government is utterly shameless. Having mounted its propaganda coup, it could not let go. Two years later, it was clear that people were in danger of forgetting its great (albeit hollow) military triumph. Hence the fatuous pronouncement this week that we must all observe 'Surgical Strikes Day'. Genuine patriots must be squirming at the prospect. First of all, the Indian military has many great achievements – the defence of Srinagar at the time of Kashmir’s accession, the liberation of Bangladesh, the takeovers of Hyderabad and Goa, the captures of the Zoji La and Haji Pir passes, forestalling a coup in the Maldives, wresting back the heights above Kargil – which had a lasting strategic impact and deserve far greater celebration by the country. The incursion of two years ago was neither new, nor decisive, nor exceptional, not even surgical, but it was used then to drum up patriotic fervour behind the Modi government – and it is being resurrected for the same purpose today. This is a disservice to the genuine heroism of the army, to the history of our country and to the common sense of all Indians. Why has the UGC, which not too long ago was rightly slated for abolition, taken up the cause of publicity for the Modi government, with greater zeal than judgement? Very simple: Because it is the pet poodle of the government, its woebegone performance revealing yet again the total lack of autonomy of our higher educational institutions and of those meant to regulate them. Ironically, the UGC-prescribed syllabi in India’s institutions of higher learning do not include military history; the genuine military accomplishments of the Indian army are not studied at our universities. Yet the UGC now demands that one minor episode in our glorious military history be celebrated on the very campuses that do not study the major ones. The real problem is that we have a government singularly bereft of achievement over the last four and a half years of its misrule, which therefore feels obliged to invent triumphs that don’t exist in order to have something to celebrate. Let us not forget that in contrast to the many military victories that embellish India’s post-Independence history, the so-called surgical strikes were a strategic failure. Celebrating them discredits the UGC, misuses the army, misleads the public and mindlessly confuses shallow jingoism with real nationalism. There’s only one possible explanation for this bizarrerie. Elections must be near. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Pushan Das,"As claims and counterclaims over the financial terms of India’s deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter aircrafts from France continue relentlessly, the Indian Airforce (IAF) continues to be in desperate need of new fighter jets. The asymmetric inequalities between the IAF and the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) are set to widen. For the IAF to attain the combat capability to counter and fight any future war or conflict vis-à-vis the PLAAF, the acquisition of aircrafts like the Rafale will be crucial to expanding its air combat capability. The IAF has consistently insisted that it needs the Rafale aircrafts to shore up its dwindling squadron numbers. It has projected a need for 42 fighter aircraft squadrons to be ready to fight a two-front war. That threat perception stems from a defence ministry directive. The Rafale with its India-specific enhancements, maneuverability, ability to super-cruise (fly at supersonic speed without using afterburners), and take on large weapons, outclasses most combat aircrafts that the IAF would have to face in the subcontinent. The figure of 126 aircrafts was arrived at after much analysis to replace older generation Russian jets that were set to retire. The most significant downside of the arrangement made by Prime Minister Modi was its preclusion of any option for a follow-on procurement of any additional Rafales by India at the same price agreed to in principle – the contract the two countries signed on 23 September 2015 included no provision for any purchases beyond the 36 aircrafts already agreed to, meaning that any desired subsequent buy would have to be renegotiated at a new price. After setting aside some plans for maintenance and availability of parts and training requirements, only a few aircrafts will be available operationally. Additionally, given the poor serviceability which plagues the Su-30MKI and the disappointing delivery schedule of the indigenously-built Tejas, the struggle with a significant number of obsolete second and third generation aircrafts like the MIG-21 and 27, it seems intuitive that India needs to consider a broader range of options beyond the acquisition of just 36 Rafales. Unfortunately, the current political climate rules out this possibility for the IAF, which was fairly confident of a follow-on order. The IAF’s originally declared requirement for 126 to 200 new fighters remains exactly the same now as it was at the start, when the MMRCA requirement was first enunciated over a decade ago. The IAF should also prioritise updating existing fourth generation fighters with high-speed standoff weaponry and electronic warfare capabilities, all of which will be key to survivability and expanding capabilities vis-à-vis threats from Chinese combat aircraft and air defence systems. Whatever course of action the IAF and the Indian government may ultimately choose to take in this regard, the stakes have become unprecedentedly high at a time when the IAF sorely needs such a continued recapitalisation effort to get its fighter squadron strength back up to a more reassuring level. The Rafale will fill a crucial gap left by diminishing combat-mass and ageing legacy fleets, and the late arrival of next-generation aircrafts. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Anthony Rozario,"Striking down Section 33 (2) of the Aadhaar Act 2016 – which allows a Joint Secretary to access an individual’s Aadhaar data on grounds of national security – the Supreme Court on Wednesday, 26 September 2018, said that vesting “such an important power in the hands of Joint Secretary may not be appropriate.” Maintaining that disclosure of a person’s Aadhaar data in matters of national interest cannot be disputed, the apex court felt that the decision to access an individual’s data should come from a “higher ranking officer (above joint secretary) along with, preferably, a Judicial Officer.” The order, however, left it open for the Centre to enact the above-mentioned suggestions. Earlier, Section 33 (2) of the Aadhaar Act 2016, allowed a “disclosure of information, including identity information or authentication records, made in the interest of national security in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India specially authorised in this behalf by an order of the Central government.” Further, Section 33 (2) of the same Act reads that “every direction issued under this sub-section, shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the Government of India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, before it takes effect.” Wednesday's order, therefore, means that a Joint Secretary to the Union Government can no longer gain access to a person’s Aadhaar data on grounds of national security. The apex court has clearly said that a decision in this regard should be taken by a higher ranking official – but such a change in the law can only be brought about by the Centre through legislation. The apex court’s order also read down Section of 33 (1) of the Aadhaar Act 2016, which allowed a District Judge to obtain a person’s Aadhaar information, after giving the Aadhaar authority the chance of a hearing. The order now makes it mandatory for a District Judge to give a hearing to the person whose Aadhaar data the court wants to access. Earlier, section 33(1) of Aadhaar Act 2016 read that “any disclosure of information, including identity information or authentication records, made pursuant to an order of a court not inferior to that of a District Judge: Provided that no order by the court under this sub-section shall be made without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Authority.” Wednesday’s order, therefore, empowers an individual, bestowing upon him the right to be heard before his Aadhaar data is accessed by the court of a District Judge.

The Quint,"Addressing a rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday slammed the Congress for its electoral failures and said that the 125-year-old party was trying to form an ‘international alliance’ in a bid to topple the NDA government. He also said that the Congress was indulging in mud-slinging against the government because the party finds it easier than debating issues like development, in an apparent reference to allegations over the Rafale deal. Modi alleged that the Congress and other Opposition parties were pursuing vote bank politics which had destroyed the country like ""termites”. “The UPA government never allowed a BJP-led state to function. Congress has only divided the nation. We must eliminate vote bank politics,"" Modi said. Addressing a workers' meet in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Modi also attacked the Congress for the instant triple talaq issue. ""They (Opposition) are doing it just for the sake of saving their chair even at the cost of damaging the social fabric. But we believe in ' ',"" he said. Referring to the instant triple talaq issue, Modi said the practice is not acceptable even in Islamic countries. The Congress had earlier accused the Modi government of treating the issue of instant triple talaq ""more as a political football than a matter of justice to Muslim women"". In a direct attack at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Modi said that the Rahul-led Congress and its workers should introspect why the party is in this condition now. “We lost in 1984. But we didn't criticise EVM machines. We looked inwards instead,"" he said. The 125-year-old party had been reduced to such a condition that it was “begging” small parties for alliances, he added. He said that the party was only focussed on divisive vote bank politics and not on development. ""But I want to tell them, the more you throw mud at us, the more the lotus (the BJP’s symbol) will bloom.” “The UPA government never allowed a BJP-led state to function.

PTI,"The country is missing the wisdom of Manmohan Singh at a time the economy is in the hands of the ""economically unsound leadership"", MNS chief Raj Thackeray said on Wednesday, 26 September while praising the former prime minister on his birthday.

AP,"President Donald Trump and his top national security aides lashed out at Iran with unusual venom on Tuesday, 25 September severe consequences if it defied the United States. Speeches by the president before the UN General Assembly and by national security adviser John Bolton to an organization that opposed the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which the Trump administration withdrew in May, appeared to mark an escalation of rhetoric. Trump blasted what he called Iran's ""corrupt dictatorship"" and accused its leaders of enriching themselves through massive embezzlement and raiding state coffers to spread ""mayhem"" across the Middle East and around the world. Bolton warned Iran that there would be ""hell to pay"" if it crossed the U.S. or its allies and partners. Trump also vowed to continue to isolate Iran through US sanctions that are being re-instated following his withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. The next round of sanctions will take effect in early November. He later predicted that the pressure from renewed sanctions would force Iran back to the table to negotiate. ""Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,"" the president told the UN General Assembly in a 34-minute speech that was more critical of Iran than any other country. In an even more fiery speech to a group opposed to the Iran deal, Bolton was to go further. ""If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay,"" he was to say according to prepared remarks released by the White House. ""The murderous regime and its supporters will face significant consequences if they do not change their behavior. Let my message today be clear: We are watching, and we will come after you,"" Bolton was to say, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also to speak at the event hosted by United Against a Nuclear Iran being held to coincide with UN General Assembly. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who also addressed the UN, launched a scathing attack on Trump and his administration for abandoning international norms and imposing sanctions that amount to ""economic terrorism."" He accused the US of pressuring and threatening supporters of the Iran nuclear deal. ""The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian,"" Rouhani said. Trump and his aides, meanwhile, stepped up their attacks on the nuclear deal, which was a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration. Trump called it ""horrible"" and maintained that many Middle Eastern countries had supported the decision to withdraw. In fact, only Israel and Gulf Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates enthusiastically backed the move. The other parties to the deal, under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, remain in the agreement and met on Monday in New York to reaffirm their support for it. Aside from Iran, the other participants are Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union. After that meeting, the top diplomats from those countries and the EU agreed to establish a financial facility in the European Union to facilitate payments for Iranian imports and exports including oil, a key move sought by Tehran as it attempts to fight back against the re-imposed US sanctions. They said in a joint statement that the so-called ""Special Purpose Vehicle"" will ""assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran."" Trump said the deal was a ""windfall"" for Iran's leaders, who used billions in sanctions relief to boost their military budget, increase repression, fund terrorism, havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen and enrich themselves. His comments on embezzlement by Iranian authorities come after Rouhani's government publicized details of the country's budget for the first time. That budget revealed large increases in funding for religious foundations that are a key part of the clerical state-above-the-state, which receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the public coffers. Those foundations, including religious schools and charities, are tied closely to powerful clerics and often serve as machines for patronage and propaganda to build support for their authority. Trump's speech followed a tweet in which he said that wouldn't meet Rouhani on the sidelines of the General Assembly — although he said he was sure Rouhani ""is an absolutely lovely man!"" Trump later told reporters that ""everything about Iran is failing right now."" He described its inflation as the worst in the world and its currency, which is trading at all-time lows against the dollar, as a ""disaster."" Trump, speaking to reporters as he met with Colombia's president, said Iran's leadership will ""at some point"" want to talk or risk exacerbating its economic crisis.

Ravi Joshi,"The decisive mandate against President Yameen on 25 September, in the Presidential elections in the Maldives, is an emphatic assertion of people’s will to return to democracy and the rule of law. This, despite several attempts by President Yameen to muzzle the press, scare the Opposition into submission through repeated police raids on their offices, and the arrest of dozens of Opposition MPs and last minute instructions to the Election Commission to distort the counting process. Well before the elections, Yameen had debarred his most important rival and former President Mohammed Nasheed on trumped charges of terrorism, who was forced to go into exile in Colombo. Similar was the fate of another important contender – Gasim Ibrahim – who was charged along with a former defence minister, of plotting to overthrow the government, which forced him to go into exile as well. It was utterly ironic that Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Yameen’s half brother who did the utmost to ensure President Yameen’s rise to power in the most foul manner in the last elections of 2013, had become a thorn in the side of Yameen within the last two years. That showed the degree to which Yameen had degenerated in his lust for power. All this came to a head in June 2018 when Yameen ordered the arrest of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and another senior judge, both of whom had issued a decree to release all the political prisoners, including Nasheed and Gasim Ibrahim – since their detention was found to be in violation of the rule of law. Soon after, that the 82-year-old Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was also arrested. This high-handed treatment of the Opposition by Yameen came as a boon to the people who were protesting for months on end in front of the president’s office on the one and only thorough fare in the Capital – the Majeedi Magu. The events of June 2018 became the glue to bind the Opposition, and as Nasheed, Gasim, and Maummon, all old rivals united to fight the common enemy of the people. They jointly put up a single candidate – Ibrahim Solih, the right hand man of Nasheed and the most sober and moderate face of the Maldivian Democratic Party to fight Yameen. Now that President Yameen has publicly accepted the peoples’ mandate and has conceded defeat, the earlier fears that he would clamp down an emergency and nullify the vote in case it went against him, may be put to rest. He is expected to hand over power in November when his term officially ends. The unexpected victory of Ibrahim Solih should come as a great relief and as a boost to India’s efforts to strengthen its partnerships in the neighbourhood. It must however be said that New Delhi in the last four years earned no laurels for its role in the island nation. It was often seen on the side of the dictator rather than on the side of the democratic forces. So much so that whenever former President Nasheed or senior office bearers of the Maldivian Democratic Party visited New Delhi, no one in our Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) nor the PM’s Office were willing to meet them. Were they afraid of earning the wrath of a tin pot dictator ruling an area smaller than RK Puram in Delhi? Worse was the report that New Delhi had promised China that it would not interfere in the internal affairs of the Maldives following the arrest of the Chief Justice of Supreme Court and former President Maumoon Abdul Gayyom in June 2018. Well before all this, from 2016 onwards, President Yameen steadily shifted the ‘India First’ policy to ‘China First’. This, as he handed over some of the strategic islands in the Northern atoll of the country, closest to India’s territorial waters to the Chinese government, to build, repair and refuel stations to their naval ships. Later in December 2017, Yameen during his visit to Beijing, signed the Free Trade Agreement with China and declared his intent to join the Belt Road Initiative. This encouraged the Chinese to invest heavily in infrastructure projects in the country. Significant among them was a massive loan of USD 830 million to upgrade the Hulhulé Island airport and link it with the Capital Malé through a 1.3 mile long sea-bridge at a cost of USD 400 million. Merely servicing the debt, about USD 92 million a year (roughly 10 percent of the GDP) would be quite a drain on the internal revenues of the country. Such being the situation, former president Nasheed, who would be a key figure in guiding the new government, has already called for an audit of all the infrastructure projects contracted out to China. Whatever be the intent of the new government, the harsh economic reality the country faces due to five years of Yameen’s misrule and the mortgaging of strategic assets of the country to China, may be hard to reverse.

The Quint,"The Aadhaar system has a  , with the UIDAI database within the easy reach of hackers, and user data being accessible by almost anyone, with little time, money, and effort. However, like demonetisation and the ‘Digital India’ movement, which were both very ambitious, the bigger question is this: Is the world’s  ? And  ? These are some of the most unusual instances of Aadhaar misuse, irregularities, or failure to provide the same essential services it set out to, that raise the question, “Are we really ready for Aadhaar, India?” In south Delhi’s Kusumpur Pahari slum, the Aadhaar-based distribution of rations had made life difficult for hundreds of families. When   in March, it was found that some residents were faced with ‘biometric authentication failure’. Along with that, activists also pointed out that there was pilferage of grains by ration shop owners. “The government is saying that Aadhaar has to be made mandatory to fight corruption, and to make sure that services reach the most deserving. But if you look at what is happening on the grounds, it is far from what the government claims. Giving an Aadhaar number and linking it with the PDS is not going to help fight corruption,” said RTI activist Anjali Bhardwaj, who is also a member of the Satark Nagrik Sangathan. In yet another revelation that raised worries about the privacy of our Aadhaar data,   in March this year that a simple Google search would lead you to the Aadhaar details of several individuals. These details, including their name, address, Aadhaar number, date of birth and photograph, were made publicly accessible on the internet for no clear reason. Thankfully, the biometric details were not available. Ironically enough, the Aadhaar tagline “ ” was part of the search query that revealed the data. Now if you thought your Aadhaar data was only in the hands of those authorised to access the official Aadhaar database, you are wrong. Following up on an investigation by  ,   in January this year that completely random people like you and me, with no official credentials, could access and become admins of the official Aadhaar database (with names, mobile numbers, addresses of every Indian linked to the UIDAI scheme). But that was not even the worst part. Once you were an admin, you could choose anyone else as an admin of the portal. You could be an Indian, you could be a foreign national, none of it mattered – the Aadhaar database never asked. A person of your choosing could then have access to the data of all Aadhaar cardholders. In January 2018,  news reported an instance where a 28-year-old pregnant housemaid from Chandigarh was refused an ultrasonography by a government doctor, because she didn’t have an Aadhaar, according to a paper published in the  . The 28-year-old woman, weighing 45 kilos and already a mother of three, was refused an oral abortion drug without an ultrasonography due to the non-availability of an Aadhaar card. She was later forced to go to a quack, and due to a botched up abortion procedure, she was hospitalised and had to undergo blood transfusion. In January this year,  documenting how details under 1 billion Aadhaar numbers could be easily accessed by paying a measly sum of Rs 500 to anonymous sellers who offered their services through WhatsApp. By entering the Aadhaar number on a portal,   reporter had access to the name, address, postal code (PIN), photo, phone number and email of any individual concerned. On 16 January 2018, the   reported the story of 10-year-old Indu, a Dalit student from Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh, who lost her scholarship because of a spelling error in her Aadhaar. SC/ST/OBC students in Andhra Pradesh are entitled to a government scholarship of Rs 1,200 per year. However, Indu’s name was spelled wrong on her Aadhaar card as ‘Hindu,’ and she was told to rectify the error. However, despite her parents and school seeking a new card and re-registering their daughter’s information, her name was spelled ‘Hindu’ in the new Aadhaar as well. Her date of birth and photograph were updated though. Twitter handle   shared a video from a ration shop in Delhi that copes with connectivity issues by hanging the biometric reader machine at a nearby tree, where it receives network. In Delhi’s East Mehram Nagar, a ration shop falls in an area with little internet network. But Aadhaar officials have directed the ration shopkeeper to ensure the biometric machine works effectively. To resolve this issue, the biometrics machine is hung from a nearby Jamun tree to access the network to be able to ensure people get their rations. Twitter user   took to social media platform to express her shock and outrage regarding a peculiar matter. When she went to link her Aadhaar to her mobile phone number, she discovered that her Aadhaar had been linked to not one or two, but NINE SIM cards already. After the worried citizen took to social media to air her concern, the UIDAI’s response was a statement on Twitter – that at least she knows how many others had illegally linked their SIM cards to her Aadhaar. In response to this story by  , Bharti Airtel responded that the issue has since been resolved, and provided this clarification. Gaurav Pandhi, a Congress leader and former banker, complained that his bank account had been linked to his Aadhaar without his permission. In a report, Pandhi said he received a message from ICICI bank’s Paschim Vihar branch in New Delhi on 15 January, which said his Aadhaar linking request had been received, and that it would be completed in a few days. Decidedly upset, he took to Twitter to call out the unsolicited linking of his biometric data to his bank account. In October 2015,   reported about a 33-year-old man who was arrested by the Hyderabad Police for luring and assaulting young girls under the pretext of being an education counsellor. The accused, Kalakanda Madhu, a former manager at the Food Corporation of India, purchased copies of strangers’ Aadhaar cards, and would get SIM cards issued by furnishing copies of strangers’ Aadhaar as proof of address and ID. After his arrest, police said that he had access to over 5,000 young girls’s data and would call them from different phone numbers he’d received by furnishing proof from strangers’ Aadhaar IDs. In another instance reported by   on 22 January 2018, a woman complained about how they had trouble getting their food and other rations, because the biometrics machine fails in the winter. When the skin on their fingertips cracks in the the cold season, the machine reportedly fails to accurately read their fingerprints. As a result, they’re denied access to their rations. A woman died in Sonipat, Haryana after reportedly   for not having an Aadhaar card. The woman, Shakuntala – the wife of a Kargil martyr – was accompanied by her son to a private hospital on 28 December 2017, for treatment. The hospital authorities reportedly insisted that her Aadhaar card be submitted for her to receive treatment. The report adds that hospital authorities did not relent despite the patient's son Pawan Kumar showing the copy of the Aadhaar card, including the number, on his mobile phone. A renowned government hospital in Bhopal had come up with a rule in April 2017, making it mandatory for parents to make an Aadhaar card for their newborn before being discharged,  . The rule was apparently made after an order from the district administration, but the parents did not take it too kindly, especially because the names of the babies are often changed after birth.

Priyale Chandra,"Abhishek Sharma Congress President Rahul Gandhi tore into the Narendra Modi government over the Rafale deal during his tour in parliamentary constituency Amethi. Saying that in the coming months, his party will expose how every initiative under the present government has been an act of theft, Rahul said the ""fun has just begun"". Gandhi alleged that the country's ""chowkidar"", Narendra Modi, had snatched money away from the poor and martyrs and handed it over to industrialist Anil Ambani. The Congress chief arrived in Amethi for a two-day visit on Monday, the first after his Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, and said the people of the country want to know the amount involved in the Rafale deal. He also claimed that based on former French President Hollande’s interview, it was clear that the Modi government had handed the contract to Anil Ambani. Rahul Gandhi also claimed that the Modi government has gone back on election promises like providing employment and sending money in bank accounts of the people. On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi sent out an emotional tweet honouring the Air Force and the workers of HAL, saying that they (the Congress) will bring justice to those who have stolen from our soldiers. The tweet is being seen as Gandhi’s attempt to give an emotional angle to his badgering of the Modi government’s dealing with the purchase of Rafale jets from France. Gandhi had earlier said the “PM has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers” when former French President Francois Hollande’s statement on the Rafale deal surfaced, saying that Anil Ambani’s Reliance was pitched as a local partner by the Indian government.

The Quint,"On Wednesday, 26 September, the Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 on the grounds of it being violative of the fundamental right to privacy. A five-judge constitution bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice AK Sikri, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan reserved the verdict on 10 May after hearing the petitions for over 38 days starting 17 January. The bench was informed by Attorney General K K Venugopal that this has become the ""second longest"" case in terms of days of hearing after the historic Kesavananda Bharati case of 1973. The Kesavananda Bharati case, which was heard by a 13-judge bench, by a majority of 7:6 had propounded the doctrine of 'Basic Structure and of the Constitution' had held that the amendments which may affect this structure were subject to judicial review. Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium advanced the rejoinder submissions and said Aadhaar was not an ""affirmative action"" on the part of state to serve the people. ""Is the Act an enabler or is it in the guise of an enabler? The Act is not an instrumentality to deliver services. It is only a means of identification,"" he said. ""We have to read the true purpose of the law and whether the law seeks to achieve that purpose. Dignity and autonomy is not preserved by section 7 of the Aadhaar Act,"" he said. Aadhaar Act did not have a proper purpose and ""a claim to a proper purpose is not proper purpose"", he said, adding that ""Authentication is at the heart of the Act. Failure of authentication is a ground for denial of services."" The State seeks to take away the data without the backing of a strong data protection framework, he argued. To this, the bench said the Act like Aadhaar needed a regulator which was presently absent. The senior lawyer said private players have been allowed in the Act to have the access to Aadhaar data and moreover, there was no regime of protection. Senior advocate Arvind Datar said the government did not need to arrest or detain a citizen as it can simply ""switch off"" a person. ""Under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Aadhaar is not just confined to banks but has gone beyond it's scope. Aadhaar is needed for mutual funds, insurance policies and credit cards as well, among other things. ""Only magic words like black money, national security and terrorism are being thrown around by the State. The justification of a law for proportionality cannot be a ritualistic exercise,"" Datar said. A battery of senior lawyers, including Shyam Divan, Gopal Subramanium, Kapil Sibal, P Chidambaram, Arvind Datar, K V Vishwanath, Anand Grover, Sajan Poovayya and a few others, argued on behalf of petitioners opposing the Aadhaar Scheme on various grounds. Besides the former HC judge, the top lawyers argued for petitioners, who included Magsaysay awardee Shanta Sinha, feminist researcher Kalyani Sen Menon, social activists Aruna Roy, Nikhil De, Nachiket Udupa and CPI leader Binoy Visman. A key argument against the Aadhaar scheme was that it was violative of the nine-judge bench verdict that had held that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution. The Centre and the Unique Identificaiton Authority of India (UIDAI), the governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the RBI had argued in favour of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits And Services) Act, 2016 and were represented by the Attorney General, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Jayant Bhushan and lawyer Zoheb Hossain. During the arguments, the Centre had strongly defended its decision to seed Aadhaar numbers with mobile phones, telling the top court that it could have been hauled up for contempt if the verification of mobile users was not undertaken by it. However, the court had said that the government had misinterpreted its order and used it as a ""tool"" to make Aadhaar mandatory for mobile users. The court had also not agreed  with the government's contention that the Aadhaar law was correctly termed as a Money Bill by the Lok Sabha Speaker as it dealt with ""targeted delivery of subsidies"" for which funds came from the Consolidated Fund of India. Divan, who had opened the arguments on behalf of the opponents, had termed Aadhaar as ""an electronic leash"" and said that the government could completely destroy an individual by ""switching off"" the 12-digit unique identifier number. On the other hand, the Centre had said that the law was valid and allowed minimal invasion to ensure the right to life of millions of Indians by ensuring seamless delivery of subsidies, benefits and services to the poorest of poor.

PTI,"The armed forces are a splendid embodiment of the country’s “secular project” and it is vitally important that they remain ""uncontaminated"" from any sectarian appeal, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday, 25 September. The senior Congress leader also said the judiciary should not lose sight of its primary duty to protect the secular spirit of the Constitution, as the task has become much more demanding with political disputes and electoral battles turning out to be increasingly over-laced with religious overtones and prejudices. “The judiciary needs to arrive at its own enlightened view of its custodianship of the Constitution-irrespective of the irresponsible and selfish politicians who have no qualms in injecting communal virus in our body politic,” he said, while delivering the second AB Bardhan memorial lecture. Talking about the importance of the Election Commission in India’s democratic framework, Singh said it must ensure that religion, religious sentiments and prejudices do not get worked into election discourse. “As the custodian of the integrity of the electoral process, it is incumbent upon the Election Commission to see to it that religion and religious sentiments and prejudices do not get worked into the election discourse,” he said. ""The Commission must be thinking of rolling back the easy acceptance of over-manipulation of religious imagery,"" the senior Congress leader said. Singh hailed the armed forces, saying that they were a splendid embodiment of India's secular project and have a glorious record of keeping away from the ""politicians' manipulations and intrigues"". Singh's remarks came amid the government's plans to celebrate on 29 September, the second anniversary of the surgical strikes on terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The Congress has been accusing the Modi government of politicising the armed forces for electoral gains. Terming the demolition of the Babri Masjid as a ""traumatic event"" that brought India's secular commitments into ""disrepute"", Singh noted that the entire political leadership came in for criticism for failing to protect a place of worship. ""In particular, concerned citizens were deeply disappointed at the judiciary's stance in the events leading up to the demolition. 6 December, 1992, was a sad day for our secular republic,"" the former prime minister said. He also forcefully stated that any attempt to weaken the secular fabric of India, would be an attempt to dismantle the larger egalitarian project – a secular, progressive and democratic polity. He said the onus of preserving the country's secular robustness, rests on all constitutional institutions. Singh said the media is an equal partner in upholding secularism. In his address, Singh also recalled the famous Bomai case in which a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court found an opportunity to reaffirm that secularism was a basic feature of the Constitution. He said it came as a ""consolation"", but satisfaction derived from the verdict was short-lived, as soon after that came Justice JS Verma's ""famous and controversial"" 'Hindutva a way of life' judgment. ""The judgment ended up making our political discourse somewhat lopsided; and, many believe that 'there can be no doubt that the decision requires to be revisited,"" he said. Singh asserted that no constitutional arrangement can be protected and preserved only by the judiciary, no matter how vigilant or enlightened the judges may be. ""Ultimately, it comes down to the political leadership, civil society, religious leaders, and intelligentsia to defend the Constitution and its secular commitments,"" he said. In his address, Singh also listed various articles of the Constitution that uphold its secular spirit. ""Every civilized society is known and defined by the terms it offers to its minorities, especially its religious minorities. And that was one of the principal issues facing our national leaders when they got down to writing a Constitution for the newly-Independent India,"" Singh said. He also highlighted that there was a definite global and domestic context to the Constitution-writing exercise. ""This ideology, of National Socialism in Germany, was a violent assertion of one race over another; in practice, it took pride in a naked use of aggression against minorities in Germany,"" he said. Singh also stressed on the role played by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders of the independence movement such as Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, in upholding secular values.

Reham Khan,"Pakistan’s newly-formed Imran Khan government is barely a month old, but it has kept analysts busy and the audience entertained with its daily acrobatics. After the refusal to live in the Prime Minister’s House, promises of cheaper-than-Uber helicopter rides, the boot sale of rusty old cars and buffaloes, one would think Imran’s government would be out of ideas. Cheese-making is perhaps as old as politics itself and an equally complex process, but the relationship and the influence of cheese on politics might come as somewhat of a surprise to you. From the giant wheels of cheese delivered to American presidents, to Charles de Gaulle blaming cheese for problems in governance, it is a fascinating shared history. We are told that France, with its 1,200 odd varieties of cheese, is the second-most unstable country in the European Union. Luxembourg pays less attention to cheese production. Cheese tastes may vary, from those like myself who prefer smelly Camembert to the current Prime Minister of Pakistan who loves his mild, nutty Swiss Emmental – but we all love cheese. America’s founding father, and even the third president of the United States Thomas Jefferson, fell in love with Mac ‘N’ Cheese and first brought it to America from France. Of course Imran is clearly nothing like Jefferson who was a proponent of democracy and individual rights. Most election campaigns bring with it promises and language so cheesy that could give serious competition to Bollywood heroes. The   has a gift of churning out promises like no other. From the campaign songs serenading the ‘great leader’ to the thousands of social media posts reinforcing his demigod status, to mainstream commentators describing him as the 'last hope' – it has always been a cheesy tale. However, within days of ‘Naya Pakistan’, Imran’s followers were beginning to notice that there was no sign of ‘breaking the mould’ of Purana Pakistan. Back in 2013, Imran vowed to clear up corruption in 90 days but later dissolved the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab Commission he had himself set up. In the run-up to the elections this time, the  promised   in 100 days. This time in the election slogans, Imran Khan’s party PTI, promised to take emergency measures to make agriculture profitable for farmers, even offering financial help. But once they came to power, they immediately hiked up fertilizer prices. A quick browse reveals that both Urea & DAP are mainly produced by Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited. Back in April 2013, Pakistan's top antitrust watchdog slapped a maximum collective penalty of Rs 8.6 billion on Fauji Fertilizer and Engro Fertilizers – the two largest urea manufacturers in the country – after both were found involved in the “excessive pricing of urea”. The current Finance Minister Asad Umar was head of Engro at the time of the price increase back then. I was getting quite paranoid that this ban on cheese was a conspiracy to keep me away from  . I also suspected that the British government was with Imran too since post-Brexit specialty cheese will be hard to find and certainly more expensive in Britain according to an LSE study. As I looked into the so-called ‘saving’ the new PM was proposing, it amounted to a measly 0.01 percent of the current deficit of £13.5 billion. Then why this unfair ban? So while restaurant menus may suffer and the Tabdeeli burgers may have to give up their imported cheese slices, a few will be grinning like Cheshire cats. For the politicians who think the game might be over for them because the  seems to be assured a smooth innings with the umpires firmly on his side, let's be reminded that David carried cheese to his troops just before slaying Goliath. The Opposition just got tougher with the former PM Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam, who are now out of Adiala jail.

Speaking to  , Chakravarty said that his own specific role will be to oversee the Congress party’s communication to party workers and to the voters through the Shakti platform, and that Gautam will be in charge of implementing that at the ground level. The platform is a phone-based pilot project to establish direct contact between party workers, supporters and the central leadership, he said. Congress will be using data analytics, high-end technology, and artificial intelligence and machine learning to establish this communication, Chakravarty added. While Chakravarty said that he does not want to compare the strategies of Congress and the BJP, he asserted that his party aims to use technology to communicate in a meaningful manner. Chakravarty added that the Congress party was “keen to attract” educated people and professionals into mainstream politics, and that his department provides an entry-point to many such people.

Arun Dev,"In the first week of March, around 50,000 farmers marched a distance of 180km from Nashik to Mumbai to gherao the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha. The massive rally is considered to be an iconic political movement the country saw this year. Forty-four-year-old Vijoo Krishnan, Joint Secretary of All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), is credited with inspiring the farmers for this historic march. Too busy to read? Listen to the story instead: For Vijoo, his days as the students’ union president in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), from 1998 to 1999 played a huge role in shaping his political career and organising the march. Before becoming a full-time activist, his first job as a lecturer had taken him to Bengaluru’s St Joseph’s College in 2005. Here, he was in for a cultural shock. “‘  and  were slogans that shaped our future in JNU. But my students didn’t have student unions,” Vijoo recollected. Even during 2013, when the student politics, especially that in JNU, was shaping nation’s political discourse, politics was kept out of the classrooms in Karnataka. In fact, between 2001 and 2016, there were no student representatives in Bangalore University’s academic council, which made the policies for students. In 2016, when students were allowed in the academic council, there were only five students in a council of 54 members. So why has Karnataka, which has produced several influential political leaders, including a prime minister, shied away from student politics? The answer lies in the violent political history of the state in the 1980s. B Somashekar, former higher education minister of Karnataka, was among those who vehemently opposed student union elections in the state. “It is still a matter of pride for me that I was the first student union president of Mysuru unversity, from a scheduled caste. I worked hard as a student leader and reached that position in 1974. But on the union’s inaugural day, I was beaten up by upper caste student leaders who didn’t want me as the president,” Somashekar told  . In 1996, when he became the higher education minister under the JD(U) government, he says he was reminded of his scars. “By then, student politics (union elections) was banned by the government, but elections continued using loopholes in the law. Then, I changed the rules of universities, and union elections were ended for good,” he added. When asked why someone who has been a student leader would turn against politics in campus, he said the caste-based violence had “destroyed the ideals of the student politics”. Several leaders in Karnataka politics like DK Shivakumar, BK Hariprasad, Shobha Karndlaje and Roshan Baig owe their political careers to their days as student leaders in the 1970s and the 1980s. The student unions in Karnataka had strong influence over the university’s policies during those years. Student agitations against fee hikes and other university policies were common and effective. But the student political parties were affiliated to the major political ones. This ensured that conflict between parties resulted in spats in college campuses. A retired faculty member from government arts and science college in Bengaluru, on the condition of anonymity, told  that one time, a violent protest broke out in the campus over some statement made two politicians. “I don’t recall the particulars, but a Congress leader had made a statement against a Janata party leader. Soon, some slogans were raised, and then there were clashes,” he said. As the union elections had become an extension of the electoral politics, the parties started pumping money and muscle into the campus, and soon, campus politics became violent, “I have witnessed elements of the underworld entering the college, on behalf of the ruling party, to attack candidates ahead of the elections. It was not like violence took place often and in every college, but there were enough incidents to make case against campus politics,” added the professor. Although the government banned student wings of major political parties from contesting campus elections in 1989, the union elections didn’t stop in several colleges. After students protested demanding elections, the syndicate system was introduced. A syndicate consisted of a group of students contesting for the various posts in the students’ union. On paper, these syndicates were not affiliated to any party. On the ground, however, the reality was different, remembers Prakash, who was part of the SFI while studying in Bengaluru University. “Syndicates were formed by the student wings of political parties, and once again, the issues concerning students were overshadowed by electoral politics. While the Left was not strong in the campuses, members of the other three parties continued to clash over the elections,” he said. According to him, the efforts of those who campaigned to retain the student elections, at least in the form of syndicates, were ruined by the occasional incidents of violence. “They (university authorities) were looking for a reason to shut down the syndicate system as well. Citing some incidents of violence, it was eventually ended by 1997,” said Prakash, who is now part of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). , during its research, learnt that even though there was opposition in the campuses against the government order in 1989 banning student union election and the complete shutdown in the late 90s, they were not contested in the court at any point. The efforts to bring back campus politics back is strongly opposed by many. Those in favour lack the political will. N Prabhudev, former vice chancellor of Bangalore University, said politics will be a distraction for students. “Bringing back politics to classrooms will bring back the violence as well. Students will lose their focus on studies, so we have strongly opposed anytime a proposal has been made to bring back student union elections,” he said. Higher education ministers from all three major parties, during the last decade, have refused to bring back student union elections. Even those who support the idea of bringing politics back to campuses have not taken a strong stand. Roshan Baig, MLA and a former minister in the Congress government, said he would support to bring back the student politics “if there are any campaigns”, but didn’t comment on starting a campaign for the same.

Arun Dev,"For the past two months, an ego clash between two senior Congress ministers has been threatening the stability of coalition government in the state. Ramesh Jarkiholi, the Minister for Municipal Administration and his brother, Satish, had threatened to rebel, if the Minister for Irrigation DK Shivakumar continued to interfere in the local politics of Belagavi – the stronghold of the Jarkiholis. Too buys to read? Listen to the story instead But a press conference by the BJP, accusing the Congress party of money laundering, managed to achieve what senior Congress leaders couldn’t – getting the two warring Congress leaders to face each other. On Wednesday night, hours after the BJP accused DK Shivakumar of money laundering, Ramesh paid him a surprise visit at Bengaluru’s Apollo hospital, where DKS was undergoing treatment for food poisoning. According to sources, Ramesh extended his support to DK Shivakumar to take on the BJP. Even on Thursday morning, Ramesh visited DKS in the hospital. Hours later, in New Delhi, Satish Jarkiholi said that all the “problems were settled”. On Wednesday, hours before Ramesh paid a friendly visit to DK Shivakumar in the hospital, Satish was in talks with the Congress leadership in New Delhi. According to sources, Satish was adamant about keeping DK Shivakumar, a leader from South Karnataka, out of North Karnataka’s local politics. According to sources, the candidate proposed by the Jarkiholi brothers was B Nagendra, a legislator from Ballari. The cabinet expansion is expected to take place after the by-elections to three Legislative Council seats from the Legislative Assembly constituency. The Jarkiholi brothers are getting what they have asked for – removing DK Shivakumar from North Karnataka and strengthening their control over their region. The Jarkiholi brothers belong to a scheduled caste community – Valmikies, which is a big vote bank in the region, and their candidate to the cabinet, B Nagendra belongs to the Valmiki community. This further strengthens their position in the region. But Nagendra is new to Congress. He left the BJP for Congress before the 2018 assembly election. Ballari region has other senior leaders who have been loyal to the Congress. For example, MLA E Tukaram, who was the only candidate from the Congress who won in the 2008 Assembly elections, when the BJP swept the votes in the region. While the clash between Jarkiholi brothers and DK Shivakumar has come to an end, the BJP is still fishing in troubled waters. But end of the day, Congress can breathe easy as the biggest hurdle of brokering piece between two powerhouses in the party has been overcome. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"American historian and lecturer on media and consumer culture, Stuart Ewen, said: “The history of PR is a history of a battle for what is reality and how people will see and understand reality.” Having lived a shadowy existence for most of its 92 years, partly of their own volition and episodically because of the actions of their supporters, leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would like to believe that their problems have been compounded by the inability to communicate the true intent and purpose of their organisation. Mohan Bhagwat's three-day lecture series must be seen in this context, and seems to be a ploy to increase the RSS’s social acceptability. The organisation which has been banned three times in independent India for unlawful activity, including on charges of involvement in the assassination of Gandhi, has been running quasi-study circles annually for its cadre. Reflecting the RSS' early fascination with militarist symbolism, its founders called these Officers' Training Camps. This programme came under the spotlight in June when former President Pranab Mukherjee delivered the valedictory address in Nagpur at the conclusion of this year's OTC, now rechristened as ‘Sangh Sikhsha Varg’ or ‘RSS Education Camp’. The curricula at these camps are three-tiered: the first year or Prathamik Shiksha Varg is a seven-day long affair and held at district levels. Swayamsevaks, depending on their grasp of the ideology, issues and rituals, then graduate to the second and third year camps, the last of which is held only in Nagpur and just for the crème de la crème, who qualify to become   or preachers of the RSS. In Hindi, adolescence is termed   and the prefix would be fitting for this televised lecture series because it targets political adolescents – people who are either   with the RSS but are in search of argumentative ammunition to first convince themselves and then others in their socio-professional circles – or are marking their presence to  by the powers that be. But this has not been the case and it was, at least in the first two days, planned as a ‘ ’ event. Thus, this one-sided discourse has turned out to be an exercise in marketing. Bhagwat's first two lectures were exercises in presenting ‘partial truths’. In content, his speeches contained little but uni-dimensional fundamentals of the RSS, and could have been presented by anyone in the Sangh Parivar. Many of his claims were aimed at stripping the RSS of its ‘political pariah’ status, and to contest the  and   tags pinned on its khaki shorts. Bhagwat however, should know that events since May 2014 demonstrate that the RSS is now known   for assertions made with a smile and flourish inside the privileged portals of Vigyan Bhawan, a symbol of post-colonial grandeur. Instead, the RSS is now known by outsiders – by the actions of street warriors who have either attended the Sangh Siksha Vargs or are guided by the public discourse that goes around in the name of Hindutva. For them, the rule of law and the Indian democracy's ‘only holy book’, namely, the Constitution, are obstacles to their national-rebuilding endeavour. On the first evening, Bhagwat elaborated on how Keshav Baliram Hedgewar went about establishing the RSS. He narrated several stories, some restrained and others exaggerated, on how Hedgewar too had been a part of the Congress and the early phase of the national movement. Bhagwat even regaled with great pride that Hedgewar went to jail for violating the law, and put up his own defence in court which the judge considered was more seditious than the actual  . First, he did not detail that the RSS founder Hedgewar moved away from the Congress and the Gandhian narrative because of the incorporation of the Khilafat movement in the Non-Cooperation Movement. Bhagwat also did not mention how Hedgewar, along with other Hindu nationalists, reacted provocatively after the Moplah Uprising. Bhagwat also offered no explanation as to why Hedgewar viewed the incidents from a communal perspective and depicted the rebellion as ‘the biggest Muslim attack on the Hindus after Muslim rule’. The RSS leader certainly made no mention of how Hedgewar was involved in providing   to Hindus during their religious procession in which loud music was being played on thoroughfares where Muslim colonies were located. Furthermore, no mention was made of the RSS activists acting as early vigilante groups in September 1927 and spreading out in Hindu colonies to provide   when riots broke out, following the assassination of the revered Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand. Secondly, Bhagwat also made no mention of the influence of V D Savarkar and his seminal text,   on Hedgewar, and how it inspired him to form the RSS. Despite continuing   about Savarkar's space in the development of Hindu nationalistic thought, most leaders eulogise the leader who was jailed for his alleged involvement in Gandhi's assassination. It must be recalled that immediately a day after being sworn-in as prime minister, Narendra Modi paid obeisance to Savarkar on his birth anniversary by making floral offerings at his portrait, contentiously installed in the Central Hall of Parliament during the Vajpayee regime. While making sweeping statements in praise of the Congress for its role in the freedom struggle, affirming loyalty to the Indian Constitution and saying that Hindutva does not believe in purging Muslims, Bhagwat does not enter the fundamental question of what separates the Sangh Parivar from its ideological opponents – its notion of the nation, and nationhood. The RSS’s self-definition is fundamentally different from that of others and this is the basic divide. Bhagwat did not throw open this debate and instead provided his perspective while leaving the field open for followers (from what has now become a Hindutva rainbow), to practise and impose   of Hindutva. Looks like Bhagwat is going by the Byzantine maxim reworded by the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis: “Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.”       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

AP,"The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Thursday, 27 September for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who says he sexually assaulted her as a teenager, agreeing to a date and time after nearly a week of uncertainty over whether Ford would appear at all. The agreement sets the stage for a dramatic showdown as Kavanaugh and Ford each tell their side of the story. It will also determine the fate of Kavanaugh's confirmation, which hangs on the votes of a handful of senators. It had seemed assured before Ford, now a 51-year-old California college professor, went public a week ago with her allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party when they were in high school. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrangled with Ford's lawyers for the last week over the exact terms of her appearance. She made several requests, some of which were accommodated — a Thursday hearing, three days later than originally scheduled, and a smaller hearing room with less press access to avoid a media circus, for example. Grassley's staff also agreed to let Ford testify without Kavanaugh in the room, for there to be only one camera in the room, ""adequate"" breaks and a high security presence. ""As with any witness who comes before the Senate, the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot hand over its constitutional duties to attorneys for outside witnesses,"" Mike Davis, Grassley's top nominations counsel, wrote in an email exchange with Ford's lawyers obtained by The Associated Press. Ford's lawyers said it was still unclear who will ask questions, as Republicans were trying to hire an outside female counsel who could take over the questioning. The 11 senators on the GOP side of the dais are all men, which could send an unwanted message on live television against the backdrop of the #MeToo era. They could also use Republican staff attorneys on the committee. Democratic senators were expected to ask their own questions. ""We were told no decision has been made on this important issue, even though various senators have been dismissive of her account and should have to shoulder their responsibility to ask her questions,"" the attorneys for Ford said in a statement. Earlier Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said lawyers for Ford were contesting two GOP conditions — that Ford and Kavanaugh would be the only witnesses and that an independent counsel would ask the questions. ""If they continue to contest those two things, there won't be a hearing,"" Graham said. Graham, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" promised a fair hearing in which both Ford and Kavanaugh ""will be challenged"" but said ""unless there's something more"" to back up her accusation, he indicated he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Graham said he's ""not going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life over this."" One issue that appeared to have been resolved in Sunday's hourlong phone call between Judiciary staff and Ford's lawyers was the committee's refusal to subpoena Mark Judge, the other person Ford alleges was in the room when the assault occurred. Judge has told the committee he does not recall the incident. The lawyers for Ford want the committee to hear from other witnesses, including a person who conducted a polygraph of Ford earlier this year, the person familiar with the talks said. Ford's lawyers also want to call on two trauma experts, the person said. Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat on the committee, said on Sunday he believed Ford's requests have been reasonable and that she deserves a fair hearing to determine whether her allegations are serious enough to vote down Kavanaugh's nomination. Durbin acknowledged that lawmakers will ""probably not"" be able to know the truth of Ford's decades-old accusation. But Durbin left little doubt that that Democrats will go after Kavanaugh's drinking history to help shed light on the matter. Ford has alleged Kavanaugh was ""stumbling drunk"" when it happened. Durbin told ABC's ""This Week"" that some Republicans ""reached out to Democratic senators and assured them that they are looking to this as kind of a determination as to how their final vote"" on Kavanaugh is cast. Democrats again called for the FBI to investigate Ford's claims, a request that was unlikely to be met as President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have said it's unnecessary. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, sent a letter to Trump on Sunday saying the FBI has more than enough time to investigate before Ford and Kavanaugh testify on Thursday. Republicans viewed the demands for an investigation, and Ford's various requests, as a way to delay voting on Trump's nominee. They have also cast some doubt on Ford's allegations, with the Judiciary panel announcing that it had investigated the incident and talked to three other people who Ford has told The Washington Post were at the party — Judge, Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser. The Post reported on Sunday that Keyser said in a brief interview at her home that she still believes Ford, even if she doesn't remember the party. The White House is approaching Ford's potential testimony with trepidation, nervous that an emotional performance might not just damage Kavanaugh's chances but could further energize female voters to turn out against Republicans in November. Moreover, the West Wing aides who had urged Trump to remain muted in his response to the accusations worried about how the president might react to an hourslong, televised hearing. Trump mused to confidants that the ""fake"" attacks against his nominee were meant to undermine his presidency, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

AP,"The Election Commission of Maldives on Monday, 24 September, announced that Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih has won the Presidential Elections with 134,616 votes. Solih is a member of the Maldivian Democratic Party. Solih, a long-time but little-known lawmaker, declared victory on 23 September, at his party’s campaign headquarters in the capital city Male in a contentious election widely seen as a referendum on the island nation’s young democracy. Supporters draped in the Maldives' flag took to the streets, hugging one another, cheering and honking horns to celebrate Solih's unexpected win. Solih had 58.3 percent of the vote, with nearly 92 percent of ballots counted just after midnight Monday, according to independent newspaper website mihaaru.com. Election watchdog Transparency Maldives tweeted that Solih had won “by a decisive margin.” Yameen's campaign had not conceded the race, and no one from the campaign could be immediately reached for comment. The opposition had feared the election would be rigged in favor of strongman President Yameen Abdul Gayoom, whose first term was marked by a crackdown on political rivals, courts and the media. In a victory speech, Solih called the election results “a moment of happiness, hope and history,” adding that he did not think the election process had been transparent. A police raid on Solih's main campaign office the night before the election was seen by the opposition as a worrying sign that Yameen would ""muzzle his way"" to re-election, according to Hamid Abdul Gafoor, an opposition spokesman and former Maldives lawmaker now based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. But Yameen's critics, including Solih, say he has systematically rolled back democratic freedoms. Few foreign media organizations were allowed in to cover the election and there had been warnings that the Maldives was slipping back to autocratic rule, just a decade after achieving democracy. In February, Yameen declared  , suspended the constitution and ordered troops to storm the Supreme Court and arrest judges and other rivals to stave off impeachment. The European Union had said that it was not sending election observers because the Maldives had failed to meet the basic conditions for monitoring. The US had threatened to sanction Maldivian officials if the elections were not free and fair. Opposition supporters in the Maldives and in neighbouring Sri Lanka, where former President Mohamed Nasheed lives in exile, decried Saturday’s raid as a naked attempt to rig the vote in favour of Yameen. More than 2,60,000 of the Maldives' 4,00,000 people were eligible to vote at about 400 polling stations across the approximately 1,200 islands that comprise the Indian Ocean archipelago. Voters also stood in long lines in Malaysia, the UK, India and Sri Lanka, where the opposition had encouraged overseas Maldivians to participate. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Former French President Francois Hollande caused a huge stir this week with his statement on the Indo-French Rafale deal. Hollande, who was the president of France when the Modi government hatched a fresh deal on the Rafale deal, said Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence was recommended by the Indian government. The French government, Hollande said, had no say in the matter. The Rafale deal has been the Modi government’s Achilles heel, especially over the past year or so, with the Opposition raising questions on the process behind changing the 126-fighter jet deal at the last moment. Questions were especially raised on the decision to drop Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as offset partner from the deal and replace it with Reliance Defence, which had little experience in defence manufacturing. The deal was also rectified from that of 126 jets to just 36, which the government claimed they were purchasing in “fly-away” condition for the same price. Hollande’s statement, therefore, has seemingly validated the Opposition’s claims of “crony capitalism” by the BJP, and has also exposed the BJP’s shifting goalposts when it came to the matter. After Modi’s Paris announcement on 10 April 10 2015, where the change in the deal was announced, the government stated that the step was needed to be taken because the UPA couldn’t negotiate between French company Dassault Aviation and HAL. On November 18 2017, Defence Minister Nirmal Sitharaman said: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley added to that by saying it was a “government-to-government transaction”and the procedure for the new deal was “different”. According to a report by  , however, just 15 days before the Paris announcement, Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier said in a press conference that contract negotiations with India on the 126-aircraft deal was 95 percent completed. Then what was this “delay” that the Indian government is talking about? What also caught public eye was that the deal of roughly 7.8 billion Euros that the UPA had hatched for 126 jets remained the same even for 36 jets. Defending this, Sitharaman said: Additionally, she said: However, recently, the government has shifted gears from just blaming the UPA to also blaming the “poor state of affairs” at HAL, which is a PSU and falls under the defence ministry. Questioning HAL’s capability, Sitharaman had said former Defence Minister AK Antony had pulled HAL out of the deal as negotiations between the firm and Dassault couldn’t be made during his tenure; a statement opposed vehemently by the Congress. Sitharaman’s statement was also opposed by HAL’s former boss, T Suvarna Raju. Furthermore, according to The Wire’s report, a month before the change in the deal was announced by Modi in April 2015, Dassault CEO Trappier presented his company’s 2014 annual report which stated, “the continuation of exclusive negotiations with the Indian authorities and Indian industrial partners to finalise the contract for the sale / licensing of 126 RAFALE”. In other words, as per the report, Dassault’s own document shows that, as on 10 March 2015, negotiations between Dassault Aviation and the Government of India/HAL had not failed as Nirmala Sitharaman claims. All in all, less than a month before Modi’s Paris announcement, Dassault Aviation’s CEO claimed 95 percent work of the 126-aircraft deal was over, that it had signed a work-share agreement with HAL. However, now, the BJP maintains that it is because of various inefficiencies and high cost associated with a HAL-Dassault co-production that Dassault was forced to choose a company with almost no experience in aviation manufacturing.

Syed Ata Hasnain,"In the 28 year-long proxy conflict in J&K, the initiative in innovations has been almost equal, between the proxy elements and the Indian Security Forces (SF). At the outset in 1989-90, the SF were smothered by the sheer tempo of the uprising. The re-deployment of the Rashtriya Rifles (RR), from its original operational areas in Punjab also happened rapidly as soon as the gravity of the threat in the Valley was realised. A fine decision, as has been borne out by the performance of the RR as the veritable saviour of the Valley. In 1999, the Pakistani deep state guided the terrorists' change in strategy, bringing suicide attacks to the fore through the so-called fedayeen. Suffering initial setbacks and casualties, the SF tightened security and did not permit a defensive mindset. Resorting to street turbulence in 2008 was the next ploy, followed by flash mob demonstrations at encounter sites in 2015; both have been neutralised through patience, calibration and innovation, although they are constant irritants. With greater local colour in militancy, the unsaid convention of   targeting local SF soldiers and policemen appears to have been shelved by the terror groups. Local servicemen along with their families have lived through years of militancy without too much harm. An odd incident, reprisal or revenge-targeting has occurred in the past. First, to counter the psychological operations of the SF which project the keenness of local youth to join the mainstream. Secondly, to de-moralise the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP) in particular, so that it ceases to be the force multiplier which it has been for many years. The threats held out by the Hizbul Mujahideen to the local SF personnel to resign and make online statements of the same, are apparently now under execution with the abduction and killing of three SPOs. Fake news is also being generated, projecting the resignation of SPOs to cause confusion, dismay and loss of control. Under the prevailing circumstances, the JKP leadership has not done badly thus far in keeping its flock intact, but that integrity could see a meltdown any day, recovery from which would be a monumental task. Thus, innovative counters have to be evolved. Long term strategies are easy and would involve enhanced accommodations for police families, to enable them to live in a secure environment. Yet, that itself goes against the concept of policing. Police forces live as units and sub-units in limited numbers. Mostly they function from police stations and live among the people, in private homes. That makes them and their families vulnerable. In case of soldiers, it is the Territorial Army Home & Hearth (TA-H&H) personnel, on-leave regulars and their families who are vulnerable. Official government accommodation with protection is only part-solution and would anyway give the proxies a sense of achievement. It should not be attempted for now but with more effective training, clubbing their deployment and motivation, they could be safer with weapons in the future. Second, the most affected zone is the Shopian-Kulgam belt, its immediate north and south. Re-deployment even if temporary, may be done to create more points of SF presence. The answer lies in limiting the freedom of movement of terrorists which clearly demands more troops in the affected zones. These troops need to adopt domination tactics through 24x7 patrolling and check points along all arteries. Movement control measures have to be professionally implemented without causing too much inconvenience to the general population. All measures for better inflow of human intelligence must be undertaken. Any attempt to cow down smaller and more numerous SF deployments through agitational tactics must lead to arrests and deporting these elements from the Valley. However, it needs to be realised that extraordinary situations need early arrest of trends before they have a delusional effect. The Shopian-Kulgam belt had a very strong Army presence in 1999-2001 when militancy was at its peak. This deployment was scaled down to reinforce the LoC and counter-infiltration grid. The terrorist mentors have been smart as they know raising a security alarm at the internal grid will result in the dilution of deployment at the LoC and open infiltration avenues. Thus, re-deployment from the LoC is not an option. With local body polls in the offing, additional police forces will anyway be inducted. Inducting a few Army units specifically for South Kashmir will do no harm. It is political leadership at the lower level that throws up such social movements. The mainstream parties can play a role but will be reluctant to do so as their boycott of the polls is causing confusion. However, the Governor's advisors should test their own capability to influence minds with social media. Lastly, despair is what the deep state across the LoC desires. However, recalling the number of times such situations have arisen and been overcome will do the nation some good. That is the message the nation needs to be given, especially on social media.           (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Rana Safvi,"In the context of Muharram, almost everyone knows who Husain is, but not many know the name of Zainab, or the fact that had it not been for her, Husain wouldn’t have been known. Without Zainab’s speeches and sermons, Husain would have been dismissed as a mere rebel fighting against the ruler of the time. Husain, his male relatives and companions had been martyred in Karbala, Iraq on the 10th Muharram in 61 Hijri /680 AD. Husain’s war over evil was over, and he went to heaven victorious. Now it was his sister Zainab’s war to fight, and   was not a ten-day war but a prolonged one. Zainab was destined to triumph and become a feminist icon for generations of men and women to come. On the 11th Muharram, the women, children and Husain’s son Zain-ul Abidin were captured by Yezid’s victorious army and taken to the court of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, Governor of Kufa. Kufa was the city where Zainab had lived with her father and siblings. This was the city where her father Ali had been the Caliph and his daughters, the princesses. This was the city where Zainab and her sister Umme Kulsum held classes for the women to teach them the exegesis of the Quran and Hadith of her grandfather. It was here that they were brought as captives on unsaddled camels, unveiled, disheveled and in a state of extreme sorrow. As the caravan entered the city of Kufa and the hordes of spectators came to gawk at what they thought were the family of the slain rebels, Zainab gave her first sermon. There was a tumult in the city and some one asked, “Who are they?” Zainab identified her caravan as the descendants of the Holy Prophet, and because her voice could not be heard over the noise, she urged them to be quiet. The spectators were left breathless as the daughter of Ali spoke in the same tone and tenor as her father. The following day, the prisoners from the Prophet’s family were produced in court. The Governor ibn Ziyad did not recognize Zainab in her disheveled (yet confident) state, and asked her to identify herself. She drew herself up and said, “I am Zainab bint Ali.” When ibn Ziyad mocked her for being in the state she was in, she said quietly and firmly that it was he who had been disgraced for his evil actions and he would find out soon enough. She was blessed to be the daughter of Ali and the granddaughter of the Prophet, and to be the sister of Husain who had attained martyrdom in the way of Allah. It was a cruel winter when Zainab and the other captives began the difficult 750-mile journey to Damascus. They had to take the longer and less frequented route for fear of rebellion, as stories of Yezid’s actions against the Prophet’s grandson and family were beginning to percolate to Iraq. It fell to Zainab, Umme Kulsum and Zain-ul Abidin to bury the children who died on this arduous journey and comfort the grieving mothers. Wherever a crowd gathered along the way, Zainab, Zain-ul Abidin, Umme Kulsum and Fatima Kubra (daughter of Husain) gave fiery speeches, informing the people of their lineage, of Husain’s fight, and the trials they had to undergo. When they reached the outskirts of Damascus, they were ordered to wait for 72 hours in the main square of the souq (market) just outside the Grand Mosque while the court was being decorated to receive them. Zainab once again addressed the people who had gathered to gape at them, on Husain’s fight and sacrifice, so that the rejoicing crowd would know that it was not a rebel’s defeat that they were celebrating. Throughout the long journey, Zainab and the other captives had to bear the pain of seeing the severed heads of their slain relatives carried on spears by Yezid's army. This was the norm of the victorious armies of the day. Even in the court of Yezid, Hussain’s head lay before them. As the captives tied with a rope were led into the grand mosque towards the wooden balcony on which Yezid sat on a bejeweled throne, Zainab seemed to imbibe divine energy. The captives were herded together on a small platform in front of the throne. Yezid recited a couplet in praise of his victory and mocked Zainab and Zain-ul Abidin. The captives were quickly moved to a ruined house where they were kept imprisoned for around a year. Zainab was once again the pillar of strength for the women and children, and her nephew. Amidst murmurs of dissent and disapproval, Yezid offered release to Zain-ul Abidin. He consulted his aunt as usual. Zainab asked that the heads of their martyred relatives be returned to them and a house be given to them where they could mourn their dead. She had returned to Medina altered, her hair white and her back bent, but determined to let the world know of her brother’s sacrifice. The real victory of Zainab the ‘Lion Heart’ lies in the fact that she ensured that her brother’s sacrifice is remembered even today and that Islam, as brought to us by the Prophet, was not altered or tampered with by Yezid.

Shadab Moizee,"Sandeep Suman At the RSS' 3-day conclave, RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's words sounded as sweet as honey. He drifted from the set format and attempted to remove barriers. Let's listen to an excerpt from his speech first. Very well said. If the RSS walks the talk, the entire nation will applaud. But the dedication with which these words were said and the timing of the speech raises some doubts too. There are several questions that arise in the mind of an Indian Muslim. The answers to which must be given from similar platforms. The answers must be given in detail, but it does not happen. The very first question is of loyalty which we are asked to prove every day. If a Muslim appreciates Nusrat Fateh-Ali Khan's music, is a fan of Shahid Afridi, congratulates Imran Khan on Twitter on being elected the new Pakistan prime minister or even wears a green T-shirt, then why does he have to hear, ""Look he's showing his true colours. He is a Pakistani?"" And why is that? We are humans too. We have our likes and dislikes. I can be fond of the Eiffel Tower. I can be a fan of Mehdi Hassan's ghazals. I can applaud Wasim Akram's out-swingers. Aren't these likes natural? Someone else's reaction is natural and when we do it, we are termed 'Pakistanis'. This loyalty test must stop immediately. In the speeches and writing of leaders associated with the Sangh and its off-shoots Muslims are portrayed as villains or people who bear multiple children. They disturb the balance of the population, have multiple marriages, are terrorists etc. Facts are distorted. Do you have any solid evidence to certify us as villains? Is there any solid research?When someone presents facts and research they are called liars and pseudo-seculars. Will these things be brought to an end? Will affiliates of the Sangh stop distributing certificates of nationalism? I would like to share an anecdote. As a child, I would visit my maternal grandmother’s house during my holidays and they owned cows and buffaloes. The cows on which Sangh is trying to put a trademark, we would feed fodder to them. And there were not one or two but tens of cattle. The milk of those cows was made available even to the Hindus who lived near by. But in the name of the cow, people are being lynched. I really liked what you had to say. But how will you put a stop to these lynchings? Will you work to ensure justice for their families? This question is related to love which is higher than the communal walls of separation. Love doesn’t differentiate between Hindu and Muslim. But you gave it the name of ‘Love Jihad’. Since Hindus and Muslims live together in India, they are bound to fall in love and get married. And you (Bhagwat) yourself said that all of us are Indians. So will you still call the relation between people of two different religions ‘Love Jihad’? Many Muslims don’t get a home or job because of their cap, beard or names like Ahmed and Khan. Will you stand by them? My questions are still the same. Will there be a change for real or have your words just fallen on deaf ears? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

But I am afraid I have another story to tell.  has described Prime Minister Modi as a “tinkerer”. I marginally disagree. I prefer to call his government a bunch of voluble, aggressive incremental-  who started with the “original sin” of swapping their “petrol bounty” for a tax-and-spend binge. Narendra Modi was Napoleon’s proverbial “lucky general”, the first to enjoy a single-party majority after India freed its economy in 1991. His fortune was compounded when Brent crude collapsed from $108 per barrel in 2014 to $30 per barrel in 2016. His government got a windfall gain of nearly $100 billion over three years. Just imagine if it had gifted this largesse to consumers by cutting fuel prices at the pump? What a tax stimulus it would have been for private demand and corporate investment. Instead, Modi doubled, even trebled, the taxes on oil to soak up the bonanza; and made the problem worse by spending it on grand welfare programmes that are notoriously inefficient and leaky. To illustrate just one stark example: 200,000 tonnes of grain was illegally diverted using dummy Aadhaar/biometric identities in   of Uttar Pradesh! Today, this “original sin” has trapped Modi in a pincer. As the dollar strengthened, and Brent crude leapt back to $80 per barrel, the Emperor is without his clothes. So, ladies and gentlemen, the chickens spawned by Modi’s “original petrol sin” are truly coming home to roost. This excited a chorus from my audience: Fine, we agree that he messed up India’s oil economy. But one swallow does not make a summer. How can you call him a statist on just one bad call? I: Okay then, here’s another egregious instance of oppressing minority shareholders and capturing the regulator. Early this year, the Modi government was woefully short of its disinvestment target. It needed emergency cash. So, it thought up this awful fix for its failure. The public sector oil exploration behemoth, ONGC, was coerced to pay nearly $6 billion to buy the government’s shares in HPCL. The oil minister defended this subterfuge to claim that such a “vertical merger” made business sense. But hey, it wasn’t a vertical  – if that had been done, ONGC would have saved $6 billion, aligning with the interests of millions of shareholders. Instead, the government had virtually oppressed the rights of minority shareholders by   picking up cash from ONGC’s balance sheet to fill its own coffers. Worse, it did not stop here. Under the law, ONGC was required to make an open offer for 26 percent additional shares, providing an exit to HPCL’s shareholders who wanted out of this transaction. It was naked regulatory capture by the Government of India. The sheer arrogance of “big government” was on display. Now the foreign investors fell silent. My words were sinking in. Yet a few voices piped up: Alright, those are two bad instances. This government has really done much better on several other scores. How can you ignore that? I was waiting for this cue. I latched on to it with undisguised glee. I: Ah ha, you want more evidence, right? About how Modi swears by the heavy hand of government control instead of the invisible hand of the market? I hope you do not enjoy the sorry spectacle about to unfold before you. After that, I let fly, rat-a-tat-a-tat: Clearly my audience had had enough. Most began to get up and leave the hall.

The Central Government has been firefighting allegations of massive corruption and cronyism over the mega defence deal. It has been accused of favouring the Anil Ambani owned Reliance Defence Limited over state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) which was to make 108 of the 126 aircraft   finalised by the previous government. On 22 September, the official handle of the BJP tweeted that there is incontrovertible evidence that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) had existed between Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of the Rafale aircraft, and Reliance Defence since February 2013, when the UPA government was in power. The same was reiterated by Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who tweeted a link to an article by   dated 13 February 2012, which reported that a defence pact was signed between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). Tajinder Bagga, who is the spokesperson of Delhi BJP  of screenshots of news reports about the pact. What is the story behind the BJP’s claim that Reliance Industries’ involvement in the Rafale agreement is the legacy of the erstwhile government? Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which had inked a defence pact in 2012, is headed by Mukesh Ambani. His brother Anil Ambani heads the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The demerger of Reliance Industries took place in 2005 after a public spat between the brothers which eventually saw their mother Kokilaben  . The current agreement is between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited, which was incorporated on 28 March 2015, days before the existing agreement was scrapped and a   was sealed in April 2015 for the purchase of 36 Rafale jets in a flyaway condition. Posted below are the details of Reliance Defence Limited available on the website of the  . As can be seen, the company was registered in Mumbai and incorporated on 28/03/2015. Reliance Defence Limited is an  and NOT Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) which is owned by Mukesh Ambani. The newspaper reports that the BJP is referring to were with regard to the agreement between Dassault Aviation and the Mukesh Ambani-owned RIL. Ironically, this seems to have escaped Tajinder Bagga’s notice, who tweeted screenshots of an article which featured a photograph of Mukesh Ambani. In 2012, Dassault Aviation and Reliance Industries Ltd. had  for partnering in the defence sector. This was shortly after the Rafale was chosen among a slew of Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) following extensive field trials.  reports that  BJP’s claim that Reliance Industries Ltd. was already party to the agreement signed by the previous government is, simply put, false. The   article that the party has referred to is about a defence pact that was signed between Dassault Aviation and RIL, which is owned by Mukesh Ambani whereas the current agreement has awarded the offset contract to Reliance Defence Ltd which is owned by his brother Anil Ambani. With the government tying itself in knots over its defense of the Rafale deal which has been mired in controversy, this attempt at eyewash is rather embarrassing.

Rahul Gandhi had, just a day before, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a thief in Rajasthan, to which Jaitley responded saying: The former finance minister also responded to Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on Rafale Deal being a ‘surgical strike.’ Following Jaitley’s allegations against Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge told ANI: Former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav reacting to the blame-game between the Congress and the BJP told ANI that the need of the hour was the drawing up of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to take control of the situation. “We demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Rafale deal. Without a JPC the truth will not come out, the issue has now become global,” he said. Addressing a press briefing, former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma said: “Union Ministers are trying to hide PM Narendra Modi’s lies. They repeatedly and blatantly lie. This shows the nature of the current government,” ANI reported. Adding that Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Jaitley were “competing” against one another to uphold Modi’s “lies”, Sharma said: “My message to Mr Modi is very clear. He cannot escape. All those who will try to cover up the scam of the century will be exposed. This has global ramifications.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Suhas Chakma,"The Maldives is all set to hold another deeply-rigged Presidential election on 23 September to ensure the return of President Abdullah Yameen to power for another term. The European Union and the United Nations have decided not to send election observers as Maldives has failed to “create the necessary atmosphere and trust for inclusive, credible and transparent presidential elections.” Yet, there is little international action against the dictatorship of President Yameen. India appears to be at a loss despite serious implications. Firstly, the election consolidates India’s striking loss of influence in the Maldives to China and Saudi Arabia, with serious implications for the maritime security in the Indian Ocean. The fallout will impact not just India but equally the United States, European Union, Japan and Australia which are the key stakeholders of the maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Thirdly, with Yameen’s connivance, the elections will consolidate the tightening grip of the religious extremists over the Maldives. The elections in the Maldives underline the extent of Indian foreign policy failure in the South Asian sub-region. China, which had no diplomatic representation before 2012, is now the Maldives’ closest ally. It is increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that every time India goes up against China in the neighbourhood, it loses leverage. Combined with China’s powerful position in Pakistan and its gains in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal, India has lost significant leverage in the region. The re-election of President Yameen on 23 September will have longer-term consequences for India. Given that the atolls of Maldives are sparsely populated, there is unlikely to be any country-wide democratic uprising against Yameen’s regime. the capital Malé, with a population of 150,000, has been the epicenter of the major democratic uprisings but the Maldives security forces appear capable of thwarting any challenge. All major opposition leaders are either in jail, under house arrest or in exile. Despotic rulers often use religion to garner popular support and prolong their rule. The Maldives was once a bastion of religious moderation. Today, religion is the political football of every election. All major parties try to outbid each other to demonstrate their conservative Islamic credentials. Electoral issues are reduced to candidate’s ability to portray as being the most Islamic, even though the country has far more pressing concerns than promoting faith. These electoral maneuverings reflect a more deeply-rooted problem. Beginning with ex-President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, religion has been used as a political tool for nation-building, and Islamisation has been a visible process. This process continued under the then President Mohammed Nasheed. The coalition government of Nasheed gave the tiny Islamist Adhaalath Party control over the Ministry of Religion. Given state control over mosques, in practice, this meant the Adhaalath Party was able to disseminate Islamist politics across the Maldives. The Adhaalath Party then expanded its influence into education. It issued   banning music, dancing, and dictated how women should dress and behave. The Islamists have pressed for and won significant changes to laws and regulations that solidified their authority over religious practice. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States continue to provide generous support for building mosques and religious education. President Yameen rewarded the Saudis by supporting its war in Yemen and severing diplomatic ties with Qatar. Maldives has so far provided the highest per capita recruitments to the ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but none of these ISIS recruits has been taken into custody on return. Terrorism can only flourish where governments are absent, enabling or ignoring the problem. That the religious extremist groups in the Maldives have been harassing and attacking media outlets, civil society groups and individuals with impunity proves that the Maldives is doing all three. The Maldives has taken ostensible counter-terror measures and enacted a new anti-terror legislation in October 2015.  Those convicted of terrorism include former President Mohammed Nasheed and former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, while those who have been charged with terrorism include the longest-serving President and former dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Supreme Court Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed, Justice Ali Hameed, four lawmakers including Gayoom’s son, Faris Maumoon and a former police commissioner. Quiet diplomacy or bilateral solution is no longer a viable option for India as President Yameen sees India inimical to his survival. India needs a new strategy. In response to the rigged elections, India should impose a travel ban and an asset freeze as the EU has done. Further, considering the maritime security in the Indian Ocean, India ought to see more value in a common position with the United States, European Union, Japan and Australia. India needs to bear in mind that whenever it sought to act alone whether in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it has found itself being portrayed as the neo-colonial power. Unless India changes its strategy, it is most likely to find its influence in South Asia substantially reduced if not isolated. Maldives is indeed the test case for India’s multilateral approach to effectively deal with the neighbourhood. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Aishwarya S Iyer,"MS Golwalkar, the second and longest-serving sarsanghchalak of RSS, was not mentioned by RSS's current chief Mohan Bhagwat during the lecture series that concluded on 19 September. At a three-day outreach event titled ‘Future of Bharat: An RSS perspective’ in New Delhi, Mohan Bhagwat laid bare his ideas of a future India. Not only did Bhagwat not mention Golwalkar, but also made statements on Muslims, the Indian National Congress and Communists, which are in stark contrast to the ideologies of the Sangh’s iconic sarsanghchalak Gowalkar. Mohan Bhagwat during the sessions said, “Sangh's ideology is Hindutva. (...) 'Unity is diversity' is our ideology which the world calls ‘Hindutva.’ And that’s why we call India a ‘Hindu Rashtra’.” Adding importantly, Golwalkar held a contradictory view on this. Golwalkar said, “On the contrary the Muslim menace has increased a hundred-fold by the creation of Pakistan which has become a springboard for all their future aggressive designs of our country."" In the book  , published in 1936, Golwalkar said: Bhagwat not only celebrated CPI-M founder MN Roy but also other noted personalities. This included poet Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, nuclear scientist APJ Abdul Kalam, and Verghese Kurien, father of the white revolution. Golwalkar, on the other hand, negated the ideology Roy contributed to. Mohan Bhagwat credited the Indian National Congress for initiating the freedom struggle, but Golwalkar felt the party was founded by the British to qwell the growing ‘nationalism’ in India. The only time Bhagwat mentioned Gowalkar was when he was asked a question on Golwalkar’s   where Muslims are called the shatru (enemy). To which he said, “As far as the   is concerned, every statement is specific to a context and circumstance. His enduring thoughts are in another popular edition in which we have removed all remarks that have a temporary context and retained those that will retain value for ages.

Ali Khan Mahmudabad,"Rule by ordinance has always been the weapon of choice for governments that are unable to get their way and need to circumvent democratic institutions. An ordinance criminalising   was recently passed by the Union Cabinet. There have been some (tragically) comic situations where men have tried to divorce their spouses through SMS, email and telephone calls, but as with all such things, they have been utterly blown out of proportion. The practice of   however, continues to be a political hot potato with various parties taking up strong positions against it, ostensibly to empower and liberate Muslim women. Before we get into a detailed discussion on   in India, it might be worthwhile to lay out a broader context and history. Here, it is important to mention that large sections of the Muslim population including the Shia and various Sunni groups, find no theological or jurisprudential basis for  . In 2017 there were 389 registered cases of   in a community, that by official accounts numbers at 160 million people in India alone. The practice of divorce is sanctioned by the Quran with a number of caveats. Chapter 4, Verse 35 says:  In Chapter 2, Verses 226-227 it is further said that:  There are a number of other verses 65:7 and 2:231, which deal with alimony as well as maintenance and providing accommodation for the divorcee. However, the verse which has been interpreted to sanction   is from Chapter 2, Verse 230.  is how the verse begins and the word   which is sometimes translated as ‘final’ or ‘absolute divorce’, was interpreted by some scholars as the third and final time. In this sense there is no explicit mention of   in the Quran. The original logic was not that divorce was pronounced three times in one go, but that after the first and second time, there should still be the possibility of   the divorce. Indeed in Sunni Muslim sources, there is a narration of Abdullah ibn Abbas about a famous wrestler Rukana ibn Abi Yazid who, in the heat of the moment, pronounced divorce three times and then regretted it. The Prophet then asked him to swear an oath about asking whether he intended a single divorce and when Rukana agreed, the divorce was treated as one that could be taken back. So we see then that there are Prophetic precedents that at the very least frown upon this practice. Of course the intricacies of the debates in the   or prophetic precedence, notwithstanding,  historically became common within certain Sunni communities, and indeed a large majority of both Shia and Sunni Muslims do not see it as a valid form of divorce. In Egypt, there is a legislation that grants women the unilateral right to divorce with or without the husband’s consent. It is evident that Muslim scholars have thought about this issue deeply but of course there is one main difference. The changes in these societies were organic. In other words, the reforms emerged from within and therefore, both the law and the authority behind the law were accepted by the people. It is not enough to just legislate change; it is equally important to consider the source of authority from which the law is derived. This is where the Indian situation is unique because   has become an issue that is clothed in the language of women’s empowerment but is essentially a political stick with which to beat the Muslim community. One is forced to wonder why on the one hand members of the government, such as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, make derogatory statements about Muslims and Muslim women in particular, while on the other hand their colleagues seek to empower them. Indeed, Prime Minister Modi’s recent visit to a Bohri gathering during Muharram raised the important question as to why he is silent on the issue of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is a practice that has still not been banned within the Bohra community. A number of Daudi Bohra women even wrote a letter to the Prime Minister raising their concerns about FGM, but it seems political considerations ultimately trump real issues. Ultimately, criminalising   is useless until and unless the issue is reformed from within the community. Indeed the ordinance begs the question as to why  needs to be penalised when the Surpreme Court has already said that a marriage will not stand dissolved if divorce is given by invoking  . Furthermore the question arises as to who will provide maintenance to the woman if the husband is jailed for three years? Reforms foisted in the name of empowerment will actually catalyze further conservatism, and women will inevitably suffer more. The inward turn is already evident in the positions of those Muslim scholars, such as various members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, who are opposing the ordinance while personally rejecting the practice of  . However, perhaps the real intentions of the current government is to actually further entrench the ‘siege mentality’ among Muslims. Ultimately, real reform cannot take place if people do not trust the source of the law. Of course, there is the point of view that sometimes change needs to be imposed regardless of whether the community is ready to accept it or not, and indeed this is one way in which 18th and 19th century liberal philosophers justified imperialism as a civilizing process. The reaction to this conceit is there for everyone to see in the form of the various religious reform movements that entrenched certain forms of orthodoxy. We are still facing the effects of these movements today. As the Supreme Court said it will not be using another source of authority apart from the Quran, but the problem is that the timing and context in which this law is being advocated cannot be divorced from the prevalent political context. Perhaps the wisest course of action would have been to let leaders from those sects who practice  sit with judges, jurists and lawyers to forge a path which will catalyze change organically, while also giving it the weight of the law. However, this would require politicians to actually have a political vision that goes beyond the next elections.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"It is no exaggeration to say that South Kashmir – especially Shopian district – is facing an “unprecedented wave of terror”. The   of three special police officers (SPOs) in Shopian’s Kapran area on Friday, 21 September has sent shockwaves across the families of 1.3 lakh police personnel, including 30,000 SPOs, in Jammu and Kashmir. Within three hours of the assassinations, SPOs and their terribly anxious family members in Shopian, Kulgam and Pulwama districts were seen delivering resignation letters to Imams of local mosques, imploring them to make announcement at the congregational prayers in the afternoon. Though senior police officials insisted that most resignations were “rumours”, reliable sources across South Kashmir told  that more than 30 resignations of police officials and SPOs were announced at the community mosques. Three body bags from the Valley’s militant-infested swathes of apple orchards came days after Hizbul Mujahideen chief Riyaz Naikoo issued “final warning” to the SPOs. In an audio clip – that went viral in social media – Naikoo asked all SPOs to quit their police jobs in four days, before the deadline of 19 September, and sit home. He alleged that the SPOs – who get Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 – a month, were used for gathering information about militants’ movement and hideouts. That helped police and security forces to plan and execute their operations, he added. However, till late on Friday night, neither Hizbul Mujahideen nor any other militant outfit neither claimed nor disowned the killings, but everybody seemed to believe that Naikoo’s guerrilla group had begun to enforce the threat. However, with no murmur of protest, or even a call for shutdown, its ownership was evident. Four SPOs and their family members, who spoke to   in the Shopian-Kulgam belt on condition of anonymity, maintained invariably that there was an “unprecedented wave of terror” across South Kashmir. “Farooq Abdullah alone has issued an unqualified condemnation. Did you notice that even Omar Abdullah and BJP leaders are mute spectators to today’s bloodshed”, one of the SPOs said. “Not a single candidate has filed nomination papers for municipal elections across Central and South Kashmir in the first four days of the process. Such is the level of fear here”, said one SPO’s father. All the four families maintained that another group killing would lead to “  resignation” of all SPOs, even many constables. “The state government itself has shamelessly failed to either regularise or enhance the honorarium of the SPOs. We are told that the Centre has approved a major enhancement six months back, but the State has no will to bring any relief to them,” said another SPO’s brother, who is a schoolteacher. However, most of the people interviewed in Srinagar and Budgam districts, believe that the main task at hand for the militants was to ensure failure of the municipal and panchayat election, to be held in the Valley from September to November. They argued that in absence of other potential targets, like candidates and voters, militants would, for now, continue to strike on the unarmed SPOs and policemen. “As of now, we are facing the brunt. But, in the days to come, they may resort to political killings and kidnappings as they want to ensure that nobody participates in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections due in 2019 and 2020, respectively,” said another SPO. Of the 37 police personnel killed until 21 September this year, 10 are SPOs. Some of the situation analysts believe that the government’s unnecessary hype to the regularisation of SPOs, coupled with enhancement of their honorarium and substantial hike to their ex-gratia relief in case of death, had provoked the militants to increase pressure on this much-harassed lot of irregulars. However, documentation and tabulations at the J&K police headquarters indicate that targeting the police personnel became a concerted drive only after Mufti Mohammad Sayeed took over as Chief Minister and head of the truncated PDP-BJP coalition in March 2015. Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir zone, Swayam Prakash Pani, cautioned that many of these resignations were “fake”. He argued that even three or four of such announcements from among a community of 30,000 SPOs would not terrorise or demoralise them or their families. According to him, the police and security forces, in the last less than nine months, had eliminated 28 militants in Shopian alone. “We have shattered their support structure with arrest of several OGWs (over-ground workers). They are under tremendous pressure from several quarters. These acts of fratricide from them speak volumes about their level of frustration and desperation,” he said. Director General of Police (DGP), Dilbag Singh, reassured the traumatised SPOs and their families that the police department would leave no stone unturned to secure their life and properties. He asserted that a major relief and rehabilitation incentive would unfold for these families in near future. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Subhash Chandra,"Mayawati has announced an alliance with Ajit Jogi’s Janata Congress in Chhattisgarh. This is a setback for the Congress as the party will be under pressure to offer more seats to the BSP in Madhya Pradesh. While   is asking for 50 seats currently, Congress is willing to offer less than 30 seats. The current political scenario suits well for the Congress which can wrest both Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh from the BJP. Three factors which can work in favour of the Grand Old Party include: In MP, the per capita GDP growth has constantly touched below 5 percent, at least three times in the last five years, whereas between 2008 to 2013, it went below 5 percent only once. Chhattisgarh which was once considered to be a leader in growth has been a laggard since 2014 owing to low prices of ores (45 percent of GDP is dependent on industry). While the state has recovered to some extent, it is still lagging behind other states. Given the current state of affairs, it sounds like a great opportunity for the Congress party. In the last five elections, from 1993 to 2013, voters in both MP and Chhattisgarh have changed their respective government only once. While Congress has enjoyed three terms, BJP has had a stint in power for as many as six times to date Unlike other states, voters here are far less volatile. If one combines the votes of MP and Chhattisgarh and take a look at the 20-year-period between 1993 and 2013, here are some statistics: BSP had an average vote share of 6.7 percent between 1993 and 2013 in MP and Chhattisgarh. This is significant by any standard given the fact that the average gap in vote share between BJP and Congress has been 5.2 percent between 1993 and 2013 with the difference touching almost 7.6 percent in the last three elections (MP and Chhattisgarh combined). If one were to look at Chhattisgarh alone, the gap in vote share between BJP and Congress in the last three elections was 1.7 percent. With BSP having about 4.4 percent share in Chhattisgarh in 2013, an alliance with Congress would have been a big advantage there. Now with BSP aligning with Ajit Jogi, Congress will not only have to deal with some loss of its own vote, it will also lose some vote because voters might find the new alliance to be more viable. It could, in turn, be a disaster for Congress in Chhattisgarh. Overall, with voters who are less volatile and BJP having a reasonable advantage, Congress would have been in a comfortable position if the party had BSP on board as an ally. An alliance with BSP would have meant a significant reduction in the gap between BJP and Congress-led alliance. Instead, the Congress will now have to manufacture a swing of 4-5 percent in MP and 3-4 percent in Chhattisgarh on its own to defeat BJP. In Chhattisgarh, the absence of a strong leader within Congress puts it at an even bigger disadvantage. While Mayawati’s announcement has put a spanner in the works, the Congress party still has some time to save itself in MP. The question is : Can they do it?

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat's statement that many assertions of the second chief Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, have outlived their utility because these were made in a specific historical context, is not the first time that he and the Sangh Parivar have distanced themselves from Golwalkar's contentious positions. But public reiteration of departure from some controversial positions of one of the two most revered leaders of the RSS in the course of the highly publicised event, is no ordinary matter. Besides possibly marking a turning point in the form and content of RSS' public engagement, Bhagwat's assertion also indicates efforts of the leadership to somewhat reposition the Sangh in efforts to retrieve middle-India which has moved away, especially from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – which remains central to the Parivar's future prospects despite claims to the contrary – since 2014. On the third and concluding day of his Future of Bharat lecture series, Bhagwat was asked if the RSS still stood by the offensive words Golwalkar used for Muslims in the anthology of his statements,  , long considered one of the holy books within RSS circles. The question assumed significance in view of the interpretation of his assertion in the course of the second day's lecture. He said, “ ” (that although India is a ‘Hindu Rashtra’, it does not mean that there should be no Muslims. The day it is said that there should be no Muslims, that day will mark the end of Hindutva). For years, the RSS has been accused of opposing the fundamentals of the Indian Republic. Besides, the organisation's stand towards religious minorities – mainly Muslims and Christians – have been flagged. Not just that, RSS has also been accused of not paying adequate respect to the Indian flag besides remaining critical of the freedom struggle. Golwalkar was at the epicentre of most of these critical comments because he was possibly the most vituperative of all chiefs till date, although many would consider KS Sudarshan to be in a similar mould despite the canvas of his intellectual engagement being extremely limited. But to get a perspective of the distancing from the Golwalkar line, there is a need to recall a certain timeline. When he took over the RSS in July 1940 after the demise of founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Golwalkar faced considerable hostility because he made a lateral entry into the RSS. He overcame this through different means, and claimed authorship of  , published in March 1939 provided him with intellectual gravitas. It was not widely known in Sangh circles for almost two-and-a-half decades that the book was not written by Golwalkar. It was in fact, written in Marathi by GD (Babarao) Savarkar, the brother of VD Savarkar who penned   – the watershed monograph that partially inspired Hedgewar into establishing the RSS.  , as Babarao's book was titled, was published in 1934 and although senior leaders knew about this, there was no effort made in public to clarify that Golwalkar was not its author. In popular perception, he was its author. The first edition of the book was interspersed with ""intemperate language"" and these were cleaned out in the second edition. The third and final reprint of the book was in 1947. Finally in 1963, Golwalkar announced that it had in fact been an abridged version of Babarao Savarkar's book but put the blame on a person he handed over the translation to for publication. No explanation was offered on not clarifying for long that he didn’t author the book. The RSS said in a statement that the book did not represent ""the views of the grown (sic) Guruji or of the RSS."" Previously, when Golwalkar disassociated from the book in 1963, RSS circles felt the need to put some text that could be ascribed to him. The book had a chapter on Internal Threats with sub-sections on Muslims, Christians and Communists. The sub-chapter on Muslims argued that Muslims pursued a two-fold strategy after partition – ""direct aggression"" and ""swelling numbers"". Golwalkar claimed that not all ""pro-Pakistan elements"" had gone away and instead the ""Muslim menace has increased a hundred-fold."" By the time RSS formally put out the statement, distancing themselves from  , the organisation had also published the twelve-volume   or Collected Works. In the Prastavana or prologue that Bhagwat penned, he used almost the same words as he did on Wednesday that ""time is progressive and situations change"" as a result of which, there is need to separate the contemporaneous comments from the eternal. In fact, even before Bhagwat, Sudarshan laid the ground to intellectually distance the RSS from several of Golwalkar's accusatory comments and observations. By 2005-06 when the Collected Works were published and the RSS distanced itself from   the Sangh Parivar had been confronted with the demands of the coalition era and realised growth would be hindered by sticking to moribund concepts. Sudarshan in his  or Preface wrote that Golwalkar's views could be classified into two categories: ""first which are eternal or timeless and the other which reflect the state of nation and the period."" It cannot be said that these views will be ""applicable as it is"" to contemporary situations. While neither Sudharshan's comments nor Bhagwat's words denounced Golwalkar, the observations clearly conveyed that the RSS top brass realised that their iconic sarsanghchalak had to be eased out of the picture, or at least some of his comments which could impede further growth of the RSS had to be foregone. But evidently, Bhagwat realised – and he would have secular clearance certainly from a larger body of RSS leaders before airing his thoughts – that it was necessary to restate this opinion of the RSS. From a close reading of several of nuanced statements made by Bhagwat and other RSS leaders, resolutions and deliberations of various representatives in recent years – especially over the past few months – indicate that there has been realisation of the need to reaffirm its past position. It also appears that the RSS has accepted that there would be limits to its growth if it continued to have the image of being opposed to minorities, Dalits and the Constitution. It, however, is premature to say that the RSS is turning a corner because there is considerable gap between theory and practice. Between what Bhagwat professed from Vigyan Bhawan and what is carried out in the name of Hindutva on the streets of India. Yet, there is no denying that future assertions of the RSS leadership will have to be watched in new light. It has obviously realised the present road has certain limits which are close at hand. The call for tracking RSS and developments within in new light may appear slightly contradictory in the backdrop of past analysis of developments within RSS, and even Bhagwat's statements, but if there is never a dull moment in India, how can RSS-watching remain an unvarying exercise?

Raghav Bahl,"The University of Delhi (DU) immeasurably helped to create Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political brand. His sprint towards the stunning 2014 victory had begun on 6 February 2013 at  . The auditorium was packed with students eager to listen to his sermon on the Gujarat model of development. A bevy of television channels were going live across the country, to an audience of hundreds of millions of curious viewers. The Gujarat Chief Minister was very nervous about this outing. Why? Because Modi had a complex about his lack of facility in English; he feared being mocked by DU’s hip and elite students. Yet he spoke passionately in Hindi for 75 minutes. His rousing speech was peppered with words that were to become his trademark through that extraordinary campaign:   (20 times);   (16);   (15);   (12);   (180)! Two thousand students sprung to their feet in a standing ovation that seemed to last forever, resonating across the country. Modi himself was astonished at the applause. Then it came to him in a flash. He could win the following year, riding on the mantra of hope, youth, aspiration, development, more development, and even more development; it was irrelevant to his constituency whether he spoke in Hindi or English. There are four other reasons why DU, and what happens on that campus, is crucial for Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): Given the above reasoning, it’s irrefutable that vote shares thrown up in DUSU elections should give vital clues about the national political mood. I also concede that psephologically, these polls do not make for a scientific sample; so, it would be foolish to project the NDA’s or UPA’s gains or losses from these numbers. But can you glean some tangible insights into the upcoming 2019 battle? You bet! Here are the key data pointers from the DUSU polls: Now to the next critical question: Does the DUSU data synch with other inputs? Does it violate or validate what other credible sources are throwing up? Because if it does validate, then our inferences would have a stronger ring of truth, right? Let me recall the   we had done on by-elections held after the Gujarat polls of December 2017. This by-election data is “circumstantially random”, since no systematic bias gets created when legislators die or resign. Here, then, are the contours of our “real world sample” of ten parliamentary and 21 Assembly by-elections, spread over 15 states, in which over 1.25 crore people cast their votes for nearly 19 political parties: There is an almost perfect overlap between the DUSU poll numbers and the by-elections’ real voting data: We can now say, with a huge amount of confidence, that vote shares across the country are hardening at 36 percent for NDA, 32 percent for UPA, 14 percent for potentially anti-BJP regional parties, and 18 percent for the rest. But wait. Whenever I have done the above analysis, I have been energetically accosted by pro-Modi experts for ignoring a crucial variable (or imponderable):  . They argue, quite justifiably, that all this data was gathered when      . They assert, again justifiably, that he has a “delta” in which    , not for the BJP or RSS or any other factor. I readily concede this argument. There is a “peak Modi” phenomenon, that is, if Modi is in the fray, they would vote for him, irrespective of whether they had voted for non-BJP outfits in other elections. Now, is there a way we can estimate “peak Modi”? Yes, there is: In the ultimate analysis then, we could be looking at the following score: So, who will win? Go figure.

The Quint,"The Modi government’s deal to buy 36 French Rafale fighter jets has whipped up a political storm in India – again. Former French President Francis Hollande on Friday, 21 September, triggered a massive uproar in the Opposition camp when he claimed that France was not given an option of choosing a local partner for Dassault Aeronautics. In other words, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence was chosen by the Modi government. The TV channels, with the exception of NDTV, chose to mostly stay silent on this big development. They did, however, react to the news on Saturday morning. It was the same case with most Hindi newspapers. India’s big English dailies, meanwhile, gave space to the news on their front pages with varying angles. A day before Hollande’s claims were out, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had   Congress President Rahul Gandhi a “clown prince” for his allegations related to the Rafale deal. But after the shocking claims were out,   asked emphatically in its lead story’s headline on the front page, “Who is the clown now?” In its extensive report,   gave significant prominence and space to the developments, including statements of Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Nirmala Sitharaman, defending the choice of Ambani’s Reliance Defence for being a part of the deal. The daily quoted from PTI’s midnight report, stating the French government’s stance that it was in no way “involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners.” In a picture showing the bonhomie between Hollande and PM Modi, the caption interestingly read: “Who should we trust, messieurs?” On a day marked by major news breaks, right from India-Pakistan meeting being called off to the murder of the policemen in Kashmir,   rose to the occasion with a lead story on Hollande’s latest claims on the front page. Its headline highlighted the daunting claims by both parties: “Govt denied role but ex-President Hollande says: Indian Govt proposed Reliance, had no choice”. “Isn’t that a decision for a commercial enterprise to take on their own?” the IE report quoted Sitharaman outrightly denying the claims of her involvement. The latter part of its report focused on how closely connected were the two developments, i.e. Reliance Entertainment entering an agreement to produce Hollande’s partner’s film two days before PM Modi and Hollande signed the Rafale deal MoU. As of now, Sitharaman, who was expected to meet her French counterpart in a meeting later this week, has called it off,   reported. In a   front-page story headlined,  the report quotes Hollande’s interview to French website Mediapart stating that the Indian government had proposed Reliance Defence as the Indian partner in the 36-fighter jet deal, and that France had “no say in this regard.” The report further states that Hollande’s comments contradict the government’s “long-held” stance that it was Rafale manufacturer Dassault that had picked the Anil Ambani group as its India partner, and that the government had nothing to do with this process. Its sister publication,   had the story below on the front page had only a page on Hollande’s claim with the rest focusing on Congress’ aggressive stance in the controversy. , the largest Hindi daily, had this story appearing on the 11th page, while its counterpart,   placed the story on its 13th page. Another front-page report appeared on  covering Hollande’s comments to the Paris-based investigative website . The daily’s report featured as the second story on Page 1, talking about how the controversy has triggered a “political tug of war”. It also mentioned Rahul Gandhi’s tweet in which he accused PM Modi of having “changed the deal behind closed doors”. Even as Hollande's comments sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, most TV channels chose to awkwardly silent on the matter. Republic TV, founded by BJP MP Rajeev Chandrashekhar, chose to avoid discussing the matter on prime time. Co-founder and anchor Arnab Goswami discussed India rejecting talks with Pakistan, the politics of surgical strikes and the arrest of rape accused Bishop Mullakal,   stated in its story. According to the report, this is how rival channel Times Now's Rahul Shivshankar reported the news on Hollande's comments: “..But today IF this particular tweet that QUOTES an ALLEGED interview by Francois Hollande, the former French President is to be believed, then, then, there’s reason to doubt the government’s claims, because what has ALLEGEDLY Francois Hollande said?

Quint Entertainment,"Producer Aanand L. Rai has spoken out about the ongoing Manmarziyaan controversy, taking responsibility for ordering voluntary cuts to the film. In a statement to  , Aanand said, “ The decision of deleting the scenes was taken by Colour Yellow Productions. I thought if they are hurting someone’s sentiments, I might as well take them out as that’s not what my film is about.” Aanand added that he understood Anurag Kashyap’s hurt feelings over the cuts, but he had to take a practical decision since exhibitors in Punjab and Jammu were refusing to screen  . Earlier, Eros had responded to Anurag’s accusation that they were responsible for the cuts with a statement. “Colour Yellow is the creative producer on Manmarziyaan. We have the deepest respect for all communities and it is our intention to maintain neutrality and never intentionally hurt or disrespect any religion or community. We have the greatest respect for the law of the land and follow and implement all guidance of the Censor Board which is the supreme authority for film content in the country.” A scene in Anurag Kashyap’s latest film   has reportedly left some members of the Sikh community disgruntled. A Sikh organisation filed a petition against the film in the Jammu wing of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Tuesday, 18 September, pushing the director to issue a clarification. A scene in the film shows Robbie (Abhishek Bachchan) removing his turban before going away from his house for a smoke. Since Sikhism prohibits smoking or the use of tobacco, the scene caused a controversy and was deleted from the film’s screenings in Punjab. Later after a netizen pointed out the CBFC cuts in the film, the director had a sardonic reply for those ‘threatened by films’! Despite getting the censor board clearance, the tweet points out the voluntary deletions in the film, at the behest of the producers and even lauds the ‘self-censorship’. Kashyap took to Twitter to respond to the smoking controversy recently. Anurag shared how they shot the film in Amritsar constantly taking into account what might or might not be proper so as to not hurt religious sentiments. Before shooting that particular scene, the team also took advice from locals on how to go about it. The intention was never to hurt, he says, but the film is about three characters and not their religion. Is anyone listening? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Calling it an auspicious day when BJP MP Nishikant Dubey came to his village Godda in Jharkhand for the foundation laying ceremony of a bridge, Pawan, in his complaint, has said that his request to clean and wipe Dubey’s feet was declined by the MP initially by saying that “he will never allow it happen”. Pawan’s written complaint further mentions that after the BJP MP declined his request, the villagers protested in unison. Pawan then said that he requested MP Dubey to allow him to clean his feet as “it is a centuries-old ritual to clean the feet of a guest and a guru”. “If I am not given this opportunity, I will harm myself with a knife since I have got this opportunity to clean and wipe the feet of Shri Dubey after so much persuasion.” Alleging manipulation of facts by the camerapersons, Pawan further wrote in his complaint that some camerapersons captured this incident on their cameras and broadcasted the incident by manipulating facts across the country. In his complaint, Pawan has also alleged that the broadcast of this news on TV and in newspapers in a “twisted way” has caused “him and his family mental agony”.

Even though the streaming platform replaced the controversial English subtitle, it refused to remove the contentious bit. And the Delhi HC judges hearing the case said on 8 August, “Nobody is pressing or forcing you. You take your own decision, whether you want to change the word or not.” Petitioner advocate Nikhil Bhalla however, is not willing to give up the battle so easily. He has now amended his petition to ask the government to create a regulatory board for online streaming companies. According to  , Bhalla wants to ensure no such controversial content slips into the digital entertainment platforms. The next hearing for this case will be held on October 20. The Indian government is now seriously examining regulating online content through an IT Ministry committee. (Source:  ) (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Almost two weeks after the Jammu and Kashmir government appointed Dilbagh Singh as the interim Director General of Police (DGP), the Supreme Court has directed Singh to continue in the position till the UPSC submits its reply with respect to the names of senior police officers for regular appointment within five weeks. Singh, who is also Director General (Prisons), was given additional charges of the DGP after former police chief SP Vaid was unceremoniously removed on late Thursday, 6 September, and shunted as the Transport Commissioner. The state government, meanwhile, approached the Supreme Court to explain the reason behind appointing an interim Director General of Police in the state without consulting the Union Public Service Commission, as mandated by the apex court in July 2018, officials said. Standing counsel for the state, Shoeb Alam mentioned about the application before Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, they said. In its application, the state informed the apex court that Jammu and Kashmir police, which has been fighting militancy for the last three decades, cannot be left headless for “even a minute”, and therefore, the decision was taken by the administration on Thursday night. In July, the top court had taken note of an application filed by the Centre in which it claimed that certain states have been appointing acting police chiefs and making them permanent just before the date of their superannuation to enable them get the benefit of an additional two-year tenure till the age of 62 years. A bench including Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, then, passed a slew of directions for appointment of state police chiefs. Chronicling the steps to being taken for appointment of the police chiefs, the apex court had said, ""All the states shall send their proposals in anticipation of the vacancies to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) well in time, at least three months prior to the date of retirement of the incumbent on the post of Director General of Police"". ""An endeavour has to be made by all concerned to see that the person who was selected and appointed as the DGP continues despite his date of superannuation,"" the bench said, adding that the extended term beyond the date of superannuation should be a reasonable period. Ousted DGP SP Vaid told ANI that this is a part of the job, replying to a question on whether his transfer was unexpected. Hours after the announcement, Vaid on Twitter expressed his gratitude to the Jammu and Kashmir police, security agencies and the people of J&K for “their support and their faith” in him, and conveyed his wishes to the new DGP. He also appealed for an end to the ""cycle of death"" in the Valley. The official order to this effect was issued on 6 September 2018 by Principal Secretary, Home, RK Goyal. The government order comes as a part of reshuffle of the state’s top-level police officers. Just two days earlier, on 4 September, Vaid’s deputy Abdul Gani Mir was replaced by Dr B Srinivas as the new Additional Director General of CID. The transfer of officials comes a week after terrorists abducted 12 relatives of police officers in south Kashmir. They were all released unharmed, but only after the father of a top Hizbul Mujahideen was released. This incident is  to be one of the reasons behind Vaid's ouster. According to media reports, the relationship between Vaid and the state administration under Governor's rule had become strained recently. The former DGP's stance regarding the Kathua case also widened his rift with the BJP, an NDTV  said citing sources. On 4 September, Vaid tweeted that the state police has been fighting a proxy war for decades and it required courage and determination. Vaid, a 1986-batch IPS officer, was appointed as the Director General of Police in December 2016. He was due to retire in October next year. Dilbagh Singh, who has been made the in-charge Director General of Police, is a 1987-batch officer. He was made the head of the prison department in March after the infamous escape of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Naved Jhatt while the latter was on a routine health check-up at a city hospital in February, reported PTI. Singh, during his tenure as Director General of Prisons, streamlined many things, including the removal of hardened terrorists from Kashmir jails, reported PTI. He will have a regular appointment only after his name is cleared by the UPSC. According to PTI, some more orders are likely to come, in which Arun Chaudhury is likely to be appointed as the Director General of Prisons, and SJM Gilani as the Additional Director General of the Jammu and Kashmir Armed Police. Notably, Dilbagh Singh faced suspension as the Deputy Inspector General of Anantnag in 2000 for his alleged involvement in a recruitment scam,  NDTV. Former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah hit out at the Governor-ruled state saying that there was no hurry to replace the police chief. “He should have been changed only when a permanent arrangement had been worked out,” Abdullah tweeted.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"On 17 September, five militants masquerading as mediapersons barged into the home of Territorial Army soldier Mukhtar Ahmad Malik in Churat, in southern Kashmir’s Kulgam district, and shot him dead. The local counter-insurgent Malik (43) had been living at the fortified Ikhwan Colony at the district headquarters, after being absorbed into the Army increased the potential of threat to his life. On 2 September, his 19-year-old son Shariq Ahmad Malik’s Maruti car got crushed in a head-on collision with another vehicle. Shariq, who was driving to a grocery in Kulgam town, was critically injured. He was rushed to the Army’s 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar where he succumbed to “severe maxillofacial trauma with irreversible hypovolemic shock and anoxic brain injury” on 15 September. For the Rasm-e-Qul, he went back to his village on 17 September. Within hours of Malik’s arrival, he was killed. Malik was attacked and eliminated days after a pall of gloom spoiled a family’s twin marriage ceremonies at Harwan Sopore. Javed Ahmad Lone (32), father of three children, was one among the two militants killed in an encounter by security forces at Galoora, Handwara. His brother’s marriage had completed on 10 September, but his body reached home when his sister’s wedding was well underway on 11 September.  After his release from jail, Lone had disappeared in February and surfaced on Facebook in July with a gun on his shoulders. He had reportedly joined Lashkar-e-Tayyiba on 8 July, the death anniversary of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani.  Coincidentally the bride of the 20-year-old Tahir Makhdoomi of Tujjar Sharief, who was lifted by the Army from his home on the first night after his wedding on 12 September 2003 and blown into pieces with an improvised explosive device, was also from Handwara-Sopore area. While the operations by Police and security forces on such occasions are nothing new, Malik’s murder on the eve of the fourth-day ritual of his teenage son marks a shift in the militants’ decades-long policy of not killing anybody during mourning or marriage. One odd precedence in a decade was that of the 22-year-old Lieutenant Umar Fayaz, who was kidnapped from his cousin’s wedding at Batpora Matribug village in Shopian district, on the night of 9 May 2017 and was shot dead at the nearby Harmain village. “This is clearly to strike a wave of terror and sabotage the upcoming municipal and panchayat elections,” said a senior officer of the Jammu and Kashmir Police. “But we are fully prepared to deal with such militants. We have identified both groups of terrorists involved in the two incidents on Monday.” Yet another top-ranking police officer claimed that the militants were resorting to civilian and unarmed police killings to stay relevant, as demonstrations and stone pelting (on security forces) were “remarkably receding”. “We are sure they wouldn’t be able to cause much fear or damage to the elections. As against 76 last year, we have eliminated 70 of them in South Kashmir in the last eight-and-a-half months of the current year. We have dismantled their leadership. As against 10 dreaded commanders in September 2017, they are now left with only Zeenatul Islam and Riyaz Naikoo of Hizbul Mujahideen besides the low-lying Zakir Musa. This has turned them desperate and they have started hitting at soft targets,” the officer told  on condition of anonymity. After a chain of threats over the last one year, a formidable guerrilla group in southern Kashmir’s Tral, has purportedly issued a serious warning. “We will be constrained to kill the family members of all those policemen who fail to respond to this appeal and do not resign in the next four days,” an unidentified person, perceived to be a militant commander, is heard as saying. Police and security forces are groping in the dark in the absence of clarity in the counterinsurgency policies of the government. Shesh Pal Vaid being replaced by Dilbag Singh as Director General of Police on 6 September, owes much to this confusion. “The erstwhile PDP-BJP government’s blurred CI policies are still in place. In her last Unified Headquarters meeting on 12 May, (then) Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti directed us to scale down our operations. After the imposition of Governor’s Rule on 18 June, there has been no Unified Headquarters meeting and consequently no change of policy,” said an Army officer. On 5 July, visiting Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, along with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, had a meeting with senior Army, Police and civil officers. It had no agenda. On 10 August, former Governor N N Vohra chaired his last meeting with senior military, paramilitary, intelligence and police officers. The militants in fact, changed some of their policies considerably in the last two years. In over two decades, there were only a few instances of attacks and assassinations around the festivals of Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha. Retired police officers insist that DIG Crime & Railways Mohammad Amin Bhat’s assassination, after the conclusion of Eid-ul-Azha prayers at a mosque at Baghat Barzulla in Srinagar on 2 February 2002, was “not a targeted killing”. National Conference leader and slain Law Minister Mushtaq Lone’s brother Ghulam Mohiuddin Lone was shot dead immediately after he reached his home in Sogam, Kupwara, in his Zen car, a day before Eid on 5 December 2002. Mohiuddin Lone was a pioneering militant who surrendered and joined talks along with a few others, with the Government of India, in 1996. Dental surgeon Mushtaq Ahmad Shah was kidnapped from his residential area of Handwara and subsequently slaughtered at Nopora Kalan, on Sopore outskirts, two days before Eid-ul-Fitr on 9 October 2006. Days before, militants had beheaded a Territorial Army soldier. Contrarily, 2017 and 2018 witnessed enormous bloodshed on both the festivals of Eid. Deputy SP Ayub Pandith was lynched to death by a frenzied mob that was shouting pro-Zakir Musa slogans at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid. Two days before Eid-ul-Fitr, on 23 June 2017, one policeman was killed. On the eve of Eid-ul-Azha on 1 September 2017, several were injured in a militant attack at Panta Chowk in Srinagar The worst occurred in 2018. On the same day, militants kidnapped a soldier, Aurangzeb, at Qalampora Pulwama and shot him dead after physically torturing him. On his way to celebrate Eid with his family in Poonch, Aurangzeb was reportedly charged with ‘desecration’ of the top ranking militant Sameer Tiger’s body. Eid-ul-Azha followed with more bloodletting. Posted in Budgam, Inspector Mohammad Ashraf Dar celebrated Eid with his family at Larav in Pulwama district on 22 August. Militants barged into his home that day, shooting him dead. Constable Mohammad Yaqoob Shah was gunned down earlier the same day at his home in Pulwama’s Louswani village. Two more policemen survived attempts on their life on the same day in Pulwama district. Constable Fayaz Ahmad Shah of Zazripora, Kulgam, was shot dead while he was returning home with his two daughters, aged five and two years, after attending the Eid congregational prayers at the adjoining village Awgam. Resistance by his relatives failed to stop the assassins. “Another policeman murdered in Kashmir. Inspector Mohd Ashraf Dar was killed in south Kashmir a short while ago. ‘Outraged’ doesn’t even begin to describe how one feels, and that feeling is multiplied many times over by the fact that it’s happened on Eid, a day of prayer and reflection,” former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted. The night before this, BJP worker Shabir Ahmad Bhat was kidnapped from his home in Kupwara district and shot dead near Rakh-e-Littar village.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Sabika Razvi,"East Turkestan, a sprawling region which is roughly half the size of India in China’s west, is home to a Turkic-speaking Muslim ethnic minority, called the Uyghurs. The region was annexed by China in 1949 and renamed Xinjiang, literally meaning “new region”. The authorities in China and the Uyghurs have a long history of discord, but recently, reports of the government detaining Uyghurs in Nazi-style concentration camps have been mounting. A panel of  recently said Uyghurs in Xinjiang were being treated as “enemies of the state” and announced that it had received credible reports about the “arbitrary and mass detention of almost one million Uyghurs” in “counter-extremism centres.” Adil Cinar, a Muslim Uyghur born in Xinjiang, has 61 close family members, relatives and friends who he believes are held in concentration camps. “Last I heard, my brother-in-law was taken from his home and sentenced for 15 years. And my aunt's husband has already died in the concentration camp on 2 August after being kept there since the beginning of this year,” he tells  . After having left Xinjiang at the age of 19, Adil fears he can never go back to his hometown as the situation continues to deteriorate every single day. “I’ve worked as a volunteer for the World Uyghur Congress in Germany since 2014 and Uyghur Human Rights project in USA. I’ve gone to China many times for collecting information about the victims of the killing and persecution in my region.” Many exiles are becoming strangers in their own country. They believe they will not be allowed to leave Xinjiang if they visit the region today. But almost every single Uyghur living abroad has one or more family members locked up in concentration camps. “This genocide against the Uyghur Muslims has already come to its last pace (sic) and the whole world is still thinking that the Chinese government is just trying to do that,” says an impassioned Adil Cinar. Those from the community estimate the numbers could be much higher than one million. Uyghurs – who primarily practise Islam, form a majority in the region, among other minorities including Kazaks, Kyrgyz, Tatars, Uzbeks, and Tajiks – are fast being replaced with Han Chinese, who began migrating to this part of Central Asia after its annexure. Chinese authorities are prosecuting and conducting mass “re-education” centres to force Uyghurs to denounce their religion. In an attempt to suppress Uyghur culture and religious practices, the women are being forced to marry Han Chinese males, the religious leaders are being coerced into performing dance routines on the streets, and made to eat pork. Uyghur women are not allowed wear the hijab, or fast during Ramadan. The authorities can come knocking at your door without warning if you grow a beard, or name your child Muhammad or Medina. China is attempting to drive a wedge between Uyghurs and Islam. And they are using any excuse to persecute them. “Uyghurs are not allowed to carry or own any weapons. If you have a knife with you, you can be thrown into jail,” says  , Uyghur activist and researcher. In 1949, the population of Han Chinese in Xinjiang was only 6 percent, while 82 percent of the population in Xinjiang were Uyghurs. “We’re a minority community, but in Xinjiang, we form a majority,” says Abdugheni. According to  Xinjiang’s Han population has increased in the region from 2,20,000 in 1949, to 8.4 million in 2008. “When I was a kid, you could hardly see Han Chinese in the cities, there were only Chinese troops in the places called Xinjiang production and construction corporation,” recalls Adil Cinar. Much of this migration is credited to the Chinese Government’s incentives to migrate into the region. “After the railway connecting the rest of China to Xinjiang was constructed in 1952, the Chinese immigrants began to flood the region,” he says. Accounts of relatives of those who’ve been detained have been emerging over the years. The systemic crackdown and cultural cleansing of the Uyghur people began much before the world took notice of it.   claims the 9/11 attacks in US gave China a handy reason to increase surveillance in the region, under the guise of “containing rising insurgency”. China has blamed the Muslim minority of forming separatist groups and fueling terrorism. “All the Uyghur youth born after 1980 are being thrown into prison or in concentration camps,” says Adil Cinar. Uyghurs are very different from the Han Chinese population – be it their clothing, cuisine, culture or, importantly, their religion. The Turkic-speaking community practices Islam and is more closely aligned with Uzbeks, Turkmans, Turks and Azarbaijani. China vehemently denies the existence of these detention centres and has warned the US to not intervene in the country’s “internal affairs”. “China consistently resolutely opposes the United States using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs,""   Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. On the other hand, Chinese authorities are warning Uyghurs as well as Han Chinese citizens residing in Xinjiang not to leak any “state secrets” to the outside world. There is a slogan in the city of Urumchi in Xinjiang, which says: “It is the legal obligation of every citizen to keep the secrets of the party and the country.” It remains nearly impossible to engage with Uyghurs living in Xinjiang, and it’s extremely difficult to report from the region. Many reports of foreign journalists being expelled due to their reportage on the ethnic minority’s cultural cleansing by the Chinese authorities have emerged. BuzzFeed reporter Megha Rajagopalan who has been reporting from China about Uyghurs says   after her visa could not be renewed due to some kind of a “process”. Everything about religion comes under the scanner in China. The government has invested billions in creating top-of-the-line surveillance technology in the region, which includes everything from facial recognition cameras at petrol stations to surveillance drones that patrol the border. “The Chinese police may break into any place at anytime in Xinjiang, even in the middle of the night they may came and search your house, so it is forbidden to lock the house from inside, if you resist they may execute you in your house,” says Adil Cinar. High-security detention centres and concentration camps have visibly grown in the region in one year, as per a report in  . “I believe they have already begun with the mass killings, the actual situation is much worse than what is being reported,” says Adil. The prisons are, predictably, not open to the citizens. Once taken away, it’s practically impossible to contact them or ask about the status of their release, and no formal document is provided by the authorities. In the “re-education camps”, Uyghurs are taught that religion is nonsensical, that the notion of ethnicity is not going to exist in the future, and the whole world is going to become “one nation”. Another eye-opening image from a Han Chinese classroom highlights China’s “plan” for future wars their country hopes to fight. Translation: In a video shared by  in April 2018, Rukiye Turdush sheds light on the heartbreaking condition of the Uyghur Muslim orphanage in Xinjiang where the children are forced to eat non-halal food, are kept away from their mothers, and remain under 24-hour Chinese control. A   on 30 August asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to impose sanctions on seven Chinese officials, including Chen Quanguo, the Communist party chief in Xinjiang, saying he had overseen the crackdown on Uyghur Muslims. US is attempting to limit American sales of surveillance technology that Chinese security agencies and companies are using to monitor Uyghurs throughout northwest China, the  reported. “But Muslim countries across the spectrum remain silent on the cultural cleansing of our people in Xinjiang for seven decades,” says  .

The Quint,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday, 20 September, accused Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of ""lying"" regarding Hindustan Aeronautics Limited’s (HAL) capability to build Rafale aircraft, and demanded her resignation, PTI reported. The Congress chief took to Twitter to attack Sitharaman, alleging that her position as the defence minister has become ‘untenable’ as a former HAL chief has ""nailed her lie"". The Congress has alleged that the government caused loss of over Rs 41,000 crore to the exchequer and endangered national security by bypassing the state-run HAL in favour of some businessmen ""friends"" for offset contract in the Rafale deal. Under India's offset policy, foreign defence entities are mandated to spend at least 30 percent of the total contract value in India through procurement of components or setting up of research and development facilities. On Tuesday, 18 September, Sitharaman alleged that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had failed to strengthen HAL for better bidding prices. “The entire issue of HAL not being chosen happened during their time. Every question should actually go to them. You (UPA) have not taken care of HAL. You have not made the terms appealing enough for HAL to bid it successfully with Dassault,” Sitharaman had said, referring to the former UPA regime. Sitharaman had earlier told PTI that it was former Defence Minister AK Antony's unprecedented intervention that led to the deal being cancelled after the price negotiation committee had almost finalised the deal. The charge has been denied by Antony. Sitharaman had also accused Antony of not supporting HAL in getting the Rafale deal. The Congress has stepped up the attack on the government over the Rafale deal, and is seeking to make it a major poll issue ahead of assembly elections in some key states later this year and the parliamentary election in 2019.

The Quint," Mohd. Ibrahim  Hera Khan, Shohini Bose As the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s lecture series   in Delhi concluded on Wednesday, 19 September, the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat batted for construction of the Ram Mandir at the earliest, for harmony among Hindu and Muslims, cow protection and Section 377. Talking at the conclave, Bhagwat said, “Hindutva is getting a great reception world across. It's (only) in India, (that a) hue and cry is made over it.” “Cow is a subject of traditional faith. Cow can become the base for rural ecosystem of small farmers. Cow is beneficial in many ways. Earlier, no one talked of Desi cow milk. But now they are,” Bhagwat said, adding that taking law in one's own hand, violence or destructing property, is totally inappropriate. “Due process of law should follow. The guilty should be punished,” he said. Here are the highlights from Bhagwat’s speech on the final day of the RSS event: Talking about Section 377, Bhagwat said that everybody is part of society and while some people are different, they are part of the same society. He also mentioned that with changing times, there is a need to ensure a healthy society. Bhagwat also said that the society needs to move ahead without a caste system. “Making it a reality will be tough, but we will make it happen. We don’t ask for caste in Sangh. As long as there is quota and reservation, we will continue to be divided along caste,” the RSS chief said. “Cow protectors shouldn’t be equated with those anti-social vigilantes. The society needs to be made aware. Only then, cows will be protected and the country will benefit,” he added. However, he said that the need for a person to learn his or her mother tongue, was paramount. “There is no need to be hostile towards any foreign language. We can learn other languages, but there’s a need for mother tongue education. For that, (we have to) make up our mind first, not the law. All Indian languages are ours. They all are great,” he said.

Nayantara Narayan,"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 popularly known as the Triple Talaq Bill, was introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha within a day. In the Lok Sabha, both at the stage of introduction and the stage of consideration, there were repeated demands for stakeholder consultation and reference to a Standing Committee. Pursuant to the declaration of triple talaq as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, it was incumbent upon the legislature to create a framework for the protection and empowerment of women. As per the government, a civil legislation would not suffice. There was a need to criminalise triple talaq because despite the Supreme Court judgement striking it down as unconstitutional, the practice continued. It seems to be the case of the government that the pronouncement of ‘talaq’ by a husband in an instantaneous manner amounts to arbitrary abandonment of his wife and must be treated as a cognisable and non-bailable offence.   Undoubtedly, the practice of triple talaq is derogatory to women and needs a legislative framework to protect their rights, but such a Bill should consider a civil remedy alongside criminal prosecution.   Indian society holds the institution of marriage as a sacrosanct union. Presently, the broad structure of all divorce laws in India is to: Irrespective of religion, the laws governing marriage and divorce have always focused on reconciliation of marriage as a priority. Under Hindu law, for example, even in case of an uncontested divorce where the husband and wife approach the court together seeking peaceful dissolution of marriage, the court provides a minimum of 6 months for reconsideration or reconciliation. Unlike other divorce laws in India, the focus here is on deterrence of the practice of triple talaq through criminalisation rather than the reconciliation of marriage. The Bill does not contain any provisions on any of the above listed aspects except for maintenance and custody. The Bill, in its present form, fails to provide clarity about the status of marriage during the pendency of such proceedings against the husband. If this is the case, then this Bill inadvertently legitimises the pronouncement of divorce through triple talaq. If this is not the case, the Bill is inept in dealing with the manner in which a divorce would be obtained – what are the options for the wife now that the husband is in jail?   A similar procedural irregularity exists in Hindu law in as much as the criminal offence of cruelty by the husband under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not automatically lead to initiation of divorce proceedings. Over the years the judiciary has come down on the provision in question and has highlighted the potential of its abuse. In fact, in 2017 itself the Supreme Court has issued guidelines to water down arrests under this provision. Having said that, it would be incorrect to assume that the Bill is unjustly favouring women. The Bill stipulates that once the words ‘talaq’ are uttered, it amounts to a cognisable and non-bailable offence. The Bill currently has not made corresponding changes in evidentiary law as a result of which it will be upon the married Muslim women to prove that the husband made a declaration of talaq and intended to follow through on it. This is likely to result in a low conviction rate. There is a need to consider provisions with regard to conciliation as such a provision would provide alternate remedies to Muslim women. Lastly, as of now, the fate of the Bill seems uncertain in the Rajya Sabha as a vote to refer it to a Select Committee is pending.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Saurav Datta,"The Modi government – undeterred in its quest to “rescue” Muslim women from the clutches of patriarchy – passed an ordinance on 19 September, to pave the way for criminalising the practice of triple talaq. The Ordinance makes triple talaq a non-bailable offence, that can lead to imprisonment of up to three years, upon conviction. But one must see how this action has opened up opposing factions among Muslim women’s rights groups. One must see how this ostensibly beneficial move is designed not to come to the aid of beleaguered Muslim women, but to target Muslim men. In sum, it is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. The Supreme Court’s judgment of August 2017 in the Shayara Bano case, which held the practice of talaq-e-biddat (or triple talaq) unconstitutional, was hailed by many as a step towards the emancipation of Muslim women and a win in the war against institutional remnants of gender inequality. In criminalising triple talaq, is the present government misusing a judgment delivered to promote gender equality, for ulterior motives? According to many in the Muslim women’s movement, the agenda is clear – to victimise Muslim men  of protecting Muslim women. A non-cognisable offence is an offence whereby the police cannot arrest a person without a warrant. Whereas, in cognisable offences, for serious crimes, the police may not have time to get a warrant and can arrest the accused immediately. Private wrongs are usually non-cognisable offences, such as bigamy. However, by making triple talaq a cognisable offence, the police can arrest Muslim men without any form of judicial oversight to determine whether a warrant should be issued, and the police can take a Muslim man into custody even if the wife does not file a complaint. Two critical questions arise at this juncture. First, is the Modi government right in passing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage ) Bill 2017 as an ordinance? All this, just because it could not ram it through the Rajya Sabha in the last parliament session, although, by sheer force of its numbers in the Lok Sabha, it could have it passed in the lower house? Second, what are the motivations behind this action? In January 2017, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court   that re-promulgation (or ordinances) is a fraud on the Constitution. While it is true that this is the first time this ordinance on married Muslim women’s rights is being promulgated and approved by the Cabinet, there is no escaping the fact that the government resorted to this step because it could not earn the consensus in parliament. With 2019 looming ahead, the ruling BJP and its allies are out on a limb to present themselves as ‘friends’ of the Muslims. Is this ordinance yet another move to present a moderate face to Muslims? And perhaps, a way to bypass parliamentary scrutiny? As legal scholar Gautam Bhatia  , taking the ordinance route is not exactly a step exuding probity and accountability. Hasina Khan of the Bebaaq Collective, which was one of the petitioners in the triple talaq case, severely criticised this move of the government. She said that by trying to bring in a supposed deterrence for Muslim men, some of whom were still indulging in the practice of triple talaq despite the apex court having outlawed it, this Hindutva- majority government was only trying to scare Muslim men into submission. “Muslim women want justice, and punitive measures are not justice. And by criminalising this practice and imposing a draconian prison term, this government is only revealing its intention of going after Muslim men,” she told  “The government’s ordinance does not care two hoots about how Muslim women, whose so called errant husbands would be facing a stiff prison term, would earn their sustenance for themselves or their children,” she continued. On the other hand, Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, told  that the government’s measure is a step in the right direction, although she and her organisation were disappointed because the amendments they suggested had not been incorporated. A specific legislation, even if it had some criminal provisions (although marriage and divorce and accompanying issues are governed by civil law in India) was the need of the hour to bring recalcitrant Muslim men into submission, she asserted. The BMMA had suggested that the government allow Muslim women to invoke Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and various provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, but this was ignored by the government, she rued. When asked about the opposition to the criminalisation of triple talaq, mostly by women’s groups who were her co-petitioners, she scoffed and said that they were being motivated by divisive political considerations, and asked where they were when innumerable Muslim women were suffering? It is thus clear that while some Muslim women do suffer from the practice of triple talaq, it is imprudent and hasty to call it a widespread malaise which can be curbed and eradicated by a criminal law. But the debate has only just begun, and perhaps a sincere reading of anthropologist Lila Abu Lughod’s essay “ ” would be beneficial to all sides.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ashutosh,"As an alumnus of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the violence and chaos that ensued in the wake of its student body elections, have left me both sad, and shocked. It used to never be this way. Irrespective of how bitter or heated elections were, they used to never turn violent. It is possible that JNU has changed in the last twenty years. It is also possible that its character might be entirely different now. But it is   possible that JNU has turned into a battle ground of sorts – that it resorts to guns and knives to solve a problem. It is hard to believe – and to wrap my head around this. But the incident that happened recently, is reality. According to reports, the threats have continued, even after the elections. It is also true that JNU has transformed into a fortress since 2014. Preparations are afoot to conquer it. There have been many attacks. And since everything is fair in war, as a first step to conquer JNU, efforts have been made to completely decimate its image. In 2016, a video curiously reached the so-called nationalist news channels, in which some audio going ‘  could be heard. It wasn’t long before TV media started calling the likes of Kanhaiya and Umar, members of the . This led to the emergence of the debate on Nationalism vs Treason, that is yet to be settled. Those who don’t agree with BJP-RSS ideology are now tagged as ‘anti-national’. Kanhaiya was jailed for 14 days on grounds of sedition in 2016, and was even assaulted by lawyers in Delhi’s Patiala House Court complex – even as the police silently watched. Interestingly, it has been over 900 days, but a chargesheet has yet to be filed against Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid. This, even as claims of ‘solid proof’ existing, continue to do the rounds. So, what happened? Was there no evidence or the whole thing was staged? This tussle, between the government and JNU, is an ideological one. RSS is not just an organisation, it is an ideological campaign that dreams of   the fabric of our country. It’s here that they are in direct conflict with the Left; at an ideological level. JNU is one of the last remaining bastions of Leftist thought. The RSS knows only too well, that for its ideological domination, the Left (ideology) has to be defeated. Perhaps I have had to suffer because of this habit of questioning and fearlessly speaking my mind. But it has also taught me that where there is democracy, there will be debate and the spirit of inquiry. Today in JNU, amidst the efforts to establish a new ideology and root out the old one, this culture has all but vanished. The way Kanhaiya Kumar has recently been attacked in the name of nationalism, is an attempt to bury that culture of inquiry. Despite not being a Communist, I have no hesitation in saying that it is because of Communism that JNU has become one of India’s premier educational institutions. Even today I am proud to call JNU my alma mater. But the RSS student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, has wreaked havoc on campus. The RSS has done all this consciously. The logic is clear: ‘if we can’t win the students’ votes, we can definitely defame them’. This propaganda is effective. JNU is being punished for not adopting Hindutva; punished for being friends with the Left. It is worth noting that in the past four and a half years, the RSS has not been able to establish even one such educational institution of JNU’s stature. I even put this question to a senior RSS leader. But to this, the RSS has no answer. (   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Located at a prime hub in the city, the park is spread across a sprawling area of 1.3 acres. It boasts of an exclusive play area for dogs, training and play equipment, an amphitheatre, a separate enclosure for small and big dogs, and benches shaped like bones for the owners to relax. It is reportedly the first park in India to be developed to match international standards for pets, and to be certified by the Kennel Club of India. What was earlier a small dump yard was later converted into the park at a cost of Rs 1.1 crore. Municipal and Urban Administration minister KT Rama Rao posted about the park on Twitter. The pet park is supposedly the brainchild of IAS officer Harichandana, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Zonal Commissioner, who developed it on the lines of pet parks which are common abroad. The park also has provisions for persons with disabilities and their dog helpers to exercise and enjoy outdoor activities without the fear of accidents.

Alison Saldanha,"During the winter session, the Triple Talaq Bill or the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill was extensively debated in Parliament, with the proposed legislation now stalled in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament). In its   to push through the Triple Talaq Bill, the government appears to have overlooked five criminal laws relating to women and marriage identified in 2015 by a government committee as needing immediate political attention. These are: The bill seeks to turn the practice of talaq-e-biddat, or instant triple talaq, which allows a Muslim man to divorce his wife by uttering the word talaq three times in quick succession, into a “cognisable and non-bailable offence”. It proposes a prison term that “may extend to three years” and a fine for Muslim men who are guilty of instant triple talaq. This law also provides for subsistence allowance to affected women and custody of minor children as “determined by the magistrate”. It pushes Muslim women into incarcerating their husbands. What is frightening is that it gives power to a third person to file a criminal charge. How will this sword of criminalisation be used in the current atmosphere where anti-minority feelings are heightened?” said this  in the  . A ban on triple talaq had been recommended by the high-level committee in its four-volume   on the status of women in India. The committee did not specify if the practice should be criminalised. The expert committee, formed in 2013 – 25 years after the last such panel – submitted the report to the Ministry of Women and Child Development after “two years of poring over data and reports, widespread consultations, intense and insightful meetings, independent research and more importantly many hours of listening to women in the field”. In volume two of the study, the panel recommended several measures to ameliorate the status of women across communities, in fields relating to the economy, environment and law. In its assessment of women and criminal law, the committee lists several recommendations, not restricted to Muslim personal laws alone, to help women through legislation and the justice system. Less than a handful of these recommendations have been initiated. “Though there have been a number of legislative enactments, gender-based violence and discrimination continue. There are clearly lacunae in the laws and also gaps in their implementation.” Currently, there is no legal recourse for victims of marital rape as section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, provides an exception to marital rape. “The exemption of marital rape stems from a long outdated notion of marriage which regarded wives as no more than the property of their husbands,” the high-level committee report observed. Recalling several previous recommendations to the government, the committee once again recommended the exception now be removed to make marital rape an offence irrespective of the wife’s age. “The relationship between the perpetrator and the victim should be irrelevant in evaluating consent,” the report said. Supreme Court advocate Karuna Nundy, an expert on constitutional law who has argued for criminalising marital rape, pointed out that cases of marital rape may be filed under section 498-A of the IPC relating to ‘cruelty by husband and his relatives’. Under section 498-A of the IPC, which refers to ‘cruelty by husband or relatives of husband’, the law seeks to punish the husband or his family for harassing a woman to the point of driving her to suicide or for coercing her or any person related to her to meet unlawful demands. If found guilty, the accused can be jailed for a term extending to three years or be fined. Over a third, or 34% (110,378 cases) of 325,652 serious crimes against women reported in 2016, were filed under section 498-A, showed National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)  for 2016, the latest available. This was the most among all categories of crimes against women reported that year. The committee report has recommended that the definition of cruelty be reviewed to include “the varied forms of violence against women in the home and to ensure that it is in line with the definition of “domestic violence” given under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005”. As many as 31% of ever-married Indian women have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional spousal violence, according to the National Family Health Survey, 2015-16,  . The most common type of spousal violence is physical violence (27%), followed by emotional violence (13%), while 6% of ever-married women have experienced spousal sexual violence. Currently, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, prohibits the giving or taking of dowry. An offender is subject to a minimum of five years’ imprisonment. The law requires those getting married to make a list of gifts and presents. The committee report reiterated the amendments to the anti-dowry law proposed by the National Commission for Women (NCW) – widen the definition of dowry and lower the penalty levied on the giver of dowry. It recommended that   (all the movable, immovable property, gifts and so on a woman receives in her lifetime) be included in the definition of dowry; and also that the legal provisions that allow a husband to inherit this   be deleted. However, in July 2017, the Supreme Court of India struck down the use of section 498-A in dowry cases, putting an end to the immediate arrest of the husband and his family in dowry cases. The court’s decision was based on the high acquittal rate in dowry cases reported under section 498-A – a median 81% over the decade to 2015, according to this    from 3 August 2017. However, for a decade from 2005 to 2015, 88,467 women, or an average of 22 each day, died in dowry-related cases, indicating how little has changed despite the existence of an anti-dowry law for nearly six decades, the report said. “While the launch of campaigns such as   and debates around dowry reflect concern on the issue of sex-selective abortion, the declining sex ratio and dowry death, there seems to be more concern about the unborn and the dead and a lack of thrust in securing the rights of the women who are alive and facing violence,” said the committee, with reference to the changing institutional stance on section 498-A. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act of 2006 outlaws the solemnisation of child marriages where the a boy is under 21 years of age or the girl under 18. Underage marriages, especially of girls, are rising in urban India and declining in rural India, according to this IndiaSpend   from 9 June 2017. “Unequal economic, social and political status and position of women is an outcome of patriarchy and the deeply entrenched socio-cultural stereotypes about women. This is sometimes perpetuated by laws, regulations and policies which do not sufficiently address the subordinate status of women,” the report said. Honour killing [a crime wherein a member of a family is murdered, due to the perpetrators’ belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family] is not just a way of punishing the one who has brought dishonour to the family, it is indeed a barbaric murder usually of girls, report said. To address the high rate of such killings and their gender skew, the committee recommended a separate legislation, previously recommended by the NCW and other women’s organisations. This would involve the shifting of criminal consequences of the extra-judicial honour killings on the khap panchayats that order them. “Honour crimes and khap diktats have received widespread media coverage and incited social and judicial outrage,” the panel noted. “However, they form a major lacuna in the law and poses a complexity that the IPC is unable to address.” “Violence against women has been acknowledged as one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men and therefore a violation of women’s equality rights,” the report said. “Passing legislation however does not indicate judicial or executive sensitivity to women’s rights. Faithful implementation of the laws is thus the essence for good governance.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Raghav Bahl," Mohd Ibrahim and Vivek Gupta Anubhav Mishra  Abhay Sharma The University of Delhi (DU) immeasurably helped create Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political brand. His sprint towards the stunning 2014 victory had begun on 6 February 2013 at  . The auditorium was packed with students eager to listen to his sermon on the Gujarat model of development. A bevy of television channels were going live across the country, to an audience of hundreds of millions of curious viewers. The Gujarat Chief Minister was very nervous about this outing. Why? Because Modi had a complex about his lack of facility in English; he feared being mocked by DU’s hip and elite students. Yet he spoke passionately in Hindi for 75 minutes. His rousing speech was peppered with words that were to become his trademark through that extraordinary campaign:   (20 times);   (16);   (15);   (12);     (180)! Two thousand students sprung to their feet in a standing ovation that seemed to last forever, resonating across the country. Modi himself was astonished at the applause. Then it came to him in a flash. He could win the following year, riding on the mantra of hope, youth, aspiration, development, more development, and even more development; it was irrelevant to his constituency whether he spoke in Hindi or English. There are four other reasons why DU, and what happens on that campus, is crucial for Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): Given the above reasoning, it’s irrefutable that vote shares thrown up in DUSU elections should give vital clues about the national political mood. I also concede that psephologically, these polls do not make for a scientific sample; so, it would be foolish to project the NDA’s or UPA’s gains or losses from these numbers. But can you glean some tangible insights into the upcoming 2019 battle? You bet! Here are the key data pointers from the DUSU polls: Now to the next critical question: Does the DUSU data sync up with other inputs? Does it violate or validate what other credible sources are throwing up? Because if it does validate, then our inferences would have a stronger ring of truth, right? Let me recall the significant crunching we had done on by-elections held after the Gujarat polls of December 2017. This by-election data is “circumstantially random”, since no systematic bias gets created when legislators die or resign. Here, then, are the contours of our “real world sample” of ten parliamentary and 21 Assembly by-elections, spread over 15 states, in which over 1.25 crore people cast their votes for nearly 19 political parties:   There is an almost perfect overlap between the DUSU poll numbers and the by-elections’ real voting data: We can now say, with a huge amount of confidence, that vote shares across the country are hardening at 36 percent for NDA, 32 percent for UPA, 14 percent for potentially anti-BJP regional parties, and 18 percent for the rest. But wait. Whenever I have done the above analysis, I have been energetically accosted by pro-Modi experts for ignoring a crucial variable (or imponderable):  . They argue, quite justifiably, that all this data was gathered when      . They assert, again justifiably, that he has a “delta” in which    , not for the BJP or RSS or any other factor. I readily concede this argument. There is a “peak Modi” phenomenon, that is, if Modi is in the fray, they would vote for him, irrespective of whether they had voted for non-BJP outfits in other elections. Now, is there a way we can estimate “peak Modi”? Yes, there is: In the ultimate analysis then, we could be looking at the following score: So, who will win? Go figure.

Anthony Rozario,"Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has been keeping unwell since February 2018 and his prolonged absence from the state has reportedly led to a power struggle within the alliance that he glued together. A former defence minister, Parrikar is admitted to Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where he is undergoing treatment for pancreatic ailment. According to reports, Parrikar had initially expressed his inability to discharge his duties, following which rumours of Sudin Dhavlikar – one of the three MLAs from ally Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party (MGP) – taking over as deputy chief minister filled Goa’s political circles. But that proposal has been opposed by ally Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the three independent MLAs supporting the BJP-led government. An   suggests that BJP President Amit Shah had dialled GFP president Vijay Sardesai after several members rejected Dhavlikar’s elevation. Sensing that the situation may go out of hand, the BJP’s central leadership had sent three observers to the state, following which the party is considering reappointing a Cabinet Advisory Committee (CAC), reports the  . The CAC, if reappointed, will empower a number of ministers to approve expenditure proposals on CM Parrikar’s behalf. But so far there’s been no clarity on a second-line of leadership in Parrikar’s absence. The Congress had won 17 seats (the party later lost one seat after Vishwajeet Rane resigned and won on a BJP ticket) in 2017 but was prevented from forming the government as it failed to bring other parties on board while the BJP acted right under its nose. It has urged the Governor to not dissolve the Assembly and allow it to form the government while challenging Parrikar to prove majority in the House. Although the Congress says it is in touch with other MLAs, all coalition members have said they are with the BJP and won’t break away from the alliance. The lone NCP lawmaker Churchill Alemao had previously voted for the BJP during the trust vote in March 2017, but now says that he will support the Congress, reported  But politics is the art of the impossible and here’s what could happen in Goa. The BJP-led alliance in Goa has 22 members – excluding the Speaker who can’t vote unless there’s a tie – out of which three party members are ill, reports the  . Apart from Parrikar, Urban Development Minister Francis D’souza is being treated for a kidney ailment in the United States and Minister of Power Pandurang Madkaikar has been hospitalised ever since he suffered a stroke. In the event of a floor test, even if these three ailing lawmakers aren’t able to vote and the allies stay together, the BJP will win. The BJP will be left with 19 MLAs, one short of the halfway mark, but two more than the Congress’ 17 (one from NCP.) Even if one of the three independent candidates side with the Congress, increasing its tally to 18 and the three ailing BJP lawmakers don’t vote, the BJP-led coalition will be left with 18 MLAs, bringing it to a tie with the Congress. In the event of a tie, the Speaker of the Assembly can cast his vote. If the Speaker casts his vote in favour of the BJP-led coalition, the BJP will stand at 19, one seat more than the Congress. If in the same scenario, the three ailing BJP lawmakers vote, the BJP will secure 21 votes, and sail through the trust vote. If the three ailing BJP MLAs don’t vote, the BJP’s numbers will be reduced to 19 (22-3=19). Further, if three independents, or either of the three MLAs from the MGP or the GFP split with BJP and side with the Congress, the BJP will be reduced to 16 and the Congress will increase its tally to 20, reaching the halfway mark. In such a scenario, even if the three ailing BJP lawmakers vote, the BJP will only be able to manage 19 votes and will lose hold over Goa. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TS Sudhir,"A poster of Uttam Kumar Reddy in his Indian Air Force uniform with a fighter jet in the backdrop welcomes you at the entrance to Gandhi Bhavan, the headquarters of the Telangana unit of the Congress party in Hyderabad. The headline reads ‘Our Captain’, almost as if to underline that Reddy, the president of the Telangana Congress, brings a no-nonsense and disciplined approach to the cesspool of party politics in the state. Inside his office, the man looks nowhere like the officer on the poster. Reddy, who now sports a thick beard, quit the IAF in 1994 after 13 years of flying MIG-21 and MIG-23 over Tezpur, the Western sector and being involved in skirmishes over Siachen. His thick facial hair owes its existence to a vow that Reddy took about four years ago, that he will not shave until the Congress comes to power in Telangana. Reddy's visit to the barber now is subject to the Telangana voter's nod. Uttam Kumar Reddy has the toughest job in Telangana politics right now. Far tougher than flying a fighter jet, he insists. With K Chandrasekhar Rao dissolving the assembly eight months ahead of schedule, Reddy has to ensure a united opposition can put it past the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). “Vote transfer will take place because over several issues in the last four years, the parties have been fighting together. The cadres are prepared for it. In fact, on our ‘Shakti’ app, we did a poll to ask 1.5 lakh Congress cadre, and the response from them was that we should go in for an alliance,” says Reddy. Within Congress circles, leaders are aware of the TRS strategy to make it a  match. The TRS chief can be a powerful and entertaining orator, given to delivering political punches in Telangana slang. He revels in rubbishing his opponents, as if to convey that he considers them worthless of being competitors. Reddy therefore is banking on arithmetic to beat the chemistry that KCR enjoys with the voter. Which is why the Congress-led alliance is harping on allegations of corruption in developmental projects, and how KCR has been unable to get the NDA government to deliver on promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act. “This is going to be the end of KCR rule. Family rule will end,” he insists. It has not been easy for Uttam Reddy in the hot seat, given that the Telangana Congress comes with the reputation of being a divided house, with mega egos to take care of. In the initial years after he was appointed in 2015, his rivals within the party spared no effort to get him removed. But Reddy has shown the tenacity of a soldier, and his ability to lead has been tested. The disparaging joke about the Congress is that it has as many as 31 chief ministerial candidates, one from each district. “This is media overplay,” says Reddy. “Who will be CM, will be decided by Rahul Gandhi. Higher number of aspirants shows the strength and the capabilities of the party.” Another worry is that all the hard work put in by Reddy and Co could be undone by the Trojan horses who may be KCR's men and women within the Congress. This is a concern expressed by many senior leaders in private conversations. “That problem existed. But those Trojan horses have left the party now,” he says with the confidence of a military man who understands how the best plans can come undone with a Brutus in the camp. Reddy is often at the receiving end of barbs from his rivals, both within the party and outside, alluding to the 2014 election when cash worth Rs 1.5 lakh was found burnt in his car bonnet. The allegation of corruption has since been thrown at Reddy to corner him. More recently, a tweet from his handle where he referred to KCR's son, IT Minister KT Rama Rao's days in the US as a “dishwasher” smacked of a class bias. Reddy's defence is that he wanted to convey that KTR was an upstart who had made a lateral entry into his party, but his team did not word the tweet properly. In 2016, Reddy played the role of chief minister in a Telugu movie   which disappeared without a trace, from the box office. Reddy laughs aloud when reminded of his experience donning greasepaint. “A filmmaker friend was short of funds and I was free. That's how I landed the role,” says Reddy. The reel disaster notwithstanding, Reddy would hope he would get the chance in real life, where he can put his experience of flying high to good use.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

She added that she was informed of the attack, at 4 am on Monday, 17 September morning. She added that the ABVP had apologised in full to the reporter in question, and said that Saurabh Sharma was “under a lot of mental stress” and was “very emotional” at the time, and perhaps that was why he made the ‘afzalgiri’ statement.

Madhav Nakra,"Vijay Mallya may have been in the news for all the wrong reasons, but he sure has (inadvertently) done one good deed – bringing the issue of back into the limelight. “ ”   the Supreme Court of India in 1980. Since then, it is quite alarming to observe, that despite making much progress as a society, we have continued to ignore the issue of prison reforms. Prisons are a   in India, which means that their administration and control fall under the respective state governments, who are at liberty to make rules and regulations. Over the course of several years, numerous  , committees and guidelines have been formed, but structural changes in prisons largely remain insignificant in political discourse. As per the data on  , 67.2 percent of prisoners in India are still at the undertrial stage. The presumption of innocence is a well-accepted norm and a deep-rooted principle in the Indian criminal system. However, due to the exceedingly long investigation process and prolonged court orders, innocent individuals end up languishing in jail. This has an unfavourable domino effect on the condition of prisons including staffing, facilities and management, resulting in an adverse impact on the mental and physical state of prisoners. To rectify the issue of undertrials, the Criminal Procedure Code through   provides that undertrials who have served half the maximum sentence of the offence committed, are eligible to be released on personal bond, with or without surety. However, with little or no implementation and supervision, the situation has deteriorated to an extent that the Supreme Court has   (as recently as 2018) that overcrowding in jails is well above 100 percent, and in some cases, even exceeds 150 percent. To put forward the argument of “why should prisoners receive basic facilities when the general public is not well off themselves?” or “prisoners don’t deserve resources because they are hardened criminals” paints a dismal view of India’s progression towards being a welfare state. After all, the state has a   towards the preservation of life of its citizens, whether behind bars or not, under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Further, the majority of inmates are illiterate or have only studied up to Class 10. This phenomenon arises either because the Indian judicial system is inherently biased, in recognising that disadvantaged sections are pushed into petty crimes, or due to the lack of adequate legal representation and financial resources. Ultimately, this outcome is unacceptable under the directive principle  , albeit a non-binding one, which provides for the state to strive for equal opportunity and free legal aid for all. The link between the purpose of prison, and theories of punishment, is again a great cause of confusion. On numerous occasions, courts have come forward to   that the Indian criminal system is based on a reformatory and rehabilitative approach. However, the ground situation emphasises the opposite: a strong inclination towards retribution and deterrence. This is because we as a society want these criminals to be ‘punished’ and to feel ‘pain’ in the conventional sense. The social theory behind ‘eye for an eye’ is further strengthened by the legislative approach in  the death penalty and harsher punishments for certain offences. Certain rebalancing and changes in the prison structure are desperately needed; both literally and figuratively. The voice of   inmates cannot be stifled due to the sole reason that they are the ‘bad people’ (which in the majority of cases is yet to even be proved). Thus, challenging the status quo becomes real, desperate and ever so required. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Akshat Tyagi,"After the ‘missed’ adventure of   last year, Sadhguru is back, with yet another mission to save the nation. But unlike the last time when some   did the tricky math that revealed that his rally’s carbon footprint alone was the equivalent of 8 lakh trees, this time, it will be difficult to do the cost-benefit calculus of his new ‘The Youth & Truth’ endeavour. Sadhguru is visiting educational institutions in the country to directly interact with the youth. At the end of his tour, he wants to use these inputs to even draft  Starting with Delhi’s Shri Ram College of Commerce on 4 September, Sadhguru is set to travel to pretty much all the renowned institutions of higher learning in the country— IIM-Bangalore, NALSAR, IIT-Bombay, JNU, IIM-Ahmedabad, BHU, among others. Some students of NALSAR even received an email about Sadhguru wanting an 'adversarial debate' on the theme of 'One Nation, One Election'. This is what the email says, as provided by a NALSAR student (on condition of anonymity): This news is cause for alarm. But before we discuss the question of ‘free speech’ in public institutions, what makes Sadhguru such a controversial figure? Unlike many other ‘godmen’, Sadhguru doesn’t rely on the devotion of his followers; he thrives on successful commercial enterprises built around the unholy marriage of science and spirituality. He doesn’t challenge the human senses or rationality; he claims to be ‘beyond them.’ He is not anti-science, but ‘meta-science.’ In one of his blogs on the Isha Foundation website, Sadhguru constructs a link between food poisoning and a lunar eclipse. “Certain things happen in the planet where anything that has moved away from its natural condition will deteriorate very fast. This is why, while there is no change in raw fruits and vegetables, there is a distinct change in the way cooked food is, before and after the eclipse. What was nourishing food turns into poison.” Sadhguru’s callous statement on mob lynchings, in which he claimed  , and rather, it is because of ‘growing paranoia about child kidnappings and cattle stealing’, has been condemned by many. His organisation’s understanding of the cause of depression, as revealed through the tweet below, shows both ignorance and apathy. Worse still, Sadhguru’s theories on  are an affront to all cancer research. This isn’t a question of free speech at all. If you have personal resources to invite someone for a backyard concert on junk science, it is solely your business. But for reputed institutions of higher learning to invite such a figure to propagate his views, that too, “to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform,” may not be a responsible move. These, in my opinion, are misguided suggestions from liberals. Choosing to accommodate a perspective even when you disagree with it, is to endorse its intellectual validity over a million others. It is a statement of agreement to the other person’s allegiance to truth, if not other values. Having said that, it is unlikely that an institution will ever invite Zakir Naik (or Radhe Maa). Before inviting a mystic or godman to an educational institution, we seriously need to look into the said person’s background, qualifications, previous work /statements, lest it devolve into a situation that occurred in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha in 2016, when a Jain monk in the nude was invited to deliver his  But Sadhguru’s wardrobe, and success in business, don’t qualify him for exemption.

The Quint,"Alleging that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government failed to strengthen Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for better bidding prices, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave her rebuttal on Tuesday, 18 September, in Delhi. “The entire issue of HAL not being chosen happened during their time. Every question should actually go to them. You (UPA) have not taken care of HAL. You have not made the terms appealing enough for HAL to bid it successfully with Dassault,” Sitharaman said, referring to the former UPA regime. The minister also said the accountability for sidelining the interests of HAL, a state-owned aerospace, lies with the previous governments, and not with the present one. Congress President Rahul Gandhi had also accused the Modi government of tailoring the Rafale deal to benefit “one businessman”, by sealing the deal at a much higher price than the UPA government had fixed during negotiation. The allegations referred to the joint agreement between Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group and French Company Dassault for supplying 36 fighter jets. Sitharaman was addressing a press conference at the Indian Women’s Press Corps. She was responding to the accusations made by former Defence Minister A K Antony earlier on Tuesday afternoon, on shying away from setting up a joint parliamentary committee to probe the Rafale deal. “The Rafale deal didn't happen during UPA. What also didn't happen during UPA was, that between HAL and Dassault, they couldn't agree on production terms. So HAL and Rafale couldn't go together. Doesn't that very clearly say who didn't go together with HAL, under which government did that happen,” Sitharaman asked, adding that Antony should understand the process. Sitharaman also alleged that it was the previous government which didn’t take care of the interests of HAL and the Indian Air Force. “Isn’t it obvious that the interest of HAL could have been taken care of at that time? Neither HAL’s interests nor Indian Air Force’s interest were taken care of by the UPA government,” she said. “If the agreement between Dassault and HAL did not happen, the facts are before us. What we have done after coming into talking with Dassault, with PM going in 2015 and signing agreement in 2016, has been for an intergovernmental based procurement of 36 aircrafts in ready-to-fly condition,” the minister said. Sitharaman also criticised Navjot Singh Sidhu’s hug with Pakistan’s army chief on Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony in Pakistan, calling it “demoralising”. “It certainly has an impact on soldiers and the people in ministry. Public response has been similar that it demoralises. If it demoralises people, I wish Sidhu would have avoided,” the Union minister said. “I'm not talking about him going, but that single gesture of hugging the chief of Pakistan’s Army,” she said, adding that “we have clear feelings regarding the army chief.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Meghnad Bose,"On Sunday afternoon, at the end of a controversy-marred counting process, Left Unity candidate N Sai Balaji sat on the shoulders of his fellow comrades, flag in hand and ‘lal salaam’ on his lips. The Left had swept the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) elections yet another year, with Balaji set to become its next president. But even as Balaji and his mates celebrated their election to the JNUSU – the university’s bastion of resistance against the administration – they would have been grateful for a decision taken by their predecessors in the Left a couple of years ago. Specifically, in the year that JNU students were arrested on charges of sedition and the university was labelled “anti-national” by ministers, anchors and trolls. On 13 September 2015, Kanhaiya Kumar, easily the most recognisable JNUSU president in recent times, was elevated to the top post in Jawaharlal Nehru University’s student body after a tightly-fought race. Kanhaiya, representing the CPI’s student body AISF, had edged past fellow Left organisation AISA’s Vijay Kumar by a slender margin of 67 votes. But over the (dramatic) course of his tenure, Kanhaiya would realise that his biggest adversary did not lie within the Left. From ministers in the Modi government, to a Delhi Police bent on acting against him, his primary opponents operated from outside the walls of the university. Even within JNU, it was the ideologically opposed ABVP that proved to be his nemesis more than election rival AISA. Sandeep Mahapatra, ABVP’s first and only JNUSU President, had been elected to the post in 2000-2001. The Left was under attack, the government was labelling their leaders as “anti-nationals”, primetime news anchors were screaming their condemnations at JNUSU office-bearers Kanhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid, and amongst it all, the ABVP was gaining momentum in its campaign against the longtime dominance of the AISF, AISA and SFI. In 2015, when Kanhaiya Kumar and Vijay Kumar fought it out and came in first and second position respectively, the ABVP was still quite a distance away, not really threatening to dominate or overtake the Left, yet. But given the propaganda campaign underway against the Left, the AISA and SFI joined hands for the 2016 JNUSU polls. But it was that   that effectively countered the ABVP’s rapid momentum, numerically and ideologically. From the solitary seat that the ABVP won in 2015, they were back to a clean slate in 2016. Speaking to  after the 2017 JNUSU results, Nidhi Tripathi, that year’s ABVP presidential candidate argued, Numerically, Tripathi is not entirely off the mark. Yet politically, she knows that isn’t enough. The Left had successfully staved off the threat from the ABVP, and swept the JNUSU polls clean. That’s all that mattered. Votes polled in 2017 (vote share in brackets): Votes polled in 2018 (vote share in brackets): Observe the numbers carefully. That   and not hindsight saves the day, and the pragmatic approach of “coming together despite differences to not let the ideological adversary win” may seem like a pain to deal with, but is one that is eventually likely to bear fruit.

Salai Varun,"The United Nations’ World Social Justice Day falls on 20 February. A cursory look at the newspapers since 1 February whilst sipping a cup of coffee would wrench our hearts. Here are a few headlines to illustrate my point: For a Tamizhian, it is indeed an uncanny coincidence that World Social Justice Day and International Mother Language Day fall simultaneously. At this happenstance, one ought not forget the ‘Prophet of the New Age,’ the ‘Socrates’ of South East Asia, Father of the Social Reform Movement, and arch enemy of ignorance, superstitions, meaningless customs, and base manners – EV Ramassamy aka Periyar. Periyar waged an ideological war against social injustice and against imposition of an ‘alien language’ in Tamil Nadu. This supreme proponent of political rationality advocated that the crusade against social inequality and against ill-founded imposition of Hindi went hand-in-glove. Whether his contention is correct or not is a never-ending debate. However, it leaves no room for doubt that “imposition” and “anti-egalitarian attitude” are seldom desirable. Periyar’s condemnation of caste-atrocities, vilification of religious hegemony and social dogmas are well-known. One may have to write volumes depicting his glory on implanting rationalism in the Tamil soil that was once infected by baneful practices. He also battled against the practice of untouchability. A noteworthy event was the Vaikom Satyagraha. In 1924, when Vaikom in Kerala was chosen for Satyagraha, Periyar and his wife, Nagamma, led the struggle for the right of all castes to enter the temple. He was imprisoned for participation. Although the ‘satyagraha’ was withdrawn, he was baptised as the “Vaikom Veera” – or the hero of Vaikom. The patriarchal perspective confined women to households; Periyar’s articulation on feminism broke chains of orthodoxy. He valiantly spoke of a woman’s right to marriage and a woman’s right to bear a child of her own accord, uncontrolled by men. He propagated that upbringing of girls should be in no way different from the upbringing of boys. Prominently, he advocated widow remarriage. Moreover, the Dravidians spoke of family planning way back in the 1930s casting away the notion that children were gifts of God. The Dravidians, led by Periyar, protested against the imposition of Hindi on non-speakers. In 1950, Hindi was made the official language of India ignoring all the other languages. Students played the most active role reprehending the Hindi imposition. The people’s movement turned ugly as police opened fire on unarmed students in Annamalai University. It is pertinent to mention that this excruciating movement against imposition of Hindi entailed self-immolation by martyrs. In 1967, the Congress faced an ignominious defeat in the state elections forcing to amend the said Act to a “virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism.” It has been 100 years since the Justice Party was started and almost 45 years have passed since Periyar’s demise, and 40 years since the Official Languages Act was amended — but social injustice and language imposition remains alive.

Akanksha Kumar,"Abhishek Sharma & Ashutosh Bhardwaj For Pankaj Meshram, a resident of Amravati in Maharashtra, the word ‘Dalit’ is insulting. His discomfiture with the nomenclature led him to file a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. It’s the Bombay High Court’s judgment in Meshram’s case that has triggered a debate across the country, whether the word ‘Dalit’ is an appropriate term for an entire community that has been victimised by violence and caste tensions for years. In its order dated 6 June 2018, the Nagpur bench of the high court said: In March 2018, the Union Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment had issued instructions, making usage of 'Scheduled Caste' mandatory in all official communication. Following the HC’s order, the Information & Broadcasting Ministry, issued an advisory to private news channels. In a letter dated 7 August 2018, the ministry said that “media may refrain from using the nomenclature “Dalit” while referring to members belonging to Scheduled Caste”. It’s, however, not clear whether this advisory is binding on news outlets. Since the letter was addressed to news channels, one can only guess whether the advisory is applicable to print and digital media. For Meshram, it was the Khairlanji massacre of 2006 that compelled him to take up this cause. On 29 September 2006, four members of a family were allegedly killed by the upper caste Kunbis, sparking outrage. Meshram’s lawyer Shailesh Narnavare says the word ‘Dalit’ is ‘illegal’. However, many activists don’t agree with the duo. For them the word ‘Dalit’ is associated with the struggles and the unique identity of the community. According to scholar and activist Anand Teltumbde, even the father of India’s Constitution, Dr BR Ambedkar was never averse to the term ‘Dalit’. In a telephonic conversation with  , Teltumbde quoted example of the newspaper started by Ambedkar in the 1930s which used the term ‘Dalit’ frequently.

Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale has announced that his party will challenge the ministry’s advisory in Supreme Court. Athawale says that most Dalit groups do not have a problem with the term ‘Dalit’, which gives them a sense of pride.

Bhagwat also asserted that RSS is the “most democratic” and not dictatorial, insisting that it neither imposes its ideology nor remote-controls its various affiliates, apparently rejecting criticism that the BJP is controlled by it. Addressing a gathering of BJP leaders, union ministers, Bollywood actors, artists and academicians, Bhagwat also said India's diversity must be respected, celebrated and it should not be a reason for any discord in society as he extensively talked about evolution of the nearly nine-decade old RSS and its vision for an inclusive India. Bhagwat insisted that ""Hindutva binds us together and our vision of Hindutva is not to oppose or demean anyone"". Bhagwat, who also extensively quoted RSS founder K B Hedgewar in his speech, said the event was being organised so that people could understand the organisation.

Senior functionaries of the RSS said a list of about 500 dignitaries was being prepared for the event.

Mayawati said, “People of the country know that the campaign undertaken by the BJP and the RSS in the name of Vajpayee is an attempt to hide failures. The BJP will not benefit from this. The people of the country now understand that none of the election promises made in 2014 Lok Sabha elections was fulfilled.” Terming mob lynchings in the name of cow protection ( ) as a “blot on democracy”, Mayawati accused the BJP state governments of being lax on the issue. “The increasing tendency of indulging in mob lynching in the name of cow protection in BJP-ruled states is a blot on democracy, yet the governments are exercising laxity and are being indifferent to it,” she said. “These activities of the BJP governments (against the Dalits, tribals, backwards, Muslims and Christians) are going on from their inception and have assumed alarming proportions after they came to power,” she said, alleging the BJP after forming the government was trying to crush democratic movements. In a virtual snub to Chandrashekhar Azad, Mayawati denied reports of any association with the Bhim Army chief, days after he claimed that he and his “bua” (aunt) Mayawati have the “same blood”. “Some people in order to realise their vested political interests, some in their defence, while some to look young are trying to forge different relationships such as brother-sister and bua-bhatija (aunt and nephew) with me,” she said. Her comments came against the backdrop of the Bhim Army founder, who is also known as Ravan, reportedly claimed that, “We (he and Mayawati) both have the same blood. She may have some issues with me, I have none with her. It is not in my values to speak ill of my 'bua' (aunt). Our only aim is to defeat the BJP.” Referring to attempts made by Chandrashekhar to forge the relationship of ‘bua’ with her, Mayawati said she cannot have any “respectable relationship with these people”. Mayawati claimed the Centre was not able to come clean on the Rafale deal. Referring to demonetisation, Mayawati said, ""It was done in an unplanned manner leading to a financial emergency. It exploited the labourers, farmers, small traders and hardworking people and took the lives of over 100 persons. The BJP government should now at least tender an apology over the national tragedy."" On the possibility of misuse of SC/ST Act, Mayawati said, ""The BSP is of the view that if the current state governments follow the 'Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay' policy of her party, then there will be no misuse of this law."" The BJP on Sunday sought to know from whom BSP chief Mayawati was expecting ‘respect’ vis-a-vis her statement that her party will ally with any group as long as BSP gets “respectable share of seats”. “Is she expecting respect from those who had shattered her pride and dignity in the infamous 1995 Guest House case?,” asked media coordinator of Uttar Pradesh BJP Rakesh Tripathi. Recalling the more than two-decade-old incident, Tripathi said it was BJP MLA Brahm Dutt Dwivedi who came to Mayawati's rescue. “Today Mayawati is expecting respect from those, who had shown scant respect to her in the past. This shows how nervous she is and that her voter base has eroded,” Tripathi said. On the BSP chief's statement that BJP is not leaving any stone unturned to derive mileage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP media coordinator said, ""Mayawati has honoured so many great and eminent personalities by constructing their statues in Lucknow. I fail to understand why is she having any problem if the BJP is holding various programmes in honour and memory of Atalji."" Tripathi said, “Mayawati has been treating Dalits as her vote bank. The BJP on the other hand has worked to increase the bank balance of the Dalits. She is visualising that her bank is being virtually robbed. Hence she is worried.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday, 16 September said the Mahagathbandhan's only agenda was to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power. Calling the grand alliance a 'dhakosla' (deception), Shah urged the voters to understand that the parties who were a part of it were not serious about tackling issues like poverty, unemployment and corruption. Shah said the grand alliance's ideology and objective was centered around ensuring Modi's defeat in the 2019 general elections. “Modi Modi Modi, he is a phobia for them,” Shah said in his address in the poll-bound state. Shah highlighted that the leaders of regional parties who were part of the alliance were defeated in their respective states by the BJP who went on to form the governments there. In Assam, 40 lakh illegal immigrants were identified and the process to delete their names from voters list caused heartburn to these leaders, Shah said. He further called upon the youth members of the party to understand their responsibilities, work culture of the organisation and struggles of senior leaders. It is the responsibility of the youth to take the party forward, he said, adding that the BJP was the largest political party in the world with 11 crore members and ruling about 70 per cent of the country. Shah said that BJP had internal democracy and was the party of workers. This is the only party in the world which nominated its member, who was a tea seller, for the post of the country’s prime minister and has an erstwhile booth worker as its president, he said. On the contrary, one can become a Congress president by the virtue of being born in a particular family. Addressing a gathering of intellectuals later, Shah said that he did not want them to vote for the BJP and instead urged them to set a narrative and create an atmosphere so that the masses vote for the party. Your work is to set the narrative as the public knows you, listens to you and follows you, said Shah. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Shashi Tharoor,"The story of the last four years is one of missed opportunities and dashed hopes, of waiting for   that never came, of seeing expectations raised to the heights by lofty rhetoric, only to come crashing down in the face of depressing reality. 26 May marks the fourth anniversary of an era of disappointment for believers, of vindication for the sceptics, and of frustration for all who want India to thrive. How does one look back at these four years? Economics is clearly a vital prism: Mr Modi came to power boasting of his prowess at economic development, telling the nation he had been a successful CEO of Gujarat Inc and was ready to do for India what he had done for his state. Against that yardstick, we have a stunning checklist of spectacular failures, headed by a GDP growth rate that has fallen by 2.2 percent because of the twin self-inflicted blows of demonetisation (a bad idea implemented badly) and the botched rollout of GST (a good idea implemented badly). A government that promised two crore new jobs a year – eight crore in four years – has generated precisely 18 lakh jobs in that time, and the thrasonical prime minister has been reduced to claiming that  -sellers on sidewalks should also be counted in the employment figures. The BJP government earned a windfall of $40 billion or Rs 2,33,000 crore in its first three years, thanks to a collapse in benchmark crude oil prices from $108.05 to $48.82 (May 2014 to May 2017) whose benefits it refused to pass on to the  . Instead, it levied in extra taxes what might have been saved at the pump, failing to produce a stimulus to the economy, and, given the subsequent rise in global prices, leaving the Indian driver stuck with record high prices at the pump, even as the rupee tumbles to record lows near Rs 70 to the dollar. To add insult to injury, the State Bank of India, India's biggest lender, has started charging penalty on non-maintenance of minimum balance in accounts, ATM charges and other services – inflicting pain on 31 crore savings account holders, including pensioners and students. Instead of being a game-changing government, the BJP has turned out to be a name-changing one. The only successes it can point to are of schemes that were initiated by the UPA and often criticised at the time by the Opposition BJP: Other promises have been dashed with impunity. The PM grandiloquently pledged to bring back the nation’s “black money” stashed abroad, and put 15 lakhs into every Indian’s bank account; neither has happened. The leader who said “ ” has presided over a bewildering variety of world-class scams, from the Vyapam scandal in Madhya Pradesh to a PDS scam in Chhattisgarh, a GSPC scam in Gujarat and a mining scam in Rajasthan, even as his own foreign minister bypasses official channels to seek protection for an Indian fugitive in London and the Panama Papers are given a quiet burial. Repeated terrorist attacks, border ceasefire violations, massive infiltration of terrorists from across the border, incursion into Indian territory by Chinese and Pakistani soldiers, and the frequency of terrorist attacks on Indian Army bases and military installations in Kashmir — none of this speaks well of the competence of our government in keeping us safe. The domestic record is no better, with the ugly horrors of Naxalism proving the abject failure of the BJP government, which has ensured neither development nor internal security. Every proud Indian wishes to say a good word about foreign policy: I have long argued that there is no such thing as a Congress foreign policy or a BJP foreign policy; only Indian national interests which any government of any party must uphold. The government’s foreign policy record over four years has been marked by: Had we more space, this threnody could have been twice as long and thrice as painful. For we haven’t even begun to address the painful litany of intangible assaults on all that most Indians hold precious about their country: the overt, triumphalist majoritarianism that has sent alarm bells off among the minorities, the excesses of the “cow vigilantes” and “mob-lynchers”, the purchase of political loyalties by rampant financial corruption, and the subversion of institutions to serve a narrow sectarian political agenda. Our only hope is that by the fifth anniversary of the BJP’s ascent, we won’t need to worry about any of these, because this disastrous government will be gone.

Smitha TK,"Mohd Irshad Alam Vikram Venkateswaran For over two decades, the people of Tuticorin have been protesting against the Sterlite copper plant, alleging that it had been posing an environmental and health hazard. Their repeated pleas to the government fell on deaf ears. spoke to P Ramnath, CEO of Sterlite Copper Vedanta Limited to get Sterlite’s answer to the people’s questions. That fateful day was supposed to be a day of victory, as the people’s agitation against the Sterlite copper smelter plant entered its 100th day. But it turned out to be one of agony and violence. As they marched towards the Collectorate, violence broke out between the people and police. Soon, the cops opened fire, killing 13 and injuring at least 200. A few days later, the state government was forced to order the permanent closure of the plant under pressure from the public. Since then, the company has undertaken several efforts to appeal to the courts to, the government, and the National Green Tribunal to reopen the plant, but they have been given a big NO across all fronts. There is a belt of factories around these villages but residents allege that the toxic fumes let out by the Sterlite plant is the cause. There have been initial NEERI reports stating that Sterlite has let out harmful effluents into the air and the groundwater table. P Ramnath of Sterlite clarified that “there are several power plants, nearly 4000MW of electricity is being produced in Thoothukudi. All these power plants use coal which contains 2% of sulphur.” Ramnath claims that as required by the Supreme Court order of 2013, Sterlite has been sending a medical van to these villages everyday, and they have been submitting all the records to the Pollution Control Board every six months. Regular checkups of the employees and their families have been done, and they haven’t found any instances of cancer. The water table in the area has been depleted for decades now. But villagers say that since the effluents from Sterlite have been mixing with the groundwater, levels have dipped abysmally. They were able to use the water pumped through their borewells only for bathing, and even that would make their skin itch. But Sterlite has brushed aside these allegations as well, saying it is a ‘ ’ since its inception in 1995. Ramnath said that over the years, they have spent over Rs 500 crore in various mitigation measures and even have state-of-the-art laser-based technology to detect any emission that leaves the premises. All these stats are monitored live by the Pollution Control Board, he says. “We have even laid entire pipelines so that the village can get water through these pipelines, and prior to that we were supplying water through tankers,” he said. Considering Thoothukudi is a water-deficient district, the company says they have behaved as a responsible manufacturing company and minimised utilising the groundwater for their industrial purposes. Sterlite stated that every month, Pollution Control Board representatives had visited their plant and assessed the groundwater samples, and found that levels of all marker pollutants – arsenic, zinc, and fluorides – were found to be well below the permissible limits. When   visited Tuticorin after the 22 May incident there, was seething anger. But two months later, there was fear. Fear of the police – and Sterlite. The villagers alleged that the police have been knocking on their doors even during the wee hours of the night, and arresting men. When asked for the reason for the arrests, the police have said that they have been tracking people based on pictures and videos shown on media channels. They also blamed Sterlite for tracking key leaders of the protest, bribing people and attempting to create internal conflict. However, Sterlite brushed the allegations aside, saying they had nothing to do with the 22 May incident or the police atrocity thereafter. What is baffling is why the government has not initiated a study to find out the cause of the illnesses around Sterlite. If the NEERI report found that the Sterlite factory’s emissions were way over the permissible limits, why were checks not conducted? Why are there no reports released by the hospitals to show the number of cancer and respiratory disorder cases caused by inhaling toxic fumes? Sterlite claims that this is nothing but a blame game, but the question is, what have they done to debunk the rumours? The company said that they have been doing extensive CSR work, reaching out to the public, having constant dialogues with the villagers and conducting regular health check-ups. The Tamil Nadu government is coming down on Sterlite copper unit with an iron hand, refusing to reopen it. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In Hyderabad to formally launch the party's poll campaign at a public meeting in Mahabubnagar, about 110 km away from the city, Shah said the BJP would not go for a tie-up with the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), the ruling party in the southern state. The BJP would not have any alliance with any party and it hoped to emerge as a “deciding factor” in the upcoming polls, he said. The saffron party would also fight against the ""stalled progress"" of the state, he said, when asked about allegations of a tacit understanding between the BJP and the TRS. On the proposed Grand Alliance of the Congress and other parties in the state, Shah said the Telugu people had not forgotten how the Congress had treated their leaders like former (undivided) Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Anjaiah and former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao. Hitting out at the TRS, he claimed that the K Chandrasekhar Rao-led party was earlier in favour of simultaneous elections to the state Assembly and Lok Sabha, but subsequently changed its stand. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proposed 'one nation, one election'. (Caretaker CM) Chandrasekhar Rao had also supported it initially.... I want to ask a straight question to the ruling party (TRS) and the chief minister. Why are you burdening the people with so much of expenditure (due to polls)? What is the reason for advancing the election by nine months?,"" Shah asked. Quoting from reports, the BJP chief said 4,200 farmers took their own lives in the state in the last four years and claimed that some of the schemes of the central government were not implemented in Telangana properly. He said many poll promises such as the ""double-bedroom housing scheme"" were not fulfilled. Shah said the Centre had allotted funds to the extent of Rs 2.30 lakh crore to Telangana under the 14th Finance Commission as against ""a mere Rs 15,000 crore during the 13th Finance Commission"". He claimed that the state government was not celebrating 17 September (the day the erstwhile Nizam state had merged with the Indian Union in 1948) officially due to ""pressure from the AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen) and as part of vote-bank politics"". ""Are we going to handover Telangana to the new-age Razakars (private militia that had resisted the integration of the Hyderabad state into the Dominion of India)? The Telangana people should decide,"" the BJP chief said. He added that despite being aware that there would be no quota based on religion, the TRS government had passed a bill in this regard and sent it to the Centre for consent. Shah said the new districts that were carved out by the TRS government lacked infrastructure. He slammed the Congress, alleging that it did not allow the OBC Commission Bill to be passed. Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the BJP was suffering from ""selective amnesia"". ""You (BJP) will not succeed either in Hyderabad or in Telangana. I would like to say that if you have any strategy, Mr Shah, then come to Hyderabad and contest the parliamentary polls from here...,"" he said, replying to a query. Owaisi claimed that the BJP would not be able to save their five Assembly seats in Hyderabad as also the Secunderabad Lok Sabha seat. Lauding Rao for advancing the polls by nine months, Owaisi said, ""It is a bold decision. You (BJP) are scared. You fight it out if you are concerned.""

Revati Laul,"Zed* and I clinked our beer mugs in celebration. It was a brilliant day. The Supreme Court verdict striking down section 377 meant she was no longer a criminal for being gay. “Damn it, now I will have to step up my game and re-order the balance so that one of us is still criminal or deviant at least,” I said, laughing into the beer-froth. It was pouring down a mad, raucous rain and Cyber-Hub in Gurugram, young people in the IT suburb of Delhi were out and about, soaking up some evening suds in pubs all across. In the one we were at, we asked the crooner to please play the Tracy Chapman song –   to go with what had just happened. She happily obliged. “Any place is better…starting from zero we got nothing to lose…” she sang in a rich voice that matched Tracy’s. Gay, black Tracy. Zed told me about starting from zero. What it’s like to be a woman and gay. “You have no community, I really miss that,” she said. It’s not the same thing talking to straight people like me. Not having a community to share the anxiety of each other, of not being ‘out’ and having partners who are not ‘out’ and the fear that comes with it. Not being able to do the simplest things like holding hands in a store. Or being comfortable in your own skin, not having to cover-up, side-step everyone else’s discomfort and fear. Just being. And then when the order was reversed, the pubs vanished. And my friends told me that it was back to skulking around in dark corridors or meeting quietly in each other’s homes. Always cautious. Always on guard. In one of Zed’s online groups for gay women, a friend was going crazy trying to call her to just shout out loud about the momentousness of the day, of having 377 struck down. But Zed was in a meeting. To deal with the uncontainable need to shout out loud, her friend called every NGO and activist group she could find online to say thank you. She was bursting with excitement with nowhere to take it. I went back to a conversation I had over dinner nine months ago, where a group of the country’s most distinguished lawyers and judges were present. They were hosting an Australian judge with a legendary track record on human rights work, who was also gay. The conversation veered around 377. “If it’s all about unnatural sex and penile penetration from the ass, then isn’t it all focused only on men,” I asked everyone at the table. “Is no one concerned with what women do? Is that legal or illegal or does it not even count?” Everyone at the table was unanimous in saying that, regrettably, it didn’t even count. I said that Zed had told me a woman pleasuring a woman is different from a man on a man. Both men said I was stereotyping men and women, gay and straight sex. Why couldn’t it all be seen as the same and no big deal? Sex after all, by any other name, is still just sex. Zed had told me a riveting story about the absolute lush pleasure of having a woman work on a woman. Zed has been bisexual. She knew the difference between having sex with a man and a woman. “With a woman the focus is never the clit or the body,” she explained. “It’s the mind. It’s so much fore-play that you could orgasm many times before you reach your climax.” You could be with a sharp and attentive man who knows all your pleasure spots, but men are still finally leading up to pleasuring organs – yours and then theirs. Women are not. They work on your ankles or ears to work on them. Not to lead up to a final focus elsewhere. They instinctively know timing, Zed explained. Of course, you could be with a man and it may be as much of an adventure. Are dildos as essential prerequisite or are hands and mouths enough? My mind went back to a conversation I had whilst I was on a short reporting stint in Afghanistan. A friend was researching the condition of women in Afghan prisons – and found there was a woman-oppressor,  who was shoving dildos into her inmates. Where did she get it from or did she make her own – we had asked ourselves. But the obsession with machines isn’t about gay or straight at all. It’s about normalising conversations we need to have. I   about dildos once. Straight people were buying them. I spoke to a supplier in Bhilwara, Rajasthan. Another in Bangalore who supplied them to men and women in Kerala, Kashmir and small towns like Latur in Maharashtra. To distort the laws of physics, I would say, the less we talk about what we do and how much fun it is, the bigger it gets – till a ginormous Supreme Court-sized verdict hits us in the face, showing us the decades of silence and self-loathing we have created. Zed and I thanked the crooner for singing Tracy Chapman. I shouted out to her and said – “Down with 377! Can you say that as well, please?” The crooner smiled and refused. “No, I am sorry, I can’t do that here.” The courts had forced straight people out of their criminal prejudice and bigotry. They would have to let go of criminally-oppressive behaviour from now on. Zed’s phone rang. It was a friend from another country, calling to congratulate her. “Yes, it’s great. We can still be stoned and lynched, but at least we can’t be arrested anymore,” she said.  ‘ ’,    (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

TS Sudhir,"“I have 30 per cent of Congress blood flowing in my body,” Chandrababu Naidu had said some two decades ago. At that time, the context was to tell the Congress that he is adept at outsmarting the Congress at its own game. But a look at Naidu's politics would tell you that his blood group may well be C positive. Naidu started his political career in 1978 in the Congress and was a minister in the Andhra Pradesh government at that time. As the United Front convenor in 1996, he negotiated with the Sitaram Kesri-led Congress to install two Prime Ministers - first HD Deve Gowda and then IK Gujral. Though the Telugu Desam as founded by his father-in-law NT Rama Rao had a distinct anti-Congress DNA, Naidu has not flinched from mutating it whenever it suited his political interests. Naidu's decision to let his Telangana unit work out an alliance with the Congress therefore should not surprise anyone. The TDP, for all practical purposes, is on its death bed in India's youngest state. Resuscitation by being part of a rainbow alliance to take on K Chandrasekhar Rao, is its only hope for survival. During the Telangana agitation, the TDP was labelled as an anti-Telangana party primarily because of Naidu's reluctance to support the agitation. Hailing from Rayalaseema region, he was against the division of united Andhra Pradesh. He had also realised that if Telangana was formed, his bete noire KCR would emerge as a powerful political entity. Naidu's metaphorical attempt to balance Telangana and Andhra by likening his two eyes to the two regions did not cut ice with the people of Telangana. While it helped him come to power in Andhra in 2014, he was seen as a liability in Telangana. What Naidu is doing now is practical politics. Having burnt his bridges with the BJP, he is manoeuvring his TDP bicycle into the opposition parking stand. Naidu would not like it to be likened to the return of the native but it is obvious he is ready to clasp the Congress hand more tightly than ever before. Naidu is no longer squeamish about being in a relationship with the Congress, at least in Telangana. The Congress is the senior partner in this relationship. It needs to ally with the TDP for the simple reason that Naidu's party still has a loyal vote base in many urban pockets and arithmetic is the only hope the Congress has to beat KCR's chemistry with the voter. The TDP's catchment area will be in and around Hyderabad, where a large number of people from Andhra have settled down over the years. The willingness of the Congress to accommodate the smaller parties in the   (Grand Alliance) also marks a shift in its attitude. That it is willing to take a back seat and be a team player. But is the Alliance truly Grand as it pretends to be? Would it be so easy to forget that from 1983 to 2014, the Congress and the TDP were each other's principal political rivals in united Andhra Pradesh? How willing will be a Congress activist to work for a TDP candidate and vice versa? That will hold the key to the success of the alliance. Another important aspect will be to manage dissent after the distribution of tickets. Two previous attempts–in the Achampet civic body election and Palair assembly bypoll–both in 2016, when the opposition put up common candidates against the ruling TRS, came a cropper. This is because usually people bless an alliance when it is focused on taking up people's issues rather than the selfish motive of coming to power. The opposition alliance at this point in time, runs the risk of appearing like a cluster of several chief ministeral aspirants, each eager to unseat KCR. KCR has already sharpened his knives, planning to once again make Naidu the villain of the piece. The TRS chief has already labelled the TDP an “Andhra party” and he can be expected to make the previous discrimination of Telangana at Andhra rulers' hands, the main weapon in his political armoury. The Congress response is that if it was not unethical for KCR to admit a dozen TDP lawmakers into his party, there can be nothing objectionable about working with Naidu. But neither the TDP nor the Congress in Andhra is happy with the Telangana arrangement. This is because the Congress having presided over the division of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, is extremely unpopular in the residuary state and TDP will only burn its fingers if it allies with the national party in his state. The Congress on the other hand, is fearful that even if there is a tacit understanding, Naidu will gobble up the Congress votes and accelerate the process of the party's complete annihilation in the state. The Telangana experiment will give an idea of how well the opposition can stitch together a state-by-state alliance to defeat the BJP or its ‘friendly’ parties like the TRS. From a national point of view, therefore, the Telangana template will be watched closely. If these two political rivals can collaborate to create electoral success, it will be held as a model for arch-enemies in other states to emulate. The proof of political anxiety is in the name calling. The mocking of Naidu and Telangana Congress chief Uttam Kumar Reddy as two ambitious bearded men by senior TRS leaders is a giveaway that the ruling party sees this alliance as having the potential, at least on paper. ’s      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Rithika Kumar,"Although female voter turnout has been increasing across India – from 51 percent in 1980 to 66 percent in 2014 – it remains low when compared with the adult population sex ratio in most states. As campaigning for the 2019 general elections gathers steam, female voter turnout trends are important for political parties’ campaigning strategies, as also for the Election Commission of India’s Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, now nearly a decade old. Improving women’s participation in voting holds the key to greater voter turnout and socio-political gender parity. Sex ratio of voters (SRV) is an important metric to assess gender differences in electoral turnout. Similar to the population sex ratio (PSR), SRV is the number of female voters per 1,000 male voters who actually cast their vote. An SRV of 1,000 will mean the same number of men and women turned up to vote while an SRV below or above 1,000 will mean that more or fewer men than women turned up to vote. Calculating the sex ratio of voters who took to the ballot in the 2014 national election across all 543 parliamentary constituencies in the country revealed, that nine out of 10 constituencies with the poorest sex ratio of voters are located in Madhya Pradesh. One might assume that this turnout simply mirrors the underlying PSR (of those over the age of 18 years). To verify this conjecture, we need the underlying adult PSR for a given constituency. Electoral rolls could have been the best estimate, but   suggest these may not be accurate. The Census, however, provides this information for all districts in the country. There are 640 districts in India (as per the 2011 Census) vis-a-vis 543 parliamentary constituencies. Roughly, there are a 100-odd more districts than parliamentary constituencies, meaning one constituency might be spread over two districts. In the absence of a one-to-one match between the administrative and electoral data in India, the district-level Census data on adult PSR is the closest approximation of the underlying sex ratio of the adult population in a constituency. Across all parliamentary constituencies in the country, Bhind has the lowest SRV. If a low SRV is a function of a low PSR, the districts that make up the Bhind constituency (Bhind and Datia) should also have a low PSR. That is not the case, as Table 2, which lists the 15 districts with the worst PSR in the country, shows. This mismatch between PSR and SRV also occurs at the aggregate state level. The figure below presents the gaps in SRV and PSR in descending order for all states in India. Madhya Pradesh, again, has the largest gap (169 women per 1,000 men) between SRV and PSR, followed by Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. At the other end of the spectrum is Arunachal Pradesh, where the gap is negative–more women than men (in comparison to the PSR) turned out to vote. Both cases suggest that the adult population sex composition alone might not explain the variation in the sex ratio of the voting population. Delving deeper into the intra-state variation using maps enables one to identify spatial trends. Consider the case of Madhya Pradesh again. The state-level SRV is 771 (the lowest in the country), but when broken down by PC, there is huge variation within the state as well (Figure 2 and 3). Neemuch and Mandsaur districts have an average PSR of 973. They are subsumed within the Mandsaur parliamentary constituency, which has an SRV of only 813. While this is a gap of about 140 women per 1,000 men, in some cases the gap between the two is much larger. In Bhind (comprised of Bhind and Datia districts), the gap between the PSR and SRV is over 280 women per 1,000 men. This points to a wide variation within Madhya Pradesh with respect to SRV vis-a-vis PSR. This variation is at the crux of understanding why, independent of the PSR, women in some areas within a state are turning up to vote in larger numbers. Anything from cultural factors to administrative hiccups like less-inclusive electoral lists could be responsible for this. The Election Commission of India, to its credit, has been making tremendous efforts to improve political participation among women through its SVEEP programme. With more up-to-date electoral lists and massive voter registration and awareness drives under SVEEP, it will be possible to analyse and understand the sex composition of voters in the upcoming elections.

Vishnu Gopinath,"A 25-year-old woman was killed by a stalker who stabbed her over 38 times, in Indore, on Thursday, 13 September night, police said. Kamlesh Sahu, who admitted to killing Supriya Jain, had been stalking her on Facebook for a long time and killed her because he couldn’t bear to see her “adopt a modern lifestyle and make male friends”,    . Police told  that Kamlesh Sahu, the suspect, attacked Supriya late 13 September night, outside her office. He covered his face with a handkerchief, and grabbed Supriya on the busy road outside her office, in front of Indore’s CHL Hospital. Kamlesh was arrested and sent to jail after the incident. The 25-year-old victim, Supriya Jain, was rushed to a hospital by police, but was declared dead around 6:30 am on Friday, 14 September,  reported. MIG Road police station inspector Tehseeb Qazi told   that Kamlesh and Supriya went to the same school. He added that Kamlesh had proposed to Supriya six years ago, but that she refused to be with him. Police added that when Supriya rebuffed Kamlesh’s advances, he slashed his wrists to frighten her and force her into “accepting his proposal.” Soon after this incident, Supriya moved to Indore to complete her studies and work. However, Kamlesh found her through Facebook and began stalking her, even proposing to her once more. Supriya refused once again. Angered by her rejection, Kamlesh tracked her office and home locations through Facebook, and began following her, police said. Police officers added that Kamlesh decided to kill Supriya seven days ago, and was waiting for the ideal moment. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"Counting of votes in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union elections on 14 September were halted after members of the ABVP reportedly entered the vote counting area in the early hours of 15 September, attacked members of the Election Committee and attempted to snatch away sealed ballot boxes and ballot papers, Himanshu Kulshreshtha, the Election Committee’s Chairperson said. The EC has demanded an unconditional apology from ABVP as members of the EC have been injured badly. The AISA, DSF, BAPSA, SFI, CRJD, AISF, NSUI, SIO, YFDA, BASO, MSF, and Collective issued a joint statement against the attack by members of the ABVP. The statement in full, reads: “ Counting for the JNUSU Elections 2018-19 has been suspended by the Election Committee (EC) following violence by the ABVP members who physically attacked and injured EC members and indulged in vandalism. Late night on Friday, the EC made announcements calling for candidates to send their counting agents for central panel votes from the combined schools (science schools and smaller schools). ABVP did not send counting agents even after the last call was made. Long after sealed ballot boxes were opened and counting began, ABVP demanded that its agents be allowed in, and resorted to violence.” “But ABVP refused to follow rules that are applicable to everyone. They broke the door of SIS-I building where counting is happening, and the barricades in front. They manhandled the guards on duty, snatched phones from people who were video recording and also assaulted some of the journalists who were present there. The joint secretary candidate from ABVP even started threatening that he won't let the election process to proceed. These acts of vandalising public property and attacking the students, EC members and guards are nothing but the reflection of their frustration of being rejected by the student community.” “After this, they laid siege to the rooms and prevented anybody from entering or leaving the rooms. They even tried to capture the ballots, which the EC managed to prevent. They manhandled and injured some EC members. The ABVP's acts constitute a serious violation of the election process. The ABVP by indulging in violence has not only disrupted the counting process but also sought to undermine the sanctity of the student EC whose decision is abided by all organisations.” “We, the undersigned organisations, demand: That the ABVP members – Saurabh Sharma, Raghavendra Mishra, Akhilesh Pathak and others – vacate the counting venue immediately to allow the election process to continue.

Rule 5(b) of part 3 in Appendix 1 of JNUSU constitution says that no votes can be counted unless the counting agents of all the candidates are present at the counting hall. The rule provides that each ballot paper must be shown to the counting agents of all the candidates. EC members broke the seal of ballot box of School of Sciences in absence of the counting agents of the following candidates – Lalit Pandey, Geetasri Boruah, Ganesh Gurjar and Venkat Choubey.” “The workers of four leftist organisations – AISA, SFI, AISF and DSF – aggressively captured the counting complex and did vandalism, in which a security guard got injured. ABVP has challenged the sanctity of whole election process. The high voting percentage in Sciences and School of Languages, both of which are considered ABVP strongholds, was being seen as a sign of bright perspectives for ABVP. The interruption in vote counting done by Left, will definitely hurt the ABVP, which is tipped to have a very fine chance of winning in Central Panel.” The voter turnout in the keenly contested Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) election on Friday, 14 September, was 67.8 per cent, believed to be the highest in six years. Over 5,000 students cast their votes. The counting has begun and the results are expected to be announced on Sunday, 16 September. Last year and in 2016, the voting percentage was 59 percent. In 2015, the voting percentage was 55 percent. In 2013 and 2014, the percentage hovered around 55 per cent while in 2012, the voter turnout had reached 60 per cent. Slogans and dhapli beats filled the air on the JNU campus as candidates and their supporters made last-ditch efforts to to sway voters in their favour outside the polling centres. The voters wanted the candidates to raise issues concerning the campus instead of national issues. ""The candidates in the presidential debate talked about national issues like lynching and other things but had little to talk about the issues facing the varsity,"" said a student, not willing to be named. Polling had started at 9.30 am with students queuing up to cast their votes for the four crucial posts of president, vice-president, secretary and joint secretary. All arrangements were made by the election authorities for the JNUSU polls, which are being closely watched in the aftermath of various controversies that rocked the universities across the country in the recent past.

The Quint,"Abhishek Sharma Shohini Bose Congress leaders upped the ante against CBI on Friday, 14 September, amid the ongoing furore over liquor baron Vijay Mallya fleeing India and charged against Central Bureau of Investigation’s claim on lack of evidence to establish fraud on Mallya’s part. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “On 19 August 2014, SBI issued a notice stating Vijay Mallya is wilful defaulter. On September 2014, United Bank of India also stated same. By 2015, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and CBI registered complaints against him. So how can CBI now say that they have no proof of his fraud?” Holding that Jaitley has lost the legal, ethical and moral right to continue as minister and must resign, Surjewala said the silence of the union minister and Modi pointed at their admission of guilt. Responding to charges levelled by Congress, BJP hit back by alleging that former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and present party President Rahul Gandhi flew for free in Mallya’s airlines. Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) media head Anil Baluni fired off eight questions to the Congress. He asked if its president Rahul Gandhi and his mother and predecessor Sonia Gandhi did not fly free of cost in Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines in lieu of loans given to it. It was the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government which ""raised and protected"" the fugitive tycoon, he said, claiming that Rahul Gandhi suffers from ""ideological bankruptcy and does not know what he says, does and understands"". Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday, 13 September, questioned Rahul Gandhi and said that he wonders if the Congress President is “working in tandem” with Vijay Mallya. Prasad also claimed that the liquor baron had allegedly benefitted from bank facilities during the UPA government. This statement comes after Congress President Rahul Gandhi alleged that government and Jaitley are lying and the finance minister had “colluded with the criminal”. In a series of tweets, the Union Minister questioned why a second restructuring of Mallya's loan was allowed in 2010 contrary to rules. He also said he could understand why the Congress was becoming uncomfortable when the banking system was being made transparent and accountable. Earlier on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi reiterated his demand for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s resignation over his alleged “collusion” with fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya. Mallya had on 12 September said that he met Arun Jaitley right before leaving for London. Gandhi called the issue an “open and shut case”, alleging an under-the-table deal between the government and Mallya. Meanwhile, the finance minister, had dismissed Mallya’s claim as “false”. As soon as Jaitley rubbished Mallya’s claim, the fugitive liquor baron seemingly toned down his comment. He said that it wasn’t a formal meeting – he had only met Jaitley in the Parliament. But his so-called clarification didn’t do anything to placate the Congress which attacked the finance minister all guns blazing. Leaders from other political parties joined the chorus. Meanwhile, Congress Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala addressed another press conference, raking up PM Modi’s alleged meet with fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi. Also at the press conference, Congress national spokesperson PL Punia alleged that he personally witnessed Mallya and Jaitley speak at the Parliament House in 2016. “I saw Mally and Jaitley meet. It was Mallya’s first parliament session. Few days later, we found out that he had left the country”, he said, adding that Jaitley had concealed this fact for the longest time. On Wednesday, Gandhi had called Mallya’s claims “extremely serious allegations”. The Congress President went on to demand Jaitley’s resignation. Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi also launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jaitley. He demanded a thorough inquiry into Mallya’s claim. “Everybody was complacent and everybody was aware, whether it was a casual meeting or a structured meeting. We need proper disclosures, full inquiries on this,” Singhvi told PTI. In a swipe at the government’s ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ slogan, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP’s sole aim now was  ’ (helping absconders and enriching looters). Another Congress leader, Anand Sharma, questioned why the finance minister didn’t disclose the information the government had on Mallya during his speeches in Parliament. On Twitter, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for having allegedly met Nirav Modi before he left the country and the finance minister having met Mallya. Kejriwal also retweeted an old tweet (from 12 June 2018) by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy. Swamy in his tweet back then, had asked how could Mallya escape the country despite a Look Out Notice (LON) against him. He further questioned the dilution of the LON by someone. Even former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha raised questions against the entire BJP leadership, and said that they must come clean on their ties with the embattled liquor tycoon. CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury also claimed that all those who ‘looted public money’ and left the country, have left with the knowledge of the government. Taking a dig at the BJP and Jaitley, Congress, in a sarcastic tweet, put out a question in the  format asking – “Who helped Vijay Mallya in escaping India?” All the four answers pointing fingers at the finance minister.

Vikrant Dubey ,"Why did Mayawati not support the Opposition in the Bharat bandh called against increased petrol and diesel prices? Why did Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party not come out openly in its support? The attitudes of both these parties are confusing – are they with the larger Opposition, or not? Are they afraid of something, or is this just part of negotiation game? The Bharat bandh called by the Congress was supported by 21 groups. It can be said that this bandh indicates the strengthening of the anti-BJP coalition, and also the Congress getting back into action. But the attitude of the two main parties in Uttar Pradesh – the same state which saw the birth of this new alliance – seems iffy. Although Congress had called for the bandh, it was seen as the anti-BJP  ’s  grand alliance) show of strength. It was meant to demonstrate the  power and unity among the disparate parties. It was successful in doing that – as many as 21 groups supported the bandh, and all of them are being considered part of the coalition against the BJP. The BJP even wiped them out in the 2017 Assembly elections. But just a few months after these elections, the SP-BSP alliance managed to snatch Gorakhpur and Phulpur from BJP in the Lok Sabha by-elections. This win gave much-needed hope to both parties, which are fighting to keep themselves relevant. This coalition formula was successful in Uttar Pradesh’s Kairana Lok Sabha seat as well. In Karnataka too, Congress formed government in alliance with the JD(S). All these developments have raised hopes that the BJP can be defeated if the Opposition organises itself well. But remember, this is politics, where two plus two doesn’t usually equal four. That is why the coalition’s victory in 2019 will largely depend on it performance in UP, where Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav are big players. The BJP will be faced with tough competition in UP if these two come together. But in order to stop the division of votes, the Congress too has to get on board. All three of them understand this, and talks about seat-sharing are on privately. Perhaps that’s the reason all three of them want to shore up their bargaining power. Now, in order to understand this game, let us first talk about Akhilesh Yadav. During the Bharat bandh, the Samajwadi Party staged demonstrations against corruption, anti-farmer policies, and various other issues in several districts. By doing so, they seemed to be associated with the bandh, even while not being completely involved. But there is no doubt that if the SP had openly joined the bandh, UP would have dominated the headlines, especially because SP workers are usually more aggressive when they take out bandhs. But on 10 September, contrary to its nature, the SP exercised restraint. Clearly, the Congress would have gotten all the credit for the bandh’s success as they were the ones who called for it in the first place. If that had happened, it would have given the Congress, which is barely visible in the state, a major boost. This would not augur well for the SP-BSP – both of them know that the stronger the Congress gets, the more it will aspire to a higher number of seats. The BSP was totally absent from the bandh. To be fair, the BSP seldom takes issues to the streets. The last time BSP demonstrated on the streets was around two years back to protest BJP’s Dayashankar Singh, who had made derogatory comments about Mayawati. So it wasn’t surprising that the BSP did not join the protests. What was surprising though was that Mayawati   the bandh on its second day, 11 September. This does not bode well for the alliance’s future. The question is: Why did Mayawati do this? All in all, it can be said that the Congress’ bandh was both successful as well as unsuccessful – unsuccessful because it has exposed the weak links in the alliance forming against the BJP.

PTI,"President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort agreed Friday, 14 September, to cooperate in the special counsel investigation of possible campaign collusion with Russia. In a plea deal to avert a second trial on money laundering and illegal lobbying charges, Manafort agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy against the United States and another count of obstruction of justice. The move comes as Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia increasingly pressures the White House. Manafort, who worked for the Trump campaign for nearly six months in the middle of 2016, was already convicted in a separate jury trial on eight counts related to financial fraud in August.

Arun Dev,"In July 2017, when the Gujarat Congress decided to shift 44 of their MLAs from the state, to avoid poaching ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls, the task of keeping them safe in Karnataka was given to their go-to-man – DK Shivakumar. The reputation he gained during that 2017 episode ensured that Shivakumar was given the task of keeping Congress MLAs in Karnataka safe, ahead of the crucial vote of confidence after the 2018 Assembly election in May. DK Shivakumar’s aspiration to become the chief minister is not a secret in political circles. To increase his sphere of influence beyond his stronghold in South Karnataka, he has allegedly attempted a proxy coup in the local politics of North Karnataka’s Belagavi district, located more than 500 km from Bengaluru. Keeping Laxmi Hebbalkar, another Congress leader, in front, he is attempting to win control over the local bodies and institutions in Belagavi. But the two Jarkiholi brothers – Ramesh and Satish – have asked the Congress to keep DK Shivakumar out of Belagavi or face the consequences. But what exactly has Shivakumar been doing to take on the brothers in the region? After Bengaluru, Belagavi has the highest number of constituencies in Karnataka. To become chief minister someday, Shivakumar requires the support of legislators beyond his stronghold in South Karnataka – and Belagavi happens to be the biggest district in North Karnataka. The younger brother, Satish, is an aspirant for the post of chief minister, mainly because of the influence the family has over Belagavi and other parts of North Karnataka. DK Shivakumar’s attempts to enter Belagavi’s politics are being looked at as a means to reduce the Jarkiholis’ influence over the region and gain loyalists from the region who would instead support him. In this task, a Congress leader from North Karnataka, Laxmi Hebbalkar is DK Shivakumar’s new ally. She is contesting the political clout enjoyed by the Jarkiholi brothers, by trying to control the cooperative and other smaller banks, which are key to the businesses and politics of the region. For instance, Hebbalkar, with the help of DK Shivakumar, had successfully managed to replace the Jarkiholis’ men with candidates of her choice on the board of the Primary Land Development Bank in Belagavi, in the first week of September. After control over the banks, the next front Shivakumar has tried to open has been that of caste equations. The two Jarkiholi brothers belong to the Valmiki community, which is a Scheduled Tribe (ST). But Belagavi has a large Lingayat population, to which Hebbalkar belongs. Hebbalkar and DK Shivakumar hope this will gain her the support of the influential community. This in turn would help DK Shivakumar field candidates of his choice in the upcoming elections, citing Hebbalkar’s popularity in the Lingayat community This move, however, has now led to the unification of the warring members of the Valmiki community, perhaps even across party lines. According to Congress party sources, there are talks going on between Ramesh Jarkiholi and BJP leader Sriramulu, who is also a Valmiki, to get their children married. Shivakumar, although from South Karnataka, has been appointed as the district in-charge minister for Ballari (more popularly known as Bellary) district in North Karnataka. Two influential MLAs from the district, Anant Singh and B Nagendra, are already loyal to him. Apart from them, one of the strong leaders from North Karnataka’s Dharwad – Vinay Kulkarni – is also a close ally of Shivakumar. The controversy created by DK Shivakumar’s coup has resulted in instability in the coalition government, leading to speculation that the Jarkiholi brothers could leave the Congress for the BJP. BS Yeddyurappa, former chief minister and state president of the BJP may have indicated this when he claimed ‘some prominent leaders’ will be joining the BJP soon. Ramesh Jarkiholi, however, met Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and clarified he and his brother won’t be going over to the BJP. However, he also insisted that DK Shivakumar should stay out of Belagavi’s politics.. With the Jarkiholi brothers mounting pressure on the Congress, DK Shivakumar has been asked to take a step back by the party. However, many within the Congress party believe it might take a while before the instability caused by his ambition settles down. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Arun Dev,"The fate of Karnataka’s coalition government currently rests on the ego of two brothers from Belagavi district. The 2018 Assembly election was just around the corner when the Congress realised that former chief minister Siddaramaiah was losing popularity in his home turf, Chamundeshwari. The party decided that he would contest from another seat in North Karnataka – Badami. A star campaigner for the Congress, Siddaramaiah campaigned in Badami just twice. But the party was certain of a win, because Satish Jarkiholi, a sugar baron and political powerhouse in North Karnataka, was tasked with ensuring Siddaramaiah’s victory. And win he did, even without serious campaigning efforts. Satish wasn’t given a Cabinet berth in the Congress-JDS coalition government. Although a rebellion was expected, he supported the party. But, a few months later, an ego clash over the board of a local bank in Belagavi district has Satish and his brother Ramesh up in arms, even threatening the stability of the coalition. The politics in Belagavi, which has the second highest number of seats in Karnataka after Bengaluru, has been controlled by the Jarkiholi brothers. The political power of the five Jarkiholi brothers – Ramesh, Satish, Balachandra, Bhishmi and Lankan – is linked to the fortune they have amassed from their sugar business. While Ramesh, Satish and Lankan are part of the Congress, Balachandra and Bhimshi are part of the BJP. Even though the brothers have different political views, but when it comes to controlling the three sugar factories they own, they have set their differences aside. The control over the Primary Land Development (PLD) bank is crucial for the brothers to keep the control over their sugar business, and in turn, the politics of the region. Unlike other cooperative banks, the PLD bank grants loans for large land-owning farmers, for farming and buying machinery. The collateral for the loans is often the produce from the farms and the prominent produce in the region is sugarcane. But in the last month of August, an election was called for post of president and vice president after another Congress leader Laxmi Hebbalkar , allegedly supported by Congress minister DK Shivakumar, fielded two candidates against the men nominated by the brothers. The brothers were even more furious when they realised that one of the men Hebbalkar nominated was Bapu Gauda Patil, a trusted aide of the brothers, who was bought over by Hebbalkar. Laxmi Hebbalkar – who doesn’t hail from a political family – rose to prominence through the grassroot levels and into the state politics. Her association with the Jarkiholi family, especially Ramesh, was one of the reasons behind her political growth. According to the Congress leaders in Belagavi, Hebbalkar played a crucial role in brokering peace between the Jarkiholi brothers when issues arose. She was also one of the reasons, allegedly, for Satish losing his ministerial post in the previous Congress government – and Ramesh replacing him. The two Jarkiholi brothers were not happy about candidates being fielded against the old practice of the brothers themselves nominating the bank officials. But Hebbalkar refused to withdraw the candidates supported by her and the matter went to court. In the meantime, along came the urban local body (ULB) elections on 31 August. To show their strength, the two Jarkiholi brothers fielded several independent candidates in their hometown of Gokak in Belagavi. Even Hebbalkar fielded her candidates, but out of 31 seats, 30 were won by candidates fielded by the two Jarkiholi brothers. Despite the ULB victory, the battle of PLD bank continued, and a court directed that election should be conducted. The disgruntled Jarkiholi brothers were convinced by the Congress leadership, including KPCC vice president Eshwar Kandre, to withdraw their candidates and let Hebbalkar’s candidates win. Hebbalkar’s victory was a loss of face for the brothers. The meeting tickled off the brothers. In a statement to the press, Jarkiholi attacked Hebbalkar and Shivakumar asking them to stay away from Belagavi’s politics, just as the brothers have always stayed away from Shivakumar’s territory. This was followed by speculation of Satish being in talks with the BJP. The rumours became a headache for the Congress when BJP party president B.S Yeddyurappa abruptly cut his trip to Delhi short to return to Bengaluru. He soon announced that some prominent Congress leaders would be joining the BJP soon. Ramesh and Satish hold sway over enough MLAs to remove the current coalition from majority. In a latest statement, Ramesh announced Satish as a candidate for the chief ministerial post, declaring their power in controlling the future of the coalition. As per latest reports, the brothers have threatened to quit the party and even take MLAs supporting them to the BJP’s camp. Following this, senior leaders from the Congress have been holding meetings with the brothers, knowing the sway they hold and the damage to the coalition their departure could cause. The damage, however, for the time being, has been stalled and the Congress has managed to pacify the brothers for now. But unless the battle of control over Belagavi isn’t over, the coalition will have a sword hanging over its head. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

David Devadas,"David Devadas, who has covered Kashmir as a journalist for thirty years, and lived there for more than a decade, has written a book called  . Based on interactions with youth across the Valley, it gives insights into factors that have given rise to a new militancy, which has been accompanied by mass demonstrations and stone-pelting. It describes what life has been like for those born and raised in a time of violence, who now comprise more than two-thirds of the Valley’s population.  publishes an excerpt from the book: … polarised perspectives on Kashmir led to a surreal situation in which what seemed black to some seemed clearly white to others. Both views were in fact mirror images. That applied to emergent contemporary events even more than to history. There was little awareness of the various nuances in the opinions and aspirations of young Kashmiris—or of differences across space and time—which the survey findings explained in Chapter 4, ‘Varied Opinions’, showed. Some Indian analysts described ‘stone pelting’ in 2010 as a new form of militancy. Many policymakers did not seem interested in the causes of the anger that stone pelting demonstrated. Rather, they perceived it as a calibrated provocation to destabilize the state without giving the appearance of armed rebellion. Much like calling ‘wolf’, this became an awful fulfilled prophecy after 2010. By 2015–16, common people at places near an ongoing encounter took to pelting stones at the armed forces who were engaging militants in a firefight. It appeared that, at times, organisers of the new militancy used the pelting of stones as a part of coordinated multi-pronged attacks. Most of the pelters were genuinely agitated, but a round of pelting sometimes appeared to be launched by coordinated agents provocateurs. While protests certainly were revolts against the state at one level, they were often layered. Many in Kashmir saw some of the protests as expressing frustration over corruption or high prices—or over the fact that protests over such mundane matters were put down with lethal force... Many of them perceived the pelting of stones as an expression of rage by unarmed civilians pushed to a wall. They were sometimes seen as letting off steam over accumulated traumas. In that light, most people in Kashmir viewed protests from the perspective of how strongly they were put down, seeing the state’s action against protests as intolerant and brutal repression. They had asked for it, in the view of these nationalists, by taking up arms against the state. Reports, discussions, and analyses in sections of the Indian media often focused on mobs attacking the police and other forces, which tried valiantly to control those mobs. On the other hand, descriptions by Kashmiri youth, mainly on social media platforms, often focused on the killing of a youth in police action, or in an encounter with counterinsurgency forces, as the cause for the protest demonstration. In that light, they described action by the forces to quell such protests as brutal repression. Pakistani flags became highly emotional talking points in descriptions of protests, in 2010 and in 2015. Protestors sometimes waved these in processions or placed them at highly visible public spots. Many Indians viewed these as extremely provocative anti-national acts. They also saw these as proof that Kashmiris generally wanted to join Pakistan. Their comments on social media compared the enormity of shooting down protestors with the act of waving a flag, and critiqued media channels that seemed to treat flag-waving as worse than firing. When Indian nationalists called for those who waved Pakistani flags to be sent to Pakistan, many Kashmiris interpreted such comments as proof of their long-standing complaint that Indians wanted Kashmiri land and not Kashmiri people. After the Mumbai attacks, Indians by and large celebrated those of the forces who died in action as martyrs. Kashmiris, on the other hand, often viewed the police and other forces as venal and exploitative—and counterinsurgency forces in general as repressive tormentors with benefits, privileges, and extraordinary powers. So, while mainstream Indian opinion viewed action taken against errant men within the forces as lowering morale, Kashmiris generally saw punitive action as just—and indicative of good faith regarding the government’s stated commitment to uphold human rights. Since the army highly valued morale and its image, it did not make public any action it did take on a charge of rape or unauthorised killing. That secrecy was counterproductive if one wished to bridge the gap, but the image that punitive action was not taken suited those on both sides who promoted polarised narratives. The media became a major arena for the exposition and spread of black-and-white, us-versus-them narratives. The milieu of the age contributed. Singular, exclusivist ideas of self and community were gaining ground in different parts of the world. During that decade of change, a variety of media platforms had emerged to offer mass communication not only for the masses but also by the masses. This undid established media standards of veracity, balance, and responsibility for not hurting others, or excluding them. Almost anything was good enough to publish. This led to an intense competition to catch the eye of potential readers and viewers, by putting out the most sensational narratives. This encouraged one-sided narratives that overtly disparaged not only counter-views, but also any attempt at balance. ‘ ’ (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Kabir Upmanyu,"Abhishek Sharma Anubhav Mishra Students of the prestigious Delhi University cast their votes on Wednesday, 12 September, for election of the next Students' Union. The polls are being seen as a triangular fight between the RSS-affiliated ABVP, Congress' NSUI, and the alliance between AISA and AAP's student wing CYSS. The counting of the votes will take place on Thursday, with the results expected to be announced on the same day. Notably, a number of students who   spoke to on the day of the voting displayed a mistrust towards and disillusionment with the student wings which have been in power for the past few years, criticising them for failed promises, the reckless use of money and the culture of needless pamphleteering. Some even urged their fellow students to vote for the None of the Above (NOTA) option to give a message to the contestants. ""This is my fourth election in Delhi University. I haven't seen anything change in four years. The same things are being repeated even when a different party won the election last year. Hence, vote for NOTA because that will send these parties a message that just by spending money, you can't win an election,"" said Pratik Singh, a student of the Campus Law Centre. A few others were more optimistic, pointing out that some progress has been seen in the past, and urging everyone to exercise their franchise. But is this underlying disillusionment among some students big enough to make any significant impact on the election results? That would be known only on Thursday when the results are announced. Last year, the NSUI made gains in the DUSU elections by winning two posts out of four – that of president and vice-president. Meanwhile, ABVP clinched the posts of the secretary and joint secretary.

These details, including their name, address, Aadhaar number, date of birth and photograph, have been made publicly accessible on the internet for no clear reason. Thankfully, the biometric details are not available. The sites that have uploaded Aadhaar details of individuals for apparent public consumption include, among others: Here’s how easy it is to actually find the Aadhaar details of several people unknown to you. The details you will be able to access are as follows: A   article that pointed out this ease of accessing Aadhaar details of individuals unknown to you has triggered an online conversation as well. Here are some of the worrying questions that arise as a result of this revelation. And the common question, regardless of whether these websites deliberately uploaded this information publicly: These are questions that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) will have to answer. Yet again, at some stage or the other, there has been a failure to keep the Aadhaar details of individuals secure. The UIDAI cannot possibly deny the revelations made as anyone can search and verify this story for themselves. Therefore, anything short of a good explanation as to what has gone wrong will be unacceptable. The All-India Football Federation (AIFF) does not seem to understand the difference between keeping an internal records of member’s ID proofs and uploading people’s personal documents online. is refraining from sharing the specific URL on the AIFF site which reveals the data. This is to respect the privacy of hundreds of people whose personal documents are on the webpage. However, it would seem that the AIFF itself has little respect for the privacy concerns of people who provide the organisation with their identification proofs. Or worse still, the AIFF is unaware about the difference between uploading files to a private drive on the cloud versus uploading them on their website for public consumption. When someone gains access to so much of your personal information, it makes you more vulnerable to phishing. Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails or making calls claiming to be from reputable companies in order to induce people to reveal their personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. The information obtained is then used to carry out credit card frauds, unauthorised transactions and the likes. So organisations like the AIFF and government body Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services are endangering the security of the people whose personal details they are divulging online.

Vishnu Gopinath,"Air Force Chief BS Dhanoa defended the government’s Rafale Jet purchase deal, stating that the purchase of Rafale jets and S-400 missile systems was essential to give the Indian Armed Forces a technical edge against its neighbours, and would serve as a deterrent against armed conflict. “Chinese fighter aircraft have been permanently stationed in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) in the past few years. Advanced radar and surface-to-air missiles have also been stationed in the region,” Dhanoa added.  has been a flashpoint between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, with the Congress accusing the ruling party of inflating the price of Rafale jets well beyond what they actually cost. Built by the French firm, Dassault Aviation, Rafale jets are twin-engine Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA). Dassault describes Rafale as “Omnirole” jets that are versatile and can adapt to meet all air mission requirements. Between 2000-2012, the Indian Air Force’s strength declined to 34 squadrons as many jets were rendered obsolete. Each squadron consists of 18 jets and to reach its optimum capability, India requires 42 squadrons of fighter jets. The deal for 36 Rafale jets was signed on September 2016 by then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. According to reports by  , specifics of the deal included providing free training to 10 IAF personnel, including three pilots, estimated to be worth Euro 100 million. The Defence Ministry has refused to divulge details of the Rafale Jets’ pricing. The Congress has termed the deal as ‘the great Rafale mystery’. Congress President Rahul Gandhi took to social media, demanding financial details on the deal from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman. While addressing the Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accused the Congress of manufacturing allegations against the BJP Government. Jaitley accused the Congress Government too of maintaining secrecy over defence deals during its regime. Congress also alleged that the BJP government promoted the interests of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence Limited (RDL) after RDL entered into a joint venture with Dassault Aviation.

Neeraj Gupta,"Purnendu Pritam On 11 September 2018, there was a full-page advertisement published in various English and Hindi dailies. But there was something amiss, something that has been usually omnipresent so far – Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photo. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has graced every government advertisement for the last four and a half years, the very reason why many people are talking about his conspicuous absence in a government advertisement – that too, one which talks about  . First, the advertisement talks about a hefty expenditure of Rs 1,505 crore, along with the construction of two stretches of a national highway in Saharanpur and the development of Uttar Pradesh. Mind you, we're talking about the same Uttar Pradesh which contributed 71 Lok Sabha seats in 2014, thereby opening up the doors of Delhi to the BJP. Second, the advertisement features the images of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari. Now, it can't be a mere coincidence that both these leaders are seen as close to the RSS and distant to PM Modi. Now let's talk about the second picture, which is of Nagpur MP Nitin Gadkari. Gadkari's proximity to the Sangh is well-known and it is because of this proximity that he is the only minister at the Centre who acts on his own volition. He is considered to be the boldest minister in the Modi Cabinet. Speculations about the PMO's efforts to 'clip the wings' of Gadkari also keep doing the rounds. You must have seen that Modi leaves an indelible mark on every high-profile event of the government. It doesn't matter which ministry the event comes under, or who is the minister in-charge, the image of the prime minister looms large in the posters. But there are exceptions sometimes. In May this year, the inauguration for the Delhi-Meerut expressway was done by Narendra Modi. But this comes under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, so Nitin Gadkari was seen in an equal number of pictures. While the BJP claims that Modi ji's image exists in every heart, we should know that there is a message which comes in an advertisement such as this. All in all, the advertisement featuring Nitin Gadkari and Yogi Adityanath's smiling faces clearly says that there is something within the BJP which is not quite right. And that there are some people who are clearly making their presence felt. Responding to the controversy over this advertisement, Transport Ministry officials have clarified that it is as per the SC guidelines on government ads and that there is nothing unusual about it. If there's a photo of the PM, then it cannot have a minister's photo, and if there's a minister's photo, then the PM's picture cannot be there, they said. They added that if it is a state government advertisement, then a union minister's photo is allowed, along with that of the CM. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Shashi Tharoor,"Nearly seventy-one years after adopting one of the world’s most liberal constitutions, India can finally celebrate the expunging of a nasty colonial-era provision in its penal code, Section 377, which criminalised ‘whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal.’ Section 377 made any sex apart from penile-vaginal intercourse between a man and a woman—any sex the authorities in power decide is ‘against the order of nature’—to be illegal. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the personal sexual preferences of adults is indeed as nature made them, and that it is lawful for them to be themselves. Obviously this is great news for the LGBTQ+ community, whose idea of what is ‘natural’ reflects their sexual orientation. But it also impacts married heterosexual couples since theoretically, an act of oral sex between a husband and a wife is also illegal. And if you’re not married to each other, of course, it’s worse. If Bill Clinton had been an Indian, he might have survived impeachment after the Monica Lewinsky affair, but he’d have ended up in jail under Section 377. Though not widely used—fewer than a thousand arrests a year under Section 377— the law was a tool for the harassment, persecution, and blackmail of sexual minorities within India. Beyond forcing millions of gay men and women to live in fear and secrecy, Section 377 undermined HIV-prevention efforts and contributed to depression and suicides. A 2014 study by the World Bank revealed that India suffers a loss of between 0.1 per cent and 1.7 percent of GDP because of such homophobia. The Supreme Court’s decision recognises that by giving the state the authority to control what Indian adults do, consensually, in their bedrooms, Section 377 violates the constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, and equality enshrined in Articles 14, 15, and 21, respectively. Its decision means that all consensual sex between consenting adults, irrespective of gender and sex, is now legal. This does not imply, as ill-informed critics on social media are alleging, that in the process it legitimises forced sex (or rape), sex with animals, paedophilia or pederasty. In 2013, the Supreme Court had overturned a liberal Delhi High Court ruling which struck down Section 377 in 2009. The heavens did not fall after the High Court ruling; Indian society did not collapse. Yet bigots petitioned to reverse that decision, ultimately succeeding in turning back the clock for gay rights in India in 2013, when the Supreme Court overturned the High Court’s decision. Like many Indians, I found the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling antithetical to India’s commitment to pluralism and democracy, which provides for the embrace of a multitude of identities, including those based on sexual orientation. So, in December 2015, I sought to introduce a bill that would have amended Section 377 and decriminalised all consensual sex between adults, irrespective of their gender and sexuality, but a vocal section of homophobes from the ruling party defeated my attempt even to introduce my Bill in Parliament. The same thing happened when I tried again in March 2016. Sneering comments were made about my alleged personal interest in the Bill, to which I responded that one does not need to be a cow to defend the rights of animals. The BJP’s vote was incongruous on several levels, but most glaringly in its rejection of millennia of Indian practice in favour of a British colonial law (which the British themselves have outgrown). The Indian ethos toward sexual difference has historically been liberal, with neither mythology nor history revealing the persecution or prosecution of sexual heterodoxy. In fact, the Hindu epics are dotted with characters like Shikhandi in the  , who was born female and became male; many Hindus venerate the half-man, half-woman  ; and temple sculptures across India depict homosexual acts. Yet the BJP, the party of Hindu chauvinism, chooses to ignore this Hindu tradition. In its 2013 judgment that reaffirmed Section 377, the Supreme Court said that legislators, not judges, must decide its fate. Unfortunately, the Parliament has proved itself unequal to the task; the bigotry and homophobia in the ruling party and the indifference and prejudice in much of the Opposition, had rendered the institution a temple of hypocrisy on this issue. Indeed, legislative recourse for the injustice of Section 377 would not have been available as long as the BJP is in power. After all, whereas change via legislation would require political courage—a quality sorely lacking in the current Indian government—the judiciary is not hampered by such considerations. Today’s good news confirms that India’s Supreme Court has an exemplary record of interpreting statutes in a way that expands human rights in the country. The hope remains that the Supreme Court will consistently uphold an idea of India in which the law embodies constitutional values of privacy, equality, dignity, and non-discrimination for all citizens. During the case whose verdict has come today, the words of Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, one of the justices on the bench hearing the petitions against Section 377, were especially heartening: ‘The whole object of fundamental rights is to give the court power to strike down laws which a majoritarian government, swung by votes, will not repeal. We don’t wait for majoritarian governments to repeal laws. If a law is unconstitutional, it is the duty of the court to strike it down.’ The alternative—allowing Indian law to continue to serve as an iron cage for some of our people—would have directly undermined the freedom of identity and expression that constitutes the backbone of Indian democracy. What is more, it would have left India out of step with much of the rest of the international community, a country embarrassed before the world’s other democracies. Thanks to the Supreme Court, all Indian democrats—and not just the LGBT community – can hold their heads up with pride, and walk with dignity and freedom today.

Subhro Prokas Mukherjee,"If Modi does not become the prime minister in 2019, one can’t expect him to sit in Parliament as the Leader of the Opposition, as his megalomania won’t allow him to take up such trifling posts. I have little doubt in my mind that Modi will play the ‘naughty boy’ in ‘class’ so that a billion-plus people appoint the ‘naughtiest boy’ as the ‘class monitor’ aka prime minister – again. It is in the larger interest of the politics of liberalism and inclusive development that Prime Minister Modi keeps his seat in 2019-2024, albeit with a diminished majority in the Lok Sabha. Modi will have an easy excuse for not forming the government if he is restricted to around 150 seats but he will be compelled to form the government if he has 200-220 seats in the Lok Sabha.  I am of the opinion that the sine qua non for the present Opposition to the present ruling regime ought not be in merely ensuring an electoral defeat for Modi through strategic alliances, but to permanently reduce the chances of a repetition of such a dominant electoral performance by such a person as Modi. If the Modi-led BJP’s ascent is stymied through tactical opposition alliances, the prima donna party will, in all probability, beat the alliance anyway, as it is likely to an effective opposition in highlighting the contradictions in the alliance. Thus, it is not surprising that most   or grand alliances either do not last their terms or provide ineffective governance. The case of the Samyukta Vidhayak Dals in Uttar Pradesh, Janata Experiment and the recent Bihar example come to mind. The only way of ensuring a permanent defeat for Modi is not by electorally defeating him in the upcoming elections. It can be done only by exposing Modi in a way that our generation does not see the rise of such a person again, one who relies on the basest instincts of core supporters, and furthers communalism, bigotry and violence by proxy – ‘outsourcing’ these to the masses, so that the power centres can be absolved. It will be the beginning of the end for Modi when he has to sit in the Lok Sabha with 200-220 seats, having to counter one single opposition party having 100+ seats. The obvious pitfalls of ‘my way or the highway’ approach will be highlighted then, and perhaps hare-brained schemes like demonetisation will be avoided. It is important that my colleagues accept that it was a cathartic moment for many Indians when Modi became the prime minister in 2014, and I don’t see that enchantment as having faded away substantially amongst that particular section. One ought to focus on ensuring not merely Modi’s electoral defeat (from which he can most definitely recover), but to work towards his permanent political defeat. One must not allow Modi the right to complain that he is the ‘victim’ of an opportunistic alliance. He ought to be exposed as a person who got two terms as the prime minister of the world’s largest democracy but could not deliver. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Alok Prasanna Kumar,"The Information and Broadcasting Ministry’s letter to television channels to refrain from using the word ‘Dalit’ (and use ‘Scheduled Caste’ instead) is silly and legally indefensible. The ostensible basis for this is the order of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court in   which is partially extracted in the letter. It also refers to an earlier communication by the Ministry of Social Justice to other officers of the central and state government requesting them not to use the term ‘Dalit’ when they mean the constitutional term ‘Scheduled Caste’. That communication came after the   in a petition filed by one Mohanlal Mohar which seems to suggest that the Central and State Government should refrain from using ‘Dalit’ in official documents. The MP High Court merely says that “the Central Government/State Government and its functionaries would refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ for the members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as the same does not find mentioned in the Constitution of India or any statute.”[sic] The Bombay High Court on the other hand, notes that the central government has asked its officers to not use the term and on an argument made by counsel for the petitioner, asks the I&B Ministry to “consider” issuing directions to the media regarding the use of “Dalit”. There’s nothing here which suggests that the media be asked to refrain from using this word. While at first glance the MP High Court and the Bombay High Court’s orders may make some sense – after all the Constitution itself does not use the word ‘Dalit’ and one wouldn’t want to cause conceptual confusion – it appears absurd when we realise how often constitutional courts themselves use the term ‘Dalit’ in their judgments. A survey of the Supreme Court cases database tells us that the Supreme Court first used the term ‘Dalit’ (outside the title of the case) in 1975, uttered by Justice VR Krishna Iyer when he made a reference to ‘Dalit panthers’ in  . Since then, its use has only increased in the Supreme Court and no fewer than 50 Supreme Court judgments have used the term. Ironically enough, the first High Court to use the term (outside the name of a person) is the Madhya Pradesh High Court in   in 1943, where the meaning of the term is also explained in the judgment to refer to communities then referred to as “depressed classes”. However, the widespread use of the term in judgments only took place in the 80s, as with the Supreme Court. If the Madhya Pradesh and the Bombay High Courts’ orders were to be applied liberally, should the Supreme Court and other High Courts also be directed to stop using the word ‘Dalit’? And should older judgments be erased and re-written for having committed the mortal sin of having used a term that a community chooses to identify itself with, than with a constitutional classification? For the purposes of the freedom of religion under Article 25, “Hindus” and “Hindu religious institutions” includes Sikh, Jaina and Buddhist religious institutions. Should we therefore call the Golden Temple in Amritsar a Hindu religious building? Should the Dalai Lama be considered a Hindu for official purposes? One other way to see these orders is to also see them as part of the increasing trend where constitutional courts, far from being the forum to defend and protect rights, are becoming “ ” and finding new and dangerous ways of restricting individual rights. From media gags at the drop of a hat to imprisoning Hadiya ignoring her pleas, we are seeing the distressing phenomenon of courts going out of their way to limit the rights of individuals. Both the High Court orders relating to the use of the word ‘Dalit’ are singularly unreasonable and do not stand the slightest of scrutiny. They are entirely casual about what they are saying and the impact of what they are saying. They are the result of judges and courts in India getting too used to over-extending their powers in the name of “public interest” with scant regard for law, procedure, or even common sense. In as much as the Information and Broadcasting Ministry deserves ridicule for this silly “advisory”, the High Courts need to be called into question for their indefensible behaviour in the guise of performing “judicial function”.

Chitranshul Sinha,"There once was a business tycoon who tried to silence critics of his businesses, and educational institutions run by his organisation. They filed suits for defamation against their critics in places like Delhi, Assam, Dehradun etc, and made the defendants run from one court to another to defend themselves. The damage was done by then though, as the punishment is in the procedure rather than the verdict. IIPM and Arindam Chaudhary ensured that the defendants bled money and resources, and deterred others from criticising them. Recently, Reliance Defence, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Aerostructure filed a defamation suit claiming Rs 5,000 Crores in damages against the Associated Journals Limited, the publisher of the  , its Editor in-Chief Zafar Agha, and Vishwadeepak who wrote an article claiming that Anil Ambani set up Reliance Defence days before the announcement of the Rafale deal by the central government. Merits of the matter apart, it is interesting to note that the suit has been filed before a civil court in Ahmedabad, which has emerged as a forum of choice for others too in the past for filing defamation suits claiming huge amounts as damages. In all such cases, the defendants reside in and operate from Delhi. Why Ahmedabad, you may ask! What is the rationale behind the choice of forum then? The reason that jumps out at us, is the amount of court fees payable on such suits. A suit claiming Rs 50 billion in damages, if it were to be filed in Delhi, had to be filed before the Delhi High Court and not any district court. The court fee payable for such a suit in the Delhi High Court will be around Rs 50 million. Compare this to the court fees payable in Ahmedabad according to the Gujarat Court-Fees Act, 2004. The Act stipulates that irrespective of the amount of damages claimed in a suit, the court fees payable cannot exceed Rs 75,000. While this is great for persons with limited means and improves access to the justice delivery system for all sections of society, it runs the risk of being exploited unless there are safeguards in place. Usually a suit is filed wherever the defendant resides or carries on its business, or where a substantial part of the subject of dispute occurs. Taking the example of the case against  , the suit could have been filed in Delhi, where the newspaper is based, or any other place where the newspaper is circulated. In the age of digital news, the circulation of a newspaper is now not restricted to territories where it is physically distributed. It can be claimed that since   also has a digital presence, a part of cause of action against any of its articles can also arise in any place where it is accessed online. In the present case, it appears that it is claimed that cause of action arises in Ahmedabad, as people read the article in question online in Ahmedabad, thus, appearing as defamatory to their eyes. While the premise is legally tenable under the Civil Procedure Code, it has the potential to cause major physical and financial harassment for the defendants. The provision enabling filing of suits in any place where a defamatory statement is published, has not kept up with advancement in internet technology. This is where the central government needs to step in and reform the law. In accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and case laws confirming its applicability to writ petitions, High Courts usually do not entertain petitions which would have an effect of inconveniencing the parties against which a petition has been filed. Following judicial precedents, High Courts first examine whether a substantial part of the cause of action arises within its territorial jurisdiction or not. If the answers are in the negative, the petitioner would be asked to institute the petition before the High Court with territorial jurisdiction over the more substantial part of cause of action, or where the contesting respondents are physically located. This doctrine should also be applied in cases of civil suits in cases such as the defamation suit against  . The central government could bring in the principle of forum non conveniens into the Civil Procedure Code by making appropriate amendments to its provisions. Another safeguard which could be employed to avoid exploitation of the cap on court fees could be making the plaintiff justify the valuation of the amount claimed as damages before summons in the suit are issued to the defendants. The plaintiff could be asked to provide proof of actual losses suffered to enable the court to reach a prima facie decision on the correctness of the valuation. Unless the central government steps in to make the necessary amendments to the Civil Procedure Code, suits claiming damages for defamation will continue to have a chilling effect on free speech.

Akanksha Kumar,"Ashutosh Bhardwaj & Sandeep Suman A Facebook post by two boys from an upper-caste community in Rajasthan has sparked caste tensions in Barmer’s Kaludi village between themselves and Dalits. On 28 July, a status update posted by two boys belonging to the Rajpurohit community went viral. The post used a set of gun emojies, and used a casteist slur for the Meghwal community. “Give up the Jai Bhim slogan or give up your life”, read the post, which was soon shared by other Rajpurohit community members as they began tagging each other and commenting on it. “We had ignored their posts on social media,” says Arvind Meghwal, who had gone to Kota that day for Rajasthan’s LDC (Lower Division Clerk) recruitment exam. He is a resident of Kaludi village. But in the world of social media, a viral post spreads like fire. Within a few days of the post going viral, a man named Rawataram, from the Meghwal community, filed an FIR at the Balotra police station that resulted in two arrests. This irked the Rajpurohits, who called for a panchayat and, Kaludi’s Meghwals claim, announced that they were formally ostracising 70 Dalit families belonging to the Meghwal community. “  (restriction from food and water)”, essentially meaning that the Meghwals from Kaludi village have been barred from: This act of ostracisation, though far from unheard of in Rajasthan, has provoked fresh anger among the Dalits.

Under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act 2015, social and economic boycott is a punishable offence with a prison term of six months, that can extend up to five years, along with a fine. Following arrests by the police over the social boycott, the Rajpurohits have allegedly been venting their ire against the Meghwals for “taking a Facebook post too seriously”. Meghwals claim that the Rajpurohits have been issuing threats to them after they sought police protection. As a show of strength, the Meghwal community organised a rally in Balotra village, the  on 9 September 2018.

Aastha Gulati,"Last week, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued an advisory to the media, asking them to refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ for people belonging to Scheduled Castes. This directive from the Centre directly follows the legal battle waged by activist, Pankaj Meshram who, in June this year, had filed a public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court asking to remove the word ‘Dalit’ from the public discourse and replace it instead with the more constitutional term, ‘Scheduled Caste’. In light of these controversies, the question that should be asked is, why is the word ‘Dalit’ in the eye of the storm now? Why is it contentious for the term ‘Dalit’ to be part of the public discourse? Dalit, used in a similar manner as ‘Blacks’ in the US, has been used by the community as a symbolic reassertion of identity and struggle against an oppressive, caste-ridden society. The position and the history of Dalits themselves can be traced through the names used for them. This history is semantic, political, and social all at once, and has provided a unifying force to an oppressed community. Broadly, the history of this contentious word can be traced back to the 1930s. Dr. Anand Teltumbde told  that it was Maharashtrian reformer Jyotirao Phule who first used the word  At the time, it was used as a Hindi/Marathi translation for ‘depressed classes’, as academic scholar Gail Omvedt points out in her  The colonial government used to use the term ‘Scheduled Caste’, which was just a reflection of the legal category they belonged to, but this was not a term which lent itself to political speech. By the time Ambedkar entered politics, he used   to refer to a large class of people at the bottom of the caste hierarchy. It was around this time that the Poona Pact was signed. Mahatma Gandhi had insisted that Dalits be given representation, but within the Hindu fold, while Ambedkar demanded a separate electorate. Gandhi chose to call Dalits  or children of god –– but this was a term that did not find favour within the community. Dalit thinkers and revolutionaries, Ambedkar included, have rejected the term Harijan to describe themselves on accounts of it being condescending. Historian Ramachandra Guha  By the 1970s, under the backdrop of caste atrocity and lack of political representation, Dalit as a term began to acquire a political meaning. ‘Dalit’ literature began to use the term for people of all castes and communities and academics began to use it to highlight the history of those who had been historically oppressed. At the forefront of the new assertive movement were the Dalit Panthers, a prominent activist group who played a key role in making the term a self-chosen one. Dr. Eleanor Zelliot, a pioneer of Western studies of Dr BR Ambedkar, describes the phenomenon in her paper  With an increasing awareness of a separate Dalit political identity in 1980s, groups and political parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party emerged, anchoring their politics on the Dalit vote-base. The Ministry’s directive against usage of the word Dalit in the media has come in for strong criticism. According to Teltumbde, it is both unnecessary and malicious: Social scientist, Satish Deshpande, talking to  , agreed that it is a non-issue, and questions the need for such a move. In his opinion, the history behind the word is what’s at play.  also looks at how the substitution of Dalit with ‘Scheduled Caste’ neutralises everything it has come to mean over the years. ‘Scheduled Caste’ is a legal term, and is hence ideologically neutral. However, for those who suffer the realities of caste oppression, a stronger and assertive identity is required –– something the neutral legal terminology cannot provide.  On the other hand, ‘Dalit’, with its historic connotations of resistance, can provide that, according to her. A term pregnant with meaning and history stands at risk of erasure thanks to the new directive, a term which should only be more important today, in light of the wider protests against the Supreme Court’s modification of the SC/ST Act. Surely the social and political self-identification of Dalits should be worth more than some overreaching subservience to legal nomenclature. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

BloombergQuint,"The SIDBI run credit guarantee scheme for medium and small enterprises is a growing contingent liability and needs to be examined with urgency, former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said in a 17-page note to India’s Parliamentary Estimates Committee. Rajan has expounded on the reasons that led to a large build up of non-performing assets in India’s banking system, the regulator’s actions and what needs to be done to prevent a recurrence. It is in detailing that last point that Rajan has raised the flag on current vulnerabilities. Launched in 2000 the CGTMSE, now known as UDAAN, has recorded over 25 lakh cumulative guarantee approvals in 2016-17 with an aggregate loan amount of over Rs 1.25 lakh crore, according to information on its website. Suggesting that the government should refrain from setting ambitious credit targets or waiving loans, Rajan reiterated that loan waivers vitiate credit culture and stress state budgets. When discussing why NPAs continue to mount despite an extensive asset quality review conducted when he was governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Rajan said as NPAs age they need more provisioning and that “a fair amount of the increase in NPAs may be due to ageing rather than as a result of a fresh lot of NPAs”. Risk averse bankers and governments that drag their feet are why projects have not yet revived, Rajan said. He also observed that the bankruptcy process is being tested by the large promoters, with continuous and sometimes frivolous appeals. Pointing out the obvious, that the judicial system is not equipped to deal with every bad loan, Rajan said much loan renegotiation should be done under the shadow of the Bankruptcy Court, not in it. Rajan has offered several suggestions on how such a NPA recurrence can be avoided. Among them, he urged the government to adopt a new approach to NPA resolution, cautioning against old ideas such as bad banks and mergers. The parliamentary panel, headed by BJP’s Murali Manohar Joshi, has been tasked with identifying the reasons behind India’s nearly Rs 9 lakh crore bad loan pile. The panel had invited Rajan to brief on the matter after former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian praised him for his work on identifying the crisis and speeding up recognition of stressed assets. A larger number of bad loans were originated in the period 2006-2008 when economic growth was strong, and previous infrastructure projects such as power plants had been completed on time and within budget. It is at such times that banks make mistakes. They extrapolate past growth and performance to the future. So they are willing to accept higher leverage in projects, and less promoter equity. Indeed, sometimes banks signed up to lend based on project reports by the promoter’s investment bank, without doing their own due diligence. One promoter told me about how he was pursued then by banks waving checkbooks, asking him to name the amount he wanted. This is the historic phenomenon of irrational exuberance, common across countries at such a phase in the cycle. Unfortunately, growth does not always take place as expected. The years of strong global growth before the global financial crisis were followed by a slowdown, which extended even to India, showing how much more integrated we had become with the world. Strong demand projections for various projects were shown to be increasingly unrealistic as domestic demand slowed down. A variety of governance problems such as the suspect allocation of coal mines coupled with the fear of investigation slowed down government decision making in Delhi, both in the UPA and the subsequent NDA governments. Project cost overruns escalated for stalled projects and they became increasingly unable to service debt. The continuing travails of the stranded power plants, even though India is short of power, suggests government decision making has not picked up sufficient pace to date. Once projects got delayed enough that the promoter had little equity left in the project, he lost interest. Ideally, projects should be restructured at such times, with banks writing down bank debt that is uncollectable, and promoters bringing in more equity, under the threat that they would otherwise lose their project. Unfortunately, until the Bankruptcy Code was enacted, bankers had little ability to threaten promoters (see later), even incompetent or unscrupulous ones, with loss of their project. Writing down the debt was then simply a gift to promoters, and no banker wanted to take the risk of doing so and inviting the attention of the investigative agencies. Stalled projects continued as “zombie” projects, neither dead nor alive (“zombie” is a technical term used in the banking literature). How important was malfeasance and corruption in the NPA problem? Undoubtedly, there was some, but it is hard to tell banker exuberance, incompetence, and corruption apart. Clearly, bankers were overconfident and probably did too little due diligence for some of these loans. Many did no independent analysis, and placed excessive reliance on SBI Caps and IDBI to do the necessary due diligence. Such outsourcing of analysis is a weakness in the system, and multiplies the possibilities for undue influence. Banker performance after the initial loans were made were also not up to the mark. Unscrupulous promoters who inflated the cost of capital equipment through over-invoicing were rarely checked. Public sector bankers continued financing promoters even while private sector banks were getting out, suggesting their monitoring of promoter and project health was inadequate. Too many bankers put yet more money for additional “balancing” equipment, even though the initial project was heavily underwater, and the promoter’s intent suspect. Finally, too many loans were made to well-connected promoters who have a history of defaulting on their loans. Yet, unless we can determine the unaccounted wealth of bankers, I hesitate to say a significant element was corruption. Rather than attempting to hold bankers responsible for specific loans, I think bank boards and investigative agencies must look for a pattern of bad loans that bank CEOs were responsible for – some banks went from healthy to critically undercapitalized under the term of a single CEO. Then they must look for unaccounted assets with that CEO. Only then should there be a presumption that there was corruption. The size of frauds in the public sector banking system have been increasing, though still small relative to the overall volume of NPAs. Frauds are different from normal NPAs in that the loss is because of a patently illegal action, by either the borrower or the banker. Unfortunately, the system has been singularly ineffective in bringing even a single high profile fraudster to book. As a result, fraud is not discouraged. The AQR was meant to stop the ever-greening and concealment of bad loans, and force banks to revive stalled projects. The hope was that once the mass of bad loans were disclosed, the banks, with the aid of the government, would undertake the surgery that was necessary to put the projects back on track. Unfortunately, this process has not played out as well. As NPAs age, they require more provisioning, so projects that have not been revived simply add to the stock of gross NPAs. A fair amount of the increase in NPAs may be due to ageing rather than as a result of a fresh lot of NPAs. Why have projects not been revived? Since the post-AQR process took place after I demitted office, I can only comment on this from press reports. Blame probably lies on all sides here. That said, the judicial process is simply not equipped to handle every NPA through a bankruptcy process. Bankruptcy Court should be a final threat, and much loan renegotiation should be done under the shadow of the Bankruptcy Court, not in it. This requires fixing the factors mentioned in (a) that make bankers risk averse and in (b) that make promoters uncooperative. We need concentrated attention by a high level empowered and responsible group set up by government on cleaning up the banks. Otherwise the same non-solutions (bad bank, management teams to take over stressed assets, bank mergers, new infrastructure lending institution) keep coming up and nothing really moves. Public sector banks are losing market share as non-bank finance companies, the private sector banks, and some of the newly licensed banks are expanding. It is hard to offer an objective self-assessment. However, the RBI should probably have raised more flags about the quality of lending in the early days of banking exuberance. With the benefit of hindsight, we should probably not have agreed to forbearance, though without the tools to clean up, it is not clear what the banks would have done. Forbearance was a bet that growth would revive, and projects would come back on track. Also, we should have initiated the new tools earlier, and pushed for a more rapid enactment of the Bankruptcy Code. If so, we could have started the AQR process earlier. Finally, the RBI could have been more decisive in enforcing penalties on non-compliant banks. Fortunately, this culture of leniency has been changing in recent years. Hindsight, of course, is 20/20. Both the out of court restructuring process and the bankruptcy process need to be strengthened and made speedy. The former requires protecting the ability of bankers to make commercial decisions without subjecting them to inquiry. The latter requires steady modifications where necessary to the bankruptcy code so that it is effective, transparent, and not gamed by unscrupulous promoters. Credit targets are sometimes achieved by abandoning appropriate due diligence, creating the environment for future NPAs. Both MUDRA loans as well as the Kisan Credit Card, while popular, have to be examined more closely for potential credit risk. The Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSME (CGTMSE) run by SIDBI is a growing contingent liability and needs to be examined with urgency. Loan waivers, as RBI has repeatedly argued, vitiate the credit culture, and stress the budgets of the waiving state or central government. They are poorly targeted, and eventually reduce the flow of credit. Agriculture needs serious attention, but not through loan waivers. An all-party agreement to this effect would be in the nation’s interest, especially given the impending elections. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Ashutosh,"Who is the real MA Jinnah? Jinnah, who single handedly created Pakistan or, the man who fiery nationalist and friend Sarojini Naidu called “the apostle of Hindu Muslim unity”? Who is the real Jinnah, the man who never wore his Muslim identity on his sleeve, or the one, in 1940, who decided to demand that Muslims should have their own sovereign republic called Pakistan? Who is the real Jinnah? The man who almost became the top leader of India in 1916-17, or the man who was lost in anonymity and left India to practice law in London in the 1920s? Who is the real Jinnah, the man who seemed humourless and emotionless or the man who was madly in love with his wife, Ruttei? Jinnah will always remain an enigmatic figure in history. He is once again in news in India, but for the wrong reason. At a time when nationalism is the flavour of the season, Jinnah’s portrait in Aligarh Muslim University is causing a lot of angst. Obviously, the so-called nationalists do not like it and will see to it that the issue is stoked to the point that it can help the Hindutva brigade polarise some votes in the 2019 elections. Jinnah is the reason for the mayhem on the campus of Aligarh Muslim University. The police had to resort to lathicharge due to communal tension in the campus and its vicinity. There is no denying the fact Jinnah, for the hyper nationalists, is a hate figure, perceived to be the creator of an evil empire called Pakistan, and a man who wanted India to bleed to death. Jinnah was seven years younger to Gandhi and ironically, both belonged to Gujarat and were proud Kathiawaris. Despite his youth, his stature was considered to be at par with the top leaders of the freedom movement, like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Moti Lal Nehru, Phiroze Shah Mehta, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, CR Das, Madan Mohan Malviya, etc. Gokhale was the tallest of all leaders. He was fond of both Gandhi and Jinnah. He used to say: When Gandhi gave a call to oppose the draconian Rowlatt Act, Jinnah supported him and resigned from the legislature. It was a huge setback for the British. Sir George Lloyd, the then Governor of Bombay, was of the opinion that “Jinnah was the most dangerous Indian leader and his political influence should be curtailed.” Before Gandhi’s arrival, the freedom movement was constrained by constitutionalism; Congress as a party was, more or less, a pressure group. Though leaders like Tilak were toying with the idea of a mass movement, but it was Gandhi who succeeded in igniting the collective consciousness of India’s population. Gandhi made the cause of independence a mass movement, and revolt against the Rowlatt act was a first step in that direction. Jinnah felt that the Khilafat/anti-Rowlatt movement had religious overtones. Moreover, he was also not happy with Gandhi’s patronising attitude. But Gandhi, by the turn of 1920, had attained sainthood in the eyes of the people. For his followers, opposition to Gandhi was blasphemous and Jinnah committed that blunder. He decided to oppose Gandhi’s resolution for non-cooperation in Kolkata’s special session of the Congress party. He was hooted and was almost beaten up by angry followers. But Jinnah was also stubborn. In the Nagpur session, he yet again failed to read the mood of the people and that was the end of his political career which he had carefully crafted for 23 years. He was down and out, and Gandhi became the monarch of the freedom struggle. Defeat was painful for Jinnah. His ambition to emerge as the topmost leader of India was shattered. Finally, he decided to move to England and retired from politics for a few year. When he came back in 1934, he was not the same person. His wife Ruttei death at a very young age left him more “self-centred”. When he was called by his Muslim friends to return to India, he was there to protect the “ ”. He returned to India as the permanent president of the Muslim League. For him, the Congress was now a Hindu party. In the Lucknow session of the Muslim League in 1937, Jinnah, “for the first time appeared in a long coat and loose trousers of the Indian Muslims, and not in his well cut European suit.” Jinnah, who hated Gandhi in his loin cloth, was now a Muslim leader. Gandhi was deeply pained to hear Jinnah’s Lucknow speech. For him, it was a “declaration of war”, and he his expressed his true feelings to Jinnah in a letter. Jinnah wrote back calling his stand only an instrument of “self-defence”. Gandhi reminded Jinnah about his past and asked, “In your speeches I miss the old nationalist... are you still the same Mr Jinnah?” Jinnah was very bitter. From now on, the demand for a separate sovereign state for Muslims was just a formality. In 1940 in the Lahore session of the Muslim league, a resolution was passed and it was declared that Hindu and Muslims were two different nations and could not live together. Gandhi refused to carry this line and pleaded that Hindus and Muslims were not two nations, but part of the same civilisation. But Jinnah had gone too far and conciliation was not possible. But millions of people from either side were butchered and the world witnessed the biggest-ever human migration in 1947. When India got independence, the world was gloomy. After 70 years of independence, we are still fighting in his name. It’s not a good sign. (       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Saket Suman,"Historian Ramachandra Guha, who has penned a monumental 1,100-page biography of Mahatma Gandhi, says that he finds double standards in the respect that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), accord to the Father of the Nation nowadays. ""The RSS particularly is very ambivalent about Gandhi. When Gandhi was alive, the RSS actively disliked him. They were absolutely opposed to equal rights for Muslims. In their list of heroes, Gandhi ranks very low... Through the 50s and 60s, they paid very less attention to him and his teachings. From the late 60s onwards, his name started appearing in their programmes,"" Guha told IANS in an interview here. His book, ""Gandhi: The Years That Changed The World"" charts Gandhi's story from the time he left South Africa to his dramatic assassination in 1948. ""There are clearly some aspects of Gandhi's philosophies that are unacceptable to the RSS. And Mr (Narendra) Modi may have picked them up as an RSS worker. Today, he invokes Gandhi from time to time but it is not clear whether it is instrumental, tactical, or a clear departure from how the Sangh Parivar views Gandhi. At best, I would say that the Sangh Parivar views Gandhi with ambivalence, and when he was alive they did just the same,"" said the 60-year-old historian, known for highly acclaimed books such as ""India after Gandhi"" and ""Gandhi Before India"". In the last section of his book, Guha notes that the RSS and the BJP profess respect for Gandhi in public in the context of his formal standing as the Father of the Nation. He noted that most of the attacks on Gandhi on social media today come from the Hindu-right. Guha said that Gandhi would particularly be ""disappointed by polarisation of religious sentiments"" and ""the victimisation of minorities"". The St. Stephens graduate, however, noted that Gandhi's philosophies and values are alive in many social, environmental and feminist movements. ""His philosophies are alive in many citizen-action programmes but certainly not in politics,"" he maintained. Guha said that there was no particular pull for the historian in chronicling Gandhi's life in such detail, and with extensive research that demanded sourcing archival materials from museums and libraries in several countries, apart from the fact that ""for any historian of modern India, Gandhi is certainly the most influential and most controversial figure"". He shared that even in his earlier works on the environmental movement and India's democracy, Gandhi's influence was visible. ""Essentially, it is a detailed account of Gandhi's life, based on some rare archival records. I learnt a lot myself about Gandhi, his times and our country during the course of researching and writing this book and I hope younger readers will also learn something from it,"" Guha said. The book is due to be released on September 11 in the Capital. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi on Monday, 10 September failed to get any relief from the Delhi High Court which dismissed their challenge on reopening of their tax assessments for the year 2011-12. The rejection of the pleas of the top Congress leaders, including Oscar Fernandes, will pave the way for the Income Tax Department to scrutinise their records for the assessment year 2011-12. ""...the assessees' rights to urge them are reserved in the income tax proceedings,"" it said, while ""dismissing"" the three separate petitions which were decided through a common order. The income tax probe against the Congress leaders has arisen from the investigation into the private criminal complaint filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy before a trial court in connection with the National Herald case. A tax evasion petition (TEP) was also addressed to the finance minister by Swamy. It was alleged that YI, which was incorporated in November 2010 with a capital of Rs 50 lakh, had acquired almost all shareholdings of the AJL, which was running the National Herald newspaper. In this process, YI had also acquired AJL's debt of Rs 90 crore. It has already issued a demand notice for Rs 249.15 crore to YI for the assessment year 2011-12. The department's move followed its probe on a complaint alleging that the Gandhis had misappropriated AJL's assets while transferring their shares to the newly formed YI. The bench, in its Monday order, noted that the premise of the reassessment notices was that the non-disclosure of the taxing event - allotment of shares of YI - deprived the assessing officer of the opportunity to look into the records. It said that in Rahul's case, the non-disclosure of share acquisition constituted tangible material justifying reassessment. In case of Sonia and Oscar, the bench said returns filed by them were processed under Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act, which pertains to 'Notice or intimation', and are not treated as ""assessments"".

Bhanu Dhamija,"Even after 71 years, the anger and pain of Partition haunts us. In India we have mostly settled on blaming Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In Pakistan, the blame is just as easily placed on Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. But the truth is that, Partition befell our nation because all these leaders weren’t able to envision a Constitution for a free India that was fair to   Hindus and Muslims. This clash seemed insurmountable in 1947, and to this day it is the chief cause of hostility between the two communities. Majority-rule and democracy became synonymous to most Indians during the freedom struggle. They imagined free India to function as a British parliamentary democracy, which is a system of majority-rule. In that system the party in the majority runs the Government while the minority bides its time as the Opposition. Indians failed to realise that in Britain, parties were not religiously divided, but structured along social or economic ideologies. In 1941, British constitutional scholar Sir Ivor Jennings had cautioned about this crucial difference. “With us, the majority is not permanent,” he wrote. “It is based upon differing views of personal and national interest, views which are susceptible to change and do change from time to time. This important fact must not be forgotten, for it enables the minority to submit peacefully and even cheerfully to the fulfilment of the policy of the majority... A Conservative Government might persuade me to become a conservative overnight, but it cannot change my ancestry, my language, my tribe or caste, my religion, or even my economic status.” Both the Congress party and Muslim League entered elections under the 1935 Government of India Act, which reserved seats in provincial legislatures on a religious basis. They had a tacit understanding, and avoided direct contest in several Muslim constituencies. Congress however, under the leadership of Nehru, won a huge majority. The League didn’t win even Punjab or Bengal, where Muslims were in the majority. Of the 492 seats designated “Muslim” under the 1935 Act’s Communal Award, the League won only 109. Following the parliamentary practice, Congress decided to form governments entirely of its own in provinces where it was the largest party. Majority parties in other provinces did the same. As a result, the League’s winning candidates weren’t asked to join in any government. What made matters worse for the League was that Congress also embarked on a massive program to woo Muslims. Nehru declared, “It is for us now to… rid this country of communalism in every shape and form.” Muslim leaders began to paint Congress’ refusal to form coalition governments as a breach of faith. The League launched a propaganda campaign to shore up its core constituency, raising the “Islam in danger” cry. Jinnah publicly appealed to Gandhi to do something about the growing Hindu-Muslim hostility, but Gandhi seemed powerless. Since the Muslim minority status was never going to change in India, it was forever doomed to sit in Opposition. Pakistan, which until now was merely an academic thesis, all of a sudden became a rallying point. BS Rao, chronicler of India’s freedom struggle and member of its Constituent Assembly, wrote, “in 1937 there was singularly little support for the establishment of Pakistan… and in three years the political scene in India underwent a radical transformation.” Before committing to Pakistan however, Jinnah tried to make it clear that the real issue was the parliamentary system’s majority-rule. He had the League pass a resolution in 1939 declaring that it was “irrevocably opposed to… a majority community rule under the guise of democracy and a parliamentary system of government.”  In 1940, the League passed the Pakistan Resolution. For the next seven years, the Indians and British clamoured to find a solution that could satisfy Jinnah by sharing some powers. But since all proposals devised a central government of a parliamentary type under majority control, no progress was made. Remarkably, even the League’s own proposal in 1940 went only so far as safeguarding provincial sovereignty and minority rights. It was seen as a ploy to advance its cause of a separate state of Pakistan. Similarly, in 1942, the Congress’s Quit India resolution was rejected because it only promised a constitution with “the largest measure of autonomy for the federating units.” In 1944, Rajagopalachari proposed a formula under which a province could separate from the Union. It became the basis for Gandhi-Jinnah talks. These talks broke down after only 18 days though, because Jinnah would not commit any part of Pakistan’s sovereignty to a national government. Similar was the fate of the proposals made by the Sapru Committee, BR Ambedkar, BN Rau, and many others. The last best hope arose in 1946, with the British Cabinet Mission. The three-member committee pleaded with the Indian people, “to extend their vision beyond their own community,” as it announced a plan to establish a Constituent Assembly and an Interim Government of Indians. The Mission noted that the British had “hoped that it would be possible for the Indian people themselves to agree upon the method of framing the new Constitution, [but] despite the labours which we have shared …this has not been possible.” But once again, the union government was deemed to be of a parliamentary type. The League withdrew from the plan, and the country was partitioned. India still faces the grave challenge of sharing powers between a permanent majority and minority, and balancing union and state governments. But until these fundamental issues are resolved, we cannot hope to achieve our potential of being one of the world’s great nations.

Darshan Desai,"There are some stories in Gujarat which don’t require any special investigation. Just a cursory look at the facts is sufficient. So when the Criminal Investigation Department of Gujarat Police suddenly swooped down on dismissed IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt on Wednesday, to arrest him in a 1996 case, it may not have surprised him. Only that the charge on Bhatt this time, that of framing a lawyer in a narcotics case some 22 years ago, is not as flimsy as the one that straightaway cost him his job of 27 meritorious years. His crime? ‘Unauthorised Absence From Duty’. This followed an ex-parte departmental inquiry without anyone seeking his official explanation. He has been denied his pension and other service benefits. And what was he actually doing when he was absent from duty allegedly without permission? Bhatt was deposing before the Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry appointed by none other than the Gujarat government. And what was the Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry probing? It was inquiring into the 2002 Godhra and post-Godhra communal violence in Gujarat, in which many alleged the complicity of the then Narendra Modi state government. Sanjiv Bhatt was among those. His depositions and affidavits before the Nanavati Commission, the National Commission for Minorities, and the Supreme Court contained incriminating material suggesting the state’s complicity and deliberate inaction during the 2002 violence. He was one of the first officers to report that the 27 February 2002, Godhra train burning incident could spark off possible retaliatory violence. It did happen and nearly 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the span of a week. The Gujarat Police received country-wide condemnation for not being able to prevent the largescale violence despite intelligence tip-offs.. Much later, Bhatt sparked off controversy when he claimed that at a high-level meeting on the night of 27 February 2002 at the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi’s official residence in Gandhinagar, senior police officials were told to let people vent their anger for 72 hours and avenge the Godhra train-burning incident. Bhatt’s reports and advisories as an officer in the Intelligence Bureau were presented before various commissions and courts as his evidence of state complicity and administrative inaction during 2002. The refusal of the Gujarat Police to treat this complaint as an FIR was challenged in the Supreme Court by Zakia Jafri in 2008. Besides deposing before the SIT that was inquiring into Zakia Jafri’s complaint, Bhatt also filed an exhaustive affidavit in the Supreme Court alleging attempts of the SIT in shielding the powers-that-be, including Narendra Modi. The Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court, dismissed his allegations and filed a closure report, giving a clean chit to Narendra Modi and other powerful functionaries of the state. This closure report is currently under challenge before the Gujarat High Court, and Sanjiv Bhatt remains a key witness to the alleged role and function of the state administration in the 2002 pogrom. Bhatt went to school at the Hill Grange High School in Mumbai, and is an alumnus of St Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall, in Ahmedabad. An IIT-Bombay graduate, Bhatt cleared his civil services examination with a top rank and chose the Indian Police Service (IPS) when he was 23, in 1987. He was allotted the Gujarat cadre. The demolition was carried out round-the-clock for one full week. Bhatt’s wife Shweta – who had contested elections on a Congress ticket from Maninagar in 2012 – had filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging an order of the Gujarat High Court ordering the demolition. Within an hour of the apex court rejecting the petition, the AMC team arrived with bulldozers and began razing the property. Meanwhile, at around the same time, the state government withdrew the security cover given to Sanjiv Bhatt and his family. Sanjiv Bhatt is not alone to have faced the wrath of the powers-that-be for standing up to the BJP government in Gujarat. Take two senior IPS officers of the Gujarat cadre, Inspector General of Police Satish Verma and DIG Rajnish Rai, for instance.  After Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister, Verma was shunted out as Chief Vigilance Officer in the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd, Shillong, Meghalaya, and Rai as CVO in the Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL) at Jaduguda, Jharkhand. The two have clearly stated in their petitions that they are being harassed for doing their jobs diligently.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Mayank Mishra,"Following the conclusion of the 1931 Census, J H Hutton, a celebrated anthropologist and the then census commissioner, is reported to have recommended that all future census operations should desist from collecting data on castes. He was echoing the views of all his predecessors who conducted such projects and failed miserably. Anomalies coming out of such exercises were too many. For instance, the group of upper castes, in the 1867 Census in Oudh, included Brahmins, Bengalis, Jains, Kshatriyas, Kayasths, Kashmiris and Marwaris, among others. It only goes to show that ‘caste’ meant different things to different people. After the conclusion of the 1871 Census, some British officials would complain that certain individuals would identify as Marathas when they were   from the Maratha region, some would write their   as Brahmins, when they were Brahmins by  . The practice continued till 1941 and was abandoned subsequently. The question of caste was made optional in the 1941 Census and limited data thus collected, was never published. Confusing caste with other primordial identities was not the only complication facing enumerators and respondents. From 1901 onwards, there were growing demands from several caste organisations to be accorded a status different from what was assigned by the enumerators. That was the phase of, what is called Sanskritisation, wherein people belonging to the so-called lower castes would emulate customs and practices of upper-castes, to claim membership to the higher-up groups. The data on castes coming out of census operations therefore, were found to be very inconsistent and unsatisfactory. A  “caste had a troubled presence in the pages of the census reports. No exhaustive list of castes could ever be prepared for any province, let alone for the country as a whole, every such list was completed only by adding columns named as “other castes”, “castes not specified/not known”, etc; no list was ever submitted without questions being asked whether those enlisted were really castes; no two reports on the census of India ever matched in the way these classified castes; no inventory of caste was ever compiled without the presiding census commissioner expressing misgivings about the whole project.” Noted social scientist AM Shah says that there are five words for caste in Gujarati— and . Each of them has multiple connotations, depending on the context they are used in. As a result, while an endogamous group is referred to as a caste in some context, traditional association with an occupation also comes to represent a caste.  too is seen as connoting caste. In certain contexts, surnames too can represent caste. No wonder, the latest attempt through the 2011 Socio Economic Caste Census to get a sense of the caste composition, ended in chaos. According to reliable reports, the exercise pegged the number of castes in the country at a staggering 4.6 million. This comes to an average of one caste for 72 households. Is the proposed exercise in 2021 going to be any different? Not quite, if enumerators go around collecting data with open-ended questions on caste. The only way out is to have an expert panel of sociologists and anthropologists come up with a working definition of caste. The task though is not going to be an easy one. Caste is as much a social reality as it is a marker of relative deprivation of a group of people. Take a look at the complexity of the caste matrix in the country. The National Commission for Backward Classes compiles and updates a list of backward castes for all the states. For instance, Bihar, according to the commission’s list, has many as 136 OBC categories and Karnataka has 199 such categories. Then there are separate lists prepared by respective state governments. The combined number of OBCs alone, based on reports of the national as well as state commissions, would run into several thousands. Any expert panel thus constituted, will have to go through all the names, see the characteristics and then arrive at a working definition of who are the other backward classes. Enumerators will then have to be trained accordingly. Can something like this be done along with the census? Very unlikely. The government, however, will still do it. And we will end up with grossly inconsistent data contributing very little to the existing scholarship on OBCs.

The Quint,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Monday, 10 September, tweeted two separate infographics – on petrol and diesel retail selling prices in Delhi – titled ‘Truth of Hike in Petroleum Prices’ to show the rate of fuel price hike over the years. However, BJP’s graphs depict a fall in petrol and diesel prices instead of an increase. In the graph for petrol, the rate at which petrol prices have surged has increased by 13 percent between 2014 and 2018, which is a drop in the rate when compared to the jump between 2009 to 2014 at 75.8 percent. However, instead of clearly depicting the drop in ‘rate’, the graph shows a drop in absolute ‘prices’, which is obviously wrong – the bar showing the price being Rs 80.73 is ACTUALLY lower than the one which lists Rs 40.62 as the price for petrol. Similarly, in the graph on diesel prices, the BJP has again indicated a decrease in the hike percentage from 2014 to 2018 by showing a drop in the price bar – when in reality, diesel prices have risen to Rs 72.83 from Rs 56.71. In an hour’s time, the Congress “fixed” the BJP's faulty graph, with a rectified bar graph showing the actual fuel price hike. Further, the Congress' graph also makes a nuanced comparison by including the Indian Basket Crude Oil prices for the respective years. Here, it is clear that throughout the UPA regime, the oil prices have risen in tandem with the international crude oil prices. However, the oil price hike from 2014 to 2018 has seen an increase of 13%, despite a 34% fall in international crude oil price. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Cyril Almeida,"Look at what Imran Khan said at the remembrance ceremony. See who the PTI has left to twist in the wind, again. Behold the embarrassment of the dam-water debate. But, for now, on to different things. Because the mistakes are now piling up, it’s easier to sketch out what’s going wrong. Governance — that loose, woolly term that means something different to everyone — is off-track, and it’s because of two disconnects. The first is between Imran and Asad Umar, the PM-FM symbiosis and closeness that’s missing. It is the PM-FM relationship on which all functional government or lack thereof is built, and it’s easy enough to explain why. Because government is essentially about money, and in Pakistan, government is always about   having money. That’s where the PM-FM relationship comes in: the finance guy is the adult in the room who has to have the ability to both tell his PM, usually on a child-like high with big ideas and no plans, what can be done, and make sure the PM listens to him, at least somewhat. Inevitably, that puts a strain on the PM-FM relationship in office — no PM likes to be told no, certainly not a Pakistani PM and definitely not Imran — and so going into their jobs, there needs to be a rock solid understanding between the PM and the FM. Either the PM has to know deep down, and accept that he doesn’t really know much about numbers, or the FM has to have the trust of his boss, that the FM has the same vision and agenda as the PM – that they soar or sink together. We can’t really be sure yet if he actually knows his finance and numbers. But in the ‘dam talk’ you can see that numbers to Imran is about belief — if you want the impossible, start by believing. Probably not the best place to start in matters of finance and in Imran’s case worsened, likely, by the hospital and all the fundraising he’s done over the years. Still, not automatically and necessarily an immediate disaster — if there’s a strong FM around. There isn’t. The numbers, when Asad Umar reveals them to Imran, will impose their own straitjacket — government is about money; that there is none available, how difficult it is to raise more and how impossible it is to actually spend less. Imran, of course, is larger-than-life, and a leader no one in his party can think to control or meaningfully restrain. Yet, for all the public respect and consideration between Imran and Asad, there’s always been a coolness discernible. Much has always been made of Asad, along with Shah Mehmood, seeing himself, or being thought of, as prime-minister-in-waiting. Whether the PM suspects that or the FM believes that, it’s equally dangerous to the PM-FM dynamic — either the boss suspects you of disloyalty or you think the boss is a dunce. Either way, not a good place to be. It’s easy to make too much of the dynamic — the last chap who ruled had a financial sidekick who was trusted entirely, and maybe a bit too much. The sidekick delivered initial macro stability, but then undid it all with kooky, dated economic ideas. But with weakness in the obvious, initial chain of governance, the PM-FM nexus, Imran’s capriciousness and executive novice-ness has allowed indiscipline and lack of direction to break out early across government. You can’t see a JKT or Aleem Khan having allowed things to slip so quickly. The other disconnect is systemic. It is now transparently obvious that 2018 has been first and foremost about keeping one chap out and, as a result, bringing another chap in. That has created multiple distortions, many effects of which were predictable and that are quickly becoming apparent. Because Imran is discovering all of this for the first time, it’s looking like ‘amateur hour’ to most others. Imran probably thinks he’ll get to grips with them quickly enough. But the dependencies and constraints don’t grow easier with time, they grow more insistent and pinch harder. And because of what they are rooted in, what 2018 has been about, it’s not obvious that Imran can ever overcome them — even if he really wants to, and does he really want to? Governance is already off-track but that doesn’t mean disaster is inevitable – at least not yet. Imran’s base will stay with him, no matter. The noise is now deafening, but a few things will get done — especially once the financial straitjacket is imposed and reality sinks in. Just expect a lot of drama along the way. Then again, when has Pakistan not had drama? (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"The Bombay High Court on Monday, 10 September, dismissed petitions challenging the discharge of top cops DG Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh Amin in connection with the Sohrabuddin Shaikh case. The court was expected to pronounce its verdict on whether or not some senior Gujarat and Rajasthan police officers deserve to be discharged in the 2005-2006 encounter case of the suspected gangster, his wife and their aide. Shaikh, his wife Kausar Bi and their aide Tulsiram Prajapati were killed in ""fake"" encounters by the police of the two states in 2005-2006, according to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On 16 July, a single bench of the high court, presided over by Justice A M Badar, had reserved the verdict on five revision applications challenging the discharge granted in the case by a trial court to Gujarat IPS officer Rajkumar Pandian, former Gujarat ATS chief D G Vanzara, Gujarat police officer N K Amin, Rajasthan cadre IPS officer Dinesh M N and Rajasthan police constable Dalpat Singh Rathod. Justice Badar had been conducting hearings on a daily basis since 4 July on the five revision pleas filed by Sohrabuddin Shaikh's brother Rubabuddin Shaikh and the CBI. Rubabuddin Shaikh had filed three of these five pleas, challenging the discharge granted in the case by the trial court to Pandian, Dinesh and Vanzara. The remaining two pleas were filed by the CBI challenging the discharge granted to Amin and Rathod. The Gujarat Police had then claimed Sohrabuddin Shaikh had terror links. Between 2014 and 2017, a special court in Mumbai, where the case was shifted from Gujarat following a Supreme Court order, discharged 15 of these 38 accused. Those discharged included 14 police officials and BJP president Amit Shah. As per the CBI charge sheet, Sohrabuddin Shaikh, a suspected gangster based in Gujarat, and Kausar Bi were abducted by officers of the Gujarat ATS and the Rajasthan Police from near Hyderabad, and killed in a fake encounter in November 2005. Prajapati, an eye-witness to these killings, was shot dead in another staged encounter in December 2006 by some Rajasthan Police officials at the behest of the Gujarat and Rajasthan officers, who had been involved in the killing of the husband-wife duo, the CBI had claimed. Justice Badar also conducted a separate hearing on a discharge plea filed by Gujarat IPS officer Vipul Aggarwal. A co-accused in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh encounter case, Aggarwal's discharge plea was rejected by the trial court in 2017. He then approached the HC challenging the order, seeking parity with the others who have been discharged. The verdict in Aggarwal's case is also likely to be pronounced Monday, 10 September. The encounter cases of Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Kausar Bi, and Prajapati were clubbed together in 2013 after the apex curt directed that the trial be shifted to Mumbai from Gujarat.

Arshie Qureshi ,"A prevalent but hidden subterranean conflict in Kashimiri society today is that of identities as hierarchies. Each one of us carries a multiple, potentially contradictory identity, and which of them we bring to the fore and identify with, depends on societal expectations. With patriarchy holding sway, the transgenders in Kashmir have most often been excluded from the structure and have had to invent themes and ways of inclusion in the society. Sighting a transgender at a wedding is not uncommon in Kashmir. The extravagance is in fact incomplete without them singing and dancing. Special care is taken to please them because if they get upset, they might curse the newlyweds. While they grace the weddings of others, their right to such bliss is unacceptable to society and the law.  So what do they do when they are not singing and dancing in a marriage ceremony? No one knows and no one seems to care either. The only response they get on streets, in buses and everywhere else is ugly stares and eye rolling. The crossdressers are invited to perform during religious ceremonies from time to time, the tradition believed to have come from Afghanistan. Otherwise, so narrow is their visibility, that at a public event, a transgender claimed that they had seen the dead body of one of their fellows on the road, without anyone coming forward to help with the burial rites. They live, they die, and society at large chooses to remain oblivious. But unlike in many other parts of the country, one doesn’t find them at singing at traffic signals in Kashmir, as has been portrayed by mainstream media. They keep away from the public eye. Coming out of the closet is the toughest part, and the first response to their coming out is often either abandonment, or forced counselling by religious leaders. Similarly, those who intend to come out as lesbian or gay, have other identities that they need to keep intact, for example, that of a son who must settle down with a woman and be the dominant partner. The only time when I heard about lesbians in Kashmir was during my college days, when, apparently a quarrel between two lesbians turned bloody. Everyone in the college was talking about it, but with a sense of disbelief and disregard. Parents then were inclined to sending their daughters to all-women’s colleges. The college had no way of dealing with the problem except hushing up the “rumours”. That is precisely how society negates their existence too. Within the college, however, the rumours stayed for sometime, with all curious to know more about who these students were and more importantly. Some said that their parents were called to handle their “problem”, others said that they were suspended. It was found out soon after, that the incarcerated women were actively involved in sports; this confirmed the belief of many, that they indeed were lesbians. The college gym was seen as a ‘lesbian hangout’, and was thus, avoided by many. Singledom is not socially acceptable. In a situation where both singledom and homosexual marriages are not possible, those belonging to the LGBTQ+ are forced into marriages. The partners are left to discover each other’s sexual orientation only after marriage.  The pretence and taking procreative heterosexuality as the normative process can prove detrimental to both partners. Large sections of society in Kashmir have already started negating the passage of legislation in Kashmir, fearing the spread of ‘immorality’. Belonging to a marginalised community in a politically conflicted region brings with it unique challenges. On the one hand there is a struggle for identity, and on the other hand, there is a struggle within the struggle. In this sub struggle for identity, the marginalised are always pushed to the periphery because their identity does not matter to the larger cause. Kashmir, which has been fighting for human rights for decades, has rarely seen the defence of rights of sexual minorities within the larger frame of human rights. Now, let’s assume for a moment that the legislation is passed in the J&K Assembly. Passage would mean right to life for Kashmir’s LGBTQ+. But the negative perception is so deep rooted, that the legislation will not change societal attitudes at once. The response that the leaders from Kashmir came up with to the legislation was opposition on grounds that it would promote ‘immorality’. Political pluralism in Kashmir should mean plurality of identities that it (ought to) allow individuals to assume. While the Valley fights for freedom of one form, declining freedom of another form to a minority is utterly against the principles of justice.  So when, through the deafening thumps of a  and  (musical instruments) one catches the sight of a transgender person performing with jubilation, one cannot help but be awed by their resilience.

Revati Laul,"There’s a word in Gujarati that one of Hardik Patel’s detractors used to describe his politics.  . The kind of politics where anything goes, where everything and its opposite is used at the same time as long as it serves a purpose. It’s like everything else in Gujarat – full of contradictions. Like the food truck in the park opposite Ahmedabad’s Karnavati Club run by a sardar who was raised in Gujarat. That offers the ‘Group Paratha’ - a new age masala mix of ingredients that seem to contradict each other but in Gujarat turn into a perfect marriage – onion,  ,   and cheese.  . Three years ago, when Hardik Patel kicked up a political storm demanding reservations in jobs and education for Patidars or the community of Patels, he did it in front of a poster of the tallest Patel leader - Sardar Patel. Now, he fasts in front of a   masala mix of leaders cutting across ideologies. The poster behind him has the entire pantheon from Gandhi and Patel to Bhagat Singh, Shivaji and Ambedkar. Even the nature of demands Hardik is making is full of contradictions. The Patels are the richest, most landed and powerful community in Gujarat. The previous chief minister and current deputy chief Minister are Patels. 44 of the 183 MLAs or a quarter of the elected representatives in the Assembly are Patels, even though they account for only an eighth or 12% of the population. So it would be nice, wouldn’t it, to lean on a quota? To use the muscle power the group has, by virtue of being loyal supporters of the BJP, to demand reservations or else threaten to withdraw support  . Now, there is a mountain of contradictions to feed off. To start with, Hardik’s detractors – people who have left his Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) or group of patidars agitating for a quota say, point at Hardik’s surroundings. He is fasting in a large farmhouse in an affluent part of Ahmedabad. He recently had his sister married with a big opulent splash. Where did this money come from, his critics ask; since Hardik isn’t earning anything and his father who is no longer working had a modest business making pumps for borewells. They also point to the opportunistic politics that shines through in the changed demands of the Patidars under Hardik. If they say their enemy number one is the ruling party, the BJP, then they have to draw on political support from the opposition. And there lies the rub. The Congress party’s main vote bank consists of people from the OBCs or Other Backward Classes quota. Supporting an agitation for quotas for another group takes away from the Congress vote base. Hardik’s supporters say it isn’t that simple. “90 percent of the Patidars (or Patels) are farmers,” says PAAS leader Geeta Patel Vastral. So it makes sense to add to the list of demands as the group grows. In the state elections that took place in 2017, PAAS did tacitly support the Congress, said another leader – Dinesh Bhambaniya. There is some give and take clearly as both PAAS and the Congress seem to be using Hardik’s fast and the surround sound to gauge who can get what from whom. So far, PAAS has muscles to flex. It made a considerable dent in the BJP’s vote base in the last three years, causing the biggest political earthquake in the state in two decades and the biggest headache for the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah combine. As far as Hardik’s farmhouse is concerned, Hardik’s spokesperson Manoj Panara says it’s rented for 11,000 rupees a month and that is paid by some of Hardik’s rich Patidar supporters. They also pitched in to the cost of their leader’s sister’s wedding. The real question behind Hardik’s test of political strength via his fast, now on day eleven, is how much this will alter the politics of Gujarat and the ego of its chief architects at the centre – Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah. The answer to that is as interesting and layered as the ‘Group Paratha’ with   and cheese. A good indicator was the state elections that took place in December 2017. The Patidars voted for the BJP in the city of Surat, which was ground zero for Hardik Patel’s agitations. But elsewhere in Gujarat, they swung the other way, particularly in rural areas in the north and centre – in districts like Mehsana and Rajkot. This forced BJP President Amit Shah to do some quick social re-engineering, once he figured that the party’s support base of Patidars were split and many were going against them. The BJP did door to door campaigns amongst the OBCs which formed bulk of the opposition Congress’ support base. The BJP made up its numbers of those lost to the Patidar agitation by weaning away OBCs from the Congress. It was a close call and the Congress won more seats than the BJP across rural Gujarat. The urban voters stuck to the BJP allowing it to win the overall numbers in the election. And now the general election of 2019 looms ahead. If Hardik Patel’s fast can make a further dent and pull away more voters from the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, he stands a good chance of being the main face of the opposition to the BJP when Gujarat votes again in 2022. It’s a long way away but the fast is the roadmap, the gauge, the   from which many new things will emerge. New appetites created. New   and cheese mixes in the pan.  .

Manoj Joshi,"It would be safe to say that Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s term has so far been inconsequential. It’s been a year since Prime Minister Modi appointed her to one of the top positions in the Union Cabinet. Considering her indifferent record as Commerce Minister, the appointment was a surprise. The Defence portfolio is, along with External Affairs, Home and Finance, the most important in the Union Cabinet. Not only does it confer a membership in the Cabinet Committee on Security, but it also comes with a membership in the Political Council of the National Nuclear Command Authority. It has been occupied by heavyweight political or senior party figures like Jagjivan Ram, Y B Chavan, Jaswant Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and A K Antony. Sitharaman doesn’t qualify in either of the categories, though it needs to be pointed out that most of Modi’s Council of Ministers do not fall in these two categories either. That is because, to be even mildly effective, the defence system needs reform and restructuring, a task that can only be done through the political leadership. Despite their size and lakhs of crores spent on them annually, the country’s armed forces are facing obsolescence, and do not have the ability to fight and win wars. That last phrase needs to be explained: no one doubts that the military will not hesitate to fight a war, but the issue is whether they can prevail. Bravery alone has never won wars. What is needed is a combination of organisation, equipment and higher defence management, and almost everyone agrees that in India’s case, we face obsolescence in   three areas. It is not as though no one knows what to do. Multiple expert committees have recommended a range of steps to reorganise the command system of the three services, as well as measures to restructure its organisation, and reform the defence R&D and production system. They have handed their recommendations to the Ministry of Defence which has promptly shelved them. First, it was led by the motor-mouth Manohar Parrikar, who was touted as the boy-wonder by virtue of his IIT background, but he proved to be a talker rather than a doer. Since not much was expected from Sitharaman, the disappointment has not been so marked. Little has been achieved by way of dealing with the task of modernising India’s force structure. Of course, not much can be achieved in a year. But we have not even made a start. She cannot, of course, be blamed for the government’s refusal to provide the armed forces with an adequate budget. Those decisions are taken above her pay grade. Nevertheless, for the record, the Services this year have been seriously shortchanged when it comes to modernisation. For example, they asked for Rs 172,203 crore for the capital outlay (to buy new equipment) in their budget, and all they got was Rs 93,982 crore. This was not even sufficient to meet the commitments of paying for the equipment already purchased and in the pipeline, worth Rs 110,043 crore. As a percentage of the GDP, the share of the defence budget is now 1.49 percent, the lowest in recent decades. That, after all, is her main job. Parrikar, using the time tested technique of politicians, simply created a committee headed by Lt Gen (retd) D B Shekatkar, and then shelved the report. Sitharaman didn’t get that chance. Instead, she herself has been bypassed by the government’s decision to create a new advisory committee for he, headed by the National Security Adviser. This Defence Planning Committee (DPC) has been asked to do everything the Minister should be doing. The only fiction is that the DPC will make “recommendations” to be processed by her. Presumably her job will be to obtain the approval for the said decisions from the Cabinet Committee on Security. It is not clear as to what she can do about it now. The DPC is headed by NSA Ajit Doval, who may formally be of a lower rank as compared to her, but he is much more powerful and experienced. And his DPC now has the mandate to “analyse and evaluate all relevant inputs relating to defence planning… national defence and security priorities, foreign policy imperatives, operational directives and associated requirements….” As party spokesperson, Sitharaman made her name as an articulate, dogged and hard working person. As Defence Minister, Sitharaman seems to be better known for the numerous photo-ops highlighting her role as India’s first female defence minister. From a lowly spokesperson of the party, she has come to occupy one of the highest positions in the government. That is certainly a great achievement for the women of the country, and for her personally. Sadly, however, she has done little with that office.

Ashutosh,"Rahul Gandhi compared the RSS to the ‘Muslim Brotherhood’ during a speech in Europe. It is quite possible that many people in India do not know much about the ‘Muslim Brotherhood’. So, a likely question is, what is the connection between RSS and the Brotherhood? And why did Rahul Gandhi take the risk of comparing the two? In today’s circumstances, should he have done that? Right now the communal atmosphere in the country is volatile. The business of spreading hate is doing very well. The Congress is faced with an opponent who is an expert at polarising every issue for a favourable political atmosphere. But according to me, the   that Rahul Gandhi picked to compare the Muslim Brotherhood to the RSS, was wrong. In their philosophy, ethics and behavior, the RSS and the Muslim Brotherhood are the same. RSS talks about the place of Hindus, while the Brotherhood talks about Muslims. The Brotherhood was founded in Egypt in 1928, while the RSS was founded three years prior, in 1925. While one wants to create a Hindu nation, the other hopes for an Islamic one. The Brotherhood also advocated religion-based politics. That its people have gotten caught up in the glamour of the West, and as a result moved away from Islamic tradition and culture. The intellectual class has been influenced by western education and has started thinking like them, imitating them, and accepting the path shown by them as the correct one while dismissing the Islamic ways. The Brotherhood stands as its resistance. Although it is not against modernity. It uses the latest technologies and equipment quite enthusiastically. The beginning of the twentieth century was a transitional time. On the one hand, the Western countries were trying to recover from the terror of World War I, and on the other hand, they were also under pressure to not let their imperialistic empires (spread across), the world weaken. Following the Russian Revolution, supporters of Marx and Lenin were growing around the world. Everywhere, people were looking for an alternative system against capitalism. Some cultures found hope in communism, others in their religion. If a part of Muslim society was attracted to the West, the other was moving closer to Islam. In the Arab area, Hasan al-Banna was looking for a future path in the light of Islam, while in South Asia, Abul A'la Maududi searched for ways to get rid of the British, through Islamic practices. The first attempt of both Abul A'la Maududi of Jamaat-e-Islami and Hassan al-Banna of the Brotherhood was to correctly diagnose the straying they were seeing in Muslim society, and to help it regain its former power, its lost personality, and not become the underling of another culture. Here, the Brotherhood and RSS are astonishingly similar. Hedgewar was irritated by the English-educated leaders of the Congress. He felt that while opposing the British, these leaders themselves became English, talking and thinking just like them. Thus, the RSS was formed to 'create a new India' by 'restoring the glorious history' of its traditions, and removing its vulnerabilities. The RSS then represented itself as a social institution. Emphasised 'character building'. While the Brotherhood was political in nature right from the beginning, it had no faith in Western-influenced institutions. It did not believe in democracy. It said that instead of 'people's will', 'Allah's will' should be paramount. It wanted to establish a Muslim nation based on Shariya. It is true that the RSS has never attempted a coup. It insists it has complete faith in democracy. They don’t question its basic principles, but they do not consider the present Indian Constitution to be in accordance with Indian tradition. They say it is a crass imitation of the West, so they advocate changes in it. Up till now they have been strengthening themselves via democracy. So far it hasn’t resorted to using violence to directly change the government, while the Brotherhood does believe in violence. In 1948, the Brotherhood attempted a coup. Their people were arrested. Egypt’s Prime Minister was assassinated by the Brotherhood. In return, al-Banna was also killed. They were banned. Abdel Nasser came to power, and when a fresh struggle started Nasser also banned the Brotherhood. After the 2011 Arab Spring the Brotherhood launched a political party, contested elections and their candidate Mohamed Morsi even became Prime Minister. But things didn’t work out. In just a year and a half, the army removed him from power and detained him, and today the Brotherhood has been declared a terrorist organisation. In this situation, the question that arises is whether Rahul Gandhi was highlighting the conceptual similarity between the RSS and the Brotherhood in his speech, or was the emphasis on other aspects? Rahul did not elaborate on that point. There is no doubt that in the hour of need, both organisations have scores of followers who were ready, and are still ready, to give their lives and kill others for the sake of ideologies. The only difference is that Egypt never had democracy. Abdel Nasser was a big leader, but he was still a dictator. After him came Anwar Sadat. He was assassinated. Hosni Mubarak was removed by a mass movement. After the 2011 revolution, it was hoped that democracy would be established; in reality, it didn’t happen. Whereas in India the Constitution came into effect. Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress held elections and did not let the democracy turn into a dictatorship. In the last 71 years, democracy has come to occupy great social and political importance for this country, and no leader or party or organization can rule the country or win its heart by defying it. Therefore, despite the Sangh's anger towards the Constitution, it did not have the courage to go against it, and it did not use violence the way the Brotherhood did. The hate being spewed all over social media is also a form of violence. In the last four and a half years, hatred has been established in people's homes, hearts and minds. The scope for dialogue in a democracy has been reduced. Having different opinions has started to become a crime, and treason. If this is what Rahul Gandhi was indicating, he was right. But there is also the question of politics and strategy here. Hindu-Muslim issues are a favourite for RSS and Hindutva forces. They want this issue to be discussed night and day. This helps in creating a special type of polarisation in the country. Today, circumstances are such that the people sitting in power do not want debates on everyday issues, people talking about  , or the lack of employment becoming an issue among the masses. So that the new generation does not believe that they are not getting jobs because of the government's failures. If they only stay ‘Hindu-Muslim’, it will make things easier for the  Rahul Gandhi’s comparison is great fodder for intellectual debate, but it is not good politics. When the country is in ‘wartime’, the adornments of peace do not sit very well. This comparison is a peacetime jewel. In a war zone, only the cannons, pistols and swords do well.

On Saturday, the petrol price in the national capital breached the Rs 80/litre mark. In Mumbai too, the petrol price rose by 12 paise to reach Rs 87.89 per litre on Sunday, while the diesel price was at Rs 77.09 per litre. The surge in fuel prices is largely attributed to the rise in crude oil prices and high excise duty in the country.

Sanjay Pugalia,"Mohd Ibrahim & Vishal Kumar  Hera Khan Rupee is constantly depreciating and now stands at 72 against the US dollar. Some experts believe that the rupee can fall further and stand at 73-74 against the US dollar. A 12 percent fall in just 8 months is unprecedented. Out of all emerging markets, the rupee’s fall has been the steepest. While exports are not picking up, imports have risen. Hence the disturbance in the balance of payments, resulting in losses, is breaking all records. Rise in crude oil prices is resulting in a surge in petrol and diesel prices. The weak rupee increases import bill. The bond market yield is rising about 8% and indicating how evryone is worried about the state of the economy now. One may say that global factors are responsible for the depreciation of the rupee – the US-China trade war and the sliding currencies of other emerging markets, so one must not blame the Indian govt for the weakening rupee. Because globally, the situation is adverse. Our economy is still growing at 8.2%. But this is partly true. The other fact is that when the time is not right, how can you shoot on your own foot. This announcement has left everyone in the markets worried. Anyway, there is a net FII outflow this year which means there is a lesser investment and more outflow in the market. The NRI whose patriotism was celebrated for the last five years is now a suspect. Just like an Urban Naxal, he is now an NRI Naxal. An honest NRI and a dishonest NRI are being treated as two peas in a pod. Why can't we distinguish between thieves and honest businessmen despite the strict KYC (know your customer) rules? Why do we need new rules then? Because it is easier to shout slogans but tough to work with existing set of rules. Our regulators and officers are not being able to tell the difference between 'fund ownership', 'fund beneficiary' 'fund manager' and 'fund controller.' According to SEBI, there is an unnecessary panic in the market. But foreign investors aren't convinced with this argument and are exploring other investment destinations. India needs investment in dollars now. A weak rupee will not boost exports because we are not competitive enough and there is an issue with our quality too. Expensive Crude oil will increase import bills which will, in turn, lead to inflation. RBI will not come to the rescue of the falling rupee. And in fact, it should not. There is a probability that RBI will not intervene unless the rupee falls to 74-75 a dollar. RBI might increase interest rates if inflation continues to rise. The govt charges more excise on petrol products. Citizens have been appealing for a reduction in prices. People are just speculating whether the government will think twice before reducing excise duty, especially before the state elections. Which means that the capital which the private sector needs for growth, will be more expensive. As the country stands at the crossroads of elections, the rate of recovery of immovable debt is sluggish. Investors will wait for a clear picture before investing big amounts.

For the next 3 days, they fed the kids and pregnant women water from the small tank, while others relied on the rainwater. They made stew out of leftover vegetables and used the broken furniture as firewood. Finally, help reached. Today, most relief camps in Chengannur in Kerala have been closed and people have begun rebuilding their homes. But for people like these 71, there is not much of home left. The small town of Chengannur in Alappuzha was at the brink of losing most of its inhabitants to the floods. Thanks to one person, Chengannur gained overnight popularity with help coming in from all over the world. MLA Saji Cherian broke down on a night news show and begged for helicopters to be brought in immediately, else, he said, at least 50,000 will be washed away. Within hours, 7 helicopters rushed in, Navy and NDRF came in with their boats, and rescue began. The MLA smiles with gratitude saying they have now lost count of the number of trucks and cars that have came in from all over India to help rebuild Chengannur. When I visited a camp in Chengannur, I found all the residents thanking one police man who was cleaning up as he spoke. Turns out he was one of the persons who rescued 71 people from the rooftop. Well, Sunderlal was a superhero in many other stories as well. In the corner of the room sat Sarojini in a daze. She was with her husband, stuck in their house the day the floods struck. They tried standing on furniture for a while and then began using tables and chairs to guard themselves from doors breaking open. Soon, the two drifted apart to different rooms. When the rescue team arrived, they broke down the roof and found Sarojini holding on to the bars of a window with water up till her nose. Her husband was on the brink of death. The death toll could’ve been way higher if not for the synchronised work by all departments of the administration – MLA, Collector, police, Panchayat – since the first day. I spent hours chasing the MLA from one venue to another because he was always on the go, visiting relief camps, giving people assurance of help and attending meetings. Cheriyan has been conducting meetings every day with top officials, panchayat representatives and those in charge of various relief camps. Every representative needs to submit a perfect tally of the number of people rescued, provided relief to and those who will need comprehensive help as they have nothing left. The people of Chengannur cannot stop gushing about the stellar work done by students of Chengannur College of Engineering. A group of 40 students were stuck in the college campus and when the floods became worse, they moved to a higher floor in the building. Now that they were safe, they didn’t want to rest. A few hours of brain-storming, scribbles on a notepad and frantic typing on the laptop later, they set up the first camp of Chengannur. A few courageous and brilliant swimmers among the students braved the waters and began rescuing hundreds everyday. The people who were rescued stayed in the classrooms and benevolent donors kept flooding the campus with truckloads of food, clothes, bedsheets and mats. The students then created a software and maintained a database of everyone in Chengannur, their current status and which relief centre they were housed in. This was a huge relief for so many outside Chengannur who couldn’t reach their near and dear ones. Today, almost all relief camps have been shut and people have returned to their houses but for some, there isn’t a building in the address they once lived in. But the fighting spirit is commendable. Now, the sun is out and the water has receded. The wounds have healed but the scars remain. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Zoheb Hossain,"It is well established that judges speak only through their judgments. I read a piece on Friday which criticised our Supreme Court for being verbose unlike their UK counterpart. I disagree, since every single word in the judgment titled   is relevant and warranted. It is important to appreciate that justices of the Supreme Court, while writing judgments and especially those declaring penal provisions of longstanding statutes as unconstitutional, are speaking truth to power – more so when the Union of India chooses to be ambivalent about its stand in court. The Chief Justice of India and the other judges speaking for the Constitution Bench have re-emphasised the role of the Supreme Court as a counter-majoritarian institution while declaring Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code as unconstitutional –to the extent that it applied to consensual same sex relations. Throughout his commentary he emphasises upon the difference between constitutional morality and social morality – and that the rights of individuals cannot be subverted by the latter – so long as there is rule of law in India. While emphasising on notions of inclusiveness, dignity and non-discrimination as bulwarks of the Indian Constitution, CJI Dipak Misra holds that “social morality has to succumb to the concept of constitutional morality”. CJI Misra imposes – even upon a popular government – a duty to protect constitutional values which may not be acceptable to the majority. The astute observation that “any attempt to push and shove a homogeneous, uniform, consistent and a standardised philosophy throughout the society would violate the principle of constitutional morality” is timeless. His observations are being made with a clear eye to the future, where he also speaks of the notions of “transformative constitutionalism” and refers to the Constitution as “... almost revolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval, hierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy.” Likewise, Justice Chandrachud in his concurring opinion has observed that our Constitution does not demand conformity nor does it contemplate the mainstreaming of culture. For instance, criminalising an individual’s eating habits may not pass the constitutional muster after this judgment. Likewise, arrest of political activists holding contrarian views may equally fall foul of the provisions of the Constitution. Justice Nariman also calls out the   approach in constitutional matters as unsustainable. He observes that “the fact that only a minuscule fraction of the country’s population constitutes lesbians and gays or transgenders, and that in the last 150 years less than 200 persons have been prosecuted for committing the offence under Section 377, is neither here nor there. When it is found that privacy interests come in and the State has no compelling reason to continue an existing law which penalises same-sex couples who cause no harm to others... it is clear that Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 have all been transgressed...” Justice Nariman is conscious not only of the vertical application of laws by the State upon the LGBTQ+ community but also the horizontal relations between individuals. Therefore, his declaration “that such groups are entitled to the protection of equal laws, and are entitled to be treated in society as human beings without any stigma being attached to any of them” – is a direction not just to the State, but to the people at large to treat vulnerable groups with dignity and without any stigma. The evolution of the Supreme Court is also evident in its clear rejection of the populist view taken by the same Court in   some years back. The error committed in the earlier judgment has been called out, wherein the Court had then held that Section 377 IPC does not criminalise a particular people or identity or orientation and only identifies certain acts which, when committed, would constitute an offence. The conceptual leap taken by the Supreme Court from   to   is that Section 377 does not simply criminalise “conduct” – rather it criminalises identities of entire groups of people. The court has made a huge transformative leap itself, not just jurisprudentially but psychologically – moving away from the popular view – in acknowledging that homosexuality is not just located in the genitals, but is also a matter of the mind and heart. That human beings are psycho-sexual beings and therefore, unlike  , where the Court viewed non-peno-vaginal sexual intercourse as an offensive   alone irrespective of who commits it, today the Supreme Court has correctly identified the problem in terms of the effect of the provision on fundamental rights of sexual minorities, and formulated the issue as a   – which is a matter of dignity, equality, privacy and autonomy. It is not just that the Court disagreed with its view in  . Similarly, In his chapter, titled “  Justice Chandrachud very perceptively breaks the false dichotomy between conduct and identity and notes thus: “While facially Section 377 only criminalizes certain “acts”, and not relationships, it alters the prism through which a member of the LGBTQ is viewed. Conduct and identity are conflated. The impact of criminalising non-conforming sexual relations is that individuals who fall outside the spectrum of heteronormative sexual identity are perceived as criminals.” Justice Chandrachud, consistent with his view in  of the nature of the right to privacy, not being limited to a spatial right, but a right based on the autonomy and dignity of an individual, has clearly held that the right to sexual privacy, founded on the right to autonomy of a free individual, must break free of the majoritarian heteromornative sexual identity. He observes that “privacy creates “tiers of ‘reputable’ and ‘disreputable’ sex”, only granting protection to acts behind closed doors. Thus, it is imperative that the protection granted for consensual acts in private must also be available in situations where sexual minorities are vulnerable in public spaces on account of their sexuality and appearance. The Court has sent a loud and clear message that same sex relations are not meant for the closet, irrespective of what large sections of people might believe, and that people who indulge in same-sex relations are equal citizens who cannot be relegated to behind closed doors. Justice Indu Malhotra has also unequivocally underpinned the counter-majoritarian role of the Court by holding that a subjective notion of public or societal morality which discriminates against LGBT persons, and subjects them to criminal sanction runs counter to the concept of Constitutional morality, and cannot form the basis of a legitimate State interest. Accordingly, Justice R F Nariman has gone a step further and cast an obligation on the Union of India to ensure the elimination of stigma associated with homosexuality by giving wide publicity to this judgment and also to give periodic sensitisation to police officials and other officers of the Union of India and States towards the issues discussed in the judgment. It is equally the duty of the entire citizenry to discuss various aspects of the judgment and take the message of the Court forward because this is only the first step in rooting out deep-seated prejudice of hundreds of years held by a vast majority of the population even today.

He was speaking at the launch of a book penned by Congress leader Kapil Sibal – “Shades of Truth - A Derailed Journey” – which highlights the failures of the Modi government. Slamming the government over job creation, Singh said that people are still waiting for the promised 2 crore jobs. “Programs like Make in India and Standup India are yet to make a meaningful impact on industrial production growth. Small and marginal enterprises are yet to derive significant benefit from the ease of doing business schemes,” said Singh. “Demonetisation and hasty implementation of GST have badly hurt these enterprises,” he added. “The Modi government has undermined the values that any democratic party, democratic polity should fiercely protect,” he said.

Eshwar Gole,"Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Friday, 7 September, launched his new book, “Shades of Truth – A Journey Derailed”, that aims to highlight the failures of the Narendra Modi government. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Vice-President Hamid Ansari were present at the book launch, held at Teen Murti Bhawan in Delhi. The other guests of honour included P Chidambaram, Sitaram Yechury, Chandan Mitra and Sharad Yadav. In conversation with NDTV’s Sreenivasan Jain, Sibal along with other leaders spoke on a range of issues including cow vigilantism, Congress’alleged “soft Hindutva” pitch and Rahul Gandhi’s as a probable Prime Minister. Predicting the results of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Sharad Yadav said this government (NDA) will not come to power. Sitaram Yechury said a coalition of all secular and progressive forces uniting on the basis of the constitutional order will strengthen the country and ensure that this government doesn’t come back to power. Sibal said if the Opposition is able to replicate what it did in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, there is no chance the BJP will win. Slamming the rising cases of cow vigilantism in the country, Sibal said that the poor and the farmers are scared even to trade old cattle anymore. “There is nothing wrong with protecting the cow. What’s wrong is that you kill people to protect the cow. That’s the issue in this country. People can’t trade, people can’t sell (cows). When cows get old, people sell them to get money and buy a cow that gives milk. That’s the politics that is prevelant in the country,” he said. When asked about the impeachment of Chief Justice of India, Sibal said that Congress supported it to send a message acoess against wrongdoings in the juidiciary. “All we wanted that if there were allegations of that serious nature, all we wanted was an inquiry,” he added. Chidambaram said that the party, however, was divided over the matter. “There were two views within the party. The other view was that it’s not likely to pass even the first hurdle. I subscribed to the view that it will be a futile exercise because it won’t even pass the first exercise. As I predicted, the effort failed in the first hurdle,” said Chidambaram. While discussing the issue of a Prime Ministerial candidate to match the calibre of PM Modi in 2019, Sibal said that the Opposition will cross the bridge when it comes to it. When asked about his views Rahul Gandhi’s potential to be the PM, Sibal said that politics is not about one man. “We have seen a great leader as the Prime minister of the country but where has he taken this country, that’s the question we must ask. Politics is not about one man. Politics is about collectivity, politics is about ideology, politics is about conviction and passion. He (Gandhi) is the president of the party. Wherever he goes, people throng,” he said. “What happened in 2004? Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a tall leader was on one side and no none was named on the other side. What happened?” he added. As Sibal was answering his final question, former J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah asked the panel that if the coalition comes to power, will they be forgivers or will they use all the instruments of the state to punish? Sibal responded in the negative, saying that they are fighting the government’s method right now, and they’ll keep fighting it in the future as well. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz,"On 31 August when the new Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik presided over the first meeting of the State Administrative Council (SAC), his first decision was to hold the over-due elections for the Panchayati Raj institutions as well as the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The highest decision-making body, comprising Governor Malik and his three advisors —K Vijay Kumar, Khursheed Ahmad Ganai and Bharat Bhushan Vyas —had consensus over conducting elections for 78 ULBs in four phases from 1 October to 5 October. Unlike the Panchayat elections, the ULB polls in J&K are supposed to be held on party basis. The SAC decided to conduct panchayat elections for electing 35,096   and 4,490   by way of universal franchise on non-party basis in 8 phases, from 8 November to 4 December, 2018. While the Governor’s administration was strategising initiatives to neutralise unprecedented guerrilla threats to contestants and electors, coupled with a call of boycott from the separatists’ Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL), National Conference (NC) patriarch, former Chief Minister and the highest profile mainstream politician, Dr Farooq Abdullah, announced at an impromptu news conference on 4 September that his party would not participate in the forthcoming elections. The law that guarantees a special status for Jammu and Kashmir and restriction of the fundamental right of immovable property, government employment, scholarship and vote in all elections, excluding the Parliamentary elections, to only the State’s Permanent Residents, has been challenged in the Supreme Court of India through a number of petitions. Competing with almost all the parties from Mehbooba Mufti’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the separatist Hurriyat Conference, Farooq has perceived intriguing diversion in the arguments offered by the Government of India’s attorneys, in defence of 35-A. The NC leadership has pointed out that the Advocate on Record on behalf of the Governor’s regime, has sought deferment of the hearing simply for the fact that the State was heading for Panchayati Raj and ULB elections. “The (NC’s) core group felt that this decision was taken in a hurried manner without taking into consideration the prevailing situation   by the powers that be, by unnecessarily fiddling with Art. 35-A. The core group unanimously decided that the J&K National Conference will not participate in these elections unless and until Government of India and the State government clears its position in this regard and take effective steps for the protection of Art 35-A in and outside the Courts,” the NC’s statement read out by Farooq elaborated. Even in those elections that led to the stitching of a coalition between PDP and BJP, NC’s vote was equivalent to that of the PDP, though it won only 15 seats as compared to PDP’s 28 and BJP’s 25 in the House of 87. It wrested back the all-important Central Kashmir Lok Sabha seat in the by-elections of April 2017, marred by violence and low voter turnout. It has a wide cadre base in all the three regions of the state. Even in the last fortnight’s Hill Council elections in Kargil, Ladakh, NC emerged as the single largest party. NC’s boycott to Panchayat and ULB elections is also significant in the sense that it has done so only once—in the Lok Sabha elections of 1996. It indicates how big a blow its boycott would be to the turnout and credibility of the impending democratic exercise. In a political scenario when even the BJP and its ally, Peoples Conference, which has two seats in current Assembly, have chosen to be mute spectators to the mainstream political vacuum and the proportionately swelling influence of separatists and militants, nobody is expected to identify with the Centre. Even the President of J&K Pradesh Congress Committee, Ghulam Ahmad Mir, has been stating repeatedly that the PDP-BJP had left Kashmir in a quagmire and both, contestants as well as the voters, were feeling completely insecure. “The central government’s plea in the Supreme Court to link the decision on 35-A with the   and urban bodies elections, was a disastrous idea, which has further alienated the people and complicated the situation on ground,” PDP’s President and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti tweeted within hours of the NC’s boycott decision on Wednesday. The organisation’s Chairman Shafiq Mir told   that the Panchayat and ULB elections were restricted to ensuring peoples’ participation at the grass-roots level. “It’s completely preposterous to attack party politics to such elections even as the ULB polls would be contested on party symbols,” he asserted. Shafiq Mir dismissed Farooq’s announcement as “drama”. “We are all unmistakeably for the protection of 35-A. Let it be clear that 35-A is a law. Laws are made by Assembly and Parliament, not by Panchayats or municipal bodies. If Farooq Abdullah is serious and sincere to that political cause, why doesn’t he resign from his seat in Lok Sabha? Why don’t his MLAs and MLCs resign in protest in the State legislature? Why are they holding hostage the  elections?” Shafiq Mir argued. When the ULB and   elections were held after a long pause of over 30 years respectively in 2005 and 2011, the situation in Kashmir was in a sharp contrast to the rage and turbulence witnessed after April 2015. Notwithstanding the separatists’ boycott calls and threats from different militant groups, both the elections had witnessed huge enthusiasm and a high voter turnout. Fear of the gun existed to an extent, and threats from militants were not unreal. NC’s elected councillor and would-be Mayor in Srinagar Municipal Corporation, Maqbool Khaksaar, was shot dead between his residence and mosque at Ikhrajpora Rajbagh in a few days after results of the 20 January, 2005, ULB polling were declared. One of their female candidates enjoyed substantial support from the Muslim electorate. She was among several candidates of the minority community who were returned in Pulwama, Uri, Kunzar Tangmarg and other places. Against all odds, the first post-1990 panchayat elections in 2011 broke all past records of enthusiasm and voter turnout, beating even the peaceful Jammu province. Hundred per cent turnout was recorded at several stations in 17 phases of polling in the Valley from 13 April to 27 June. Now, one of the most turbulent districts in so-called ‘liberated’ South Kashmir, Kulgam, recorded a meteoric turnout of 81 percent. Budgam recorded 77 percent. Baramulla (87 percent), Kupwara (85 percent) and Ganderbal (85 percent) went ever higher. Both in the 2008 and 2010 clashes, scores of demonstrators were killed and maimed in unceasing clashes with police and security forces. Yet the historic elections marginalised both the separatists as well as the militants. A trail of militant strikes failed to dampen the spirits, even as Afzal Guru’s execution, killing of six civilians in a clash by BSF in Gool area of Ramban and unprecedented communal clashes in Kishtwar threw serious challenges in Omar Abdullah’s rule in 2013. Scores of over 33,000 elected   and   resigned out of fear. Yet many of them like Zoona of Sopore stood their ground. She lost an eye in a militant attack. Official statistics put it at 12 but Shafiq Mir insists that 16 panches and sarpanches were shot dead by militants from 2011 to 2017. In spite of holding the best ever panchayat elections in 2011 and handling the situation impressively from 2011 to the end of his government in 2014, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah demonstrated little interest to conduct the ULB elections. Even as the four seats, reserved for panchayat representatives, were filled up by election after decades in the Legislative Council, two seats reserved for ULB representatives remained continuously vacant. “It’s a totally different situation now. Militants have repeatedly threatened to blind anybody participating in these elections with sulphuric acid. They are attacking security forces and police and eliminating their targets at will. None of the MLAs, MLCs or ex-Ministers dares to stay at home or visit constituency. They wouldn’t get candidates, let alone voters,” said a senior leader of the Congress party on condition of anonymity. He asserted that politics had failed completely as all the mainstream politicians were in competitive secessionism, and not one of them had contested the separatists politically. “Government says it would deploy thousands of police and paramilitary personnel for conducting the   and municipal elections. Will that bring the voters out? Who will protect them after participating in these elections?” asked the senior politician. After the 14th Finance Commission Award linked allocation of grants to elected  institutions and ULBs, former Governor NN Vohra made sustained efforts to conduct the elections. He looked seriously concerned over the prospect of J&K losing the award allocation of Rs 5,480 crore in absence of elected panchayat and municipal bodies. He got the relevant laws and rules amended for conducting both the elections. When Mehbooba Mufti took over as Chief Minister in April 2016, her first priority was to get elected as MLA from Anantnag. In low turnout but violence-free polling, she was returned in June. In days of her election, iconic militant commander Burhan Wani was killed along with two of his associates in an encounter in Kokernag on 8 July. It triggered massive demonstrations and lent a fresh lease of life to insurgency which continues to be unceasing. For the first time in over a decade, the number of listed militants has crossed 325. Even Mehbooba from December 2017 to her exit in June 2018 announced several times to conduct the panchayat and ULB elections but every time she failed. With people attacking security forces during encounters with militants, joining slain militants’ funeral processions in large numbers and the militants returning for gun salutes to their colleagues across South Kashmir and some other areas, there are few takers to the Government’s resolve to hold the panchayat and ULB elections in Kashmir. The demonstrations provoked by BJP’s support to petitions against Article 35-A have united the Kashmiris from mainstream to separatist activists after a long time.

Seventy years later the present Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik has adorned an 'expensive ornament', the Legislative Council or the Vidhan Parishad, while the state is facing a heavy loan burden of around Rs 92,000 crore. The Odisha Assembly passed the resolution by 104 votes to set up the Legislative Council on 6 September 2018. The proposed legislative council will have 49 members. According Article 171(1) of the Constitution, the legislative council of a state cannot have more than one third members of the total strength of the Legislative Assembly. Odisha has total 147 members in the Legislative Assembly. All the members of the Council will get salary, allowances and benefits like that of the MLAs. The Odisha government will have to bear an extra burden of Rs 35 crore per annum towards the salary and allowances of the members of the Legislative Council. The cost towards infrastructure, staff, accommodation, security and secretarial expenses to run the Legislative Council have not been estimated yet. The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Council will enjoy the status and benefits of a Cabinet minister. The detailed expenditure towards this is yet to be worked out. The annual administrative expenditure for Odisha Assembly is around 45 crore rupees. Similarly, to run a 49-member Upper House the state government will have to cough up several more crores every year. In a cash-strapped state like Odisha, when the debt burden of the state has gone up to Rs 92,000 crore, the push for setting up a Legislative Council shows a short-sighted political move of an astute chief minister like Naveen Patnaik. It doesn’t seem like the 2019 elections will be a smooth sail for the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) though Patnaik still holds sway in Odisha politics even after 18 years of uninterrupted rule. Anti-incumbency, factionalism and the spate of corruption allegations against many leaders of the party could pose a serious challenge for Patnaik’s leadership in 2019. The BJD needs to redefine its strategy for the 2019 elections. The clean image of Patnaik may not earn political dividends to the party in the upcoming elections. In the present Assembly there are around 50 members from the ruling party who are serving their second or third terms. There are many BJD leaders who have brought ill repute to the party because of their links with various scams especially the multi-thousand crore chit fund scam. In such a situation many sitting MLAs may not get tickets for the 2019 elections. Few members of Parliament may also lose their candidature because of lacklustre performance. In an election year, Patnaik can’t afford to disappoint many party leaders. The Legislative Council could be a good avenue to rehabilitate the disgruntled leaders who may not get chance to contest the upcoming election. With 118 MLAs and a dominating position among the local bodies across the state the BJD could send 35-40 members to the Legislative Council. This will also give a chance to the ruling party to bring in many new young leaders into the electoral fray without disappointing the veterans. Though, according to Patnaik, establishment of the Legislative Council will help in ‘wider consultation’ to maintain the ‘growth momentum’ of the state, it’s a long road ahead before the Upper House becomes a reality in Odisha. The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Odisha have been opposing the move of the Naveen Patnaik government to establish a Legislative Council. But the recent new-found bonhomie between the BJP at the Centre and the BJD has left the state leaders of the BJP in a dilemma. As the Odisha Assembly has passed the resolution to set up the Legislative Council, now the resolution has to be sent to the Centre. According to Article 169 of the Constitution the resolution needs to be passed in the both Houses of the Parliament. The BJD has extended its support to the BJP on many important occasions like demonetisation, presidential elections, election of the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha to name a few. The BJD also came to the aid of the ruling BJP by staging a walk-out during the recent debate on the no-confidence motion against the Modi government in the Lok Sabha. As the resolution to establish Odisha Legislative Council needs to be passed in both the Houses of the Parliament, will the Centre now oblige the BJD? The bills to set up Legislative Councils in Assam and Rajasthan, now both ruled by the BJP, are pending for the Parliament’s nod since 2013. In such a case, preference to the Odisha Legislative Council Bill could be a tight rope walk for the BJP. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Former President Barack Obama said Friday, 7 September, President Donald Trump, is ""the symptom, not the cause"" of division and polarization in the US. Trump, the former president said, is ""just capitalising on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years."" His comments came during a speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he accepted an ethics in government award. The remarks served as Obama's first steps into the political fray ahead of the fall campaign. While he has endorsed candidates and appeared at fundraising events, he has spent much of his post-presidency on the political sidelines. In unusually direct terms, he made clear his concerns about politics in the Trump era and implored voters — especially young people — to show up at the polls in the November midterm elections. The speech was a preview of the argument that Obama is likely to make throughout the fall. On Saturday, the former president will stump for House Democratic candidates from California at an event in Orange County, a conservative-leaning part of California where Republicans are at risk of losing several congressional seats. Next week, Obama plans to campaign in Ohio for Richard Cordray, the Democratic nominee for governor, and Ohio Democrats. Obama's campaign activity will continue through October and will include fundraising appearances, according to an Obama adviser. The adviser was not authorized to discuss Obama's thinking publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. While the former president will be visible throughout the general election, the adviser said that Obama will not be a daily presence on the campaign trail. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

David Bauder,"The coup of publishing a column by an anonymous Trump administration official bashing the boss could backfire on The New York Times if the author is unmasked and turns out to be a little-known person, or if the newspaper's own reporters solve the puzzle. Within hours of the essay appearing on the paper's website, the mystery of the writer's identity began to rival the Watergate-era hunt for ""Deep Throat"" in Washington, and a parade of Trump team members issued statements Thursday saying, in effect, ""it's not me."" The Times' only clue was calling the author a ""senior administration official."" James Dao, the newspaper's op-ed editor, said in the Times' daily podcast that while an intermediary brought him together with the author, he conducted a background check and spoke to the person to the point that he was ""totally confident"" on the identity. It's a term used loosely around the White House. Press offices often release statements or offer background briefings and ask that the information be attributed to a senior administration official. The Partnership for Public Services tracks approximately 700 senior positions in government, ones that require Senate confirmation. Paul Light, a New York University professor and expert on the federal bureaucracy, said about 50 people could have legitimately written the column — probably someone in a political position appointed by President Donald Trump. Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, meanwhile, puts the number of true senior administration officials at around 100, defining them as high up in the government and having regular interaction with the White House or the president himself. Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign tweeted that, based on her experience with the Times and sourcing, ""this person could easily be someone most of us have never heard of and more junior than you'd expect."" That would be a problem for NYT, partly through no fault of its own, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The column attracted so much attention — as much for its existence as for what it actually said — that it raised the expectation that the author is someone powerful, she said. If the person is not among the 20 top people in the administration, ""the Times just gets creamed,"" said Tom Bettag, a veteran news producer and now a University of Maryland journalism instructor. It would look like the Times was trying to stir the pot if it were not a high-level person, said Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ‘Meet the Press’. Ruth Marcus, deputy editorial page editor of The Washington Post, told Todd on MSNBC that if the author had come to the Post it would provoke a serious discussion, because the newspaper has not in the past run anonymous op-ed columns. She said no one approached the Post to hawk the column. ""When you give someone anonymity on this, you are putting your credibility on the line,"" Marcus said. News organizations have different standards for using information from unnamed sources. Frequently, they try to give some indication of why the person would be in a position to know something — the senior administration official, for example — and why anonymity was granted. In this case, the newspaper considered that the person's job would clearly be at risk and that the person could even be physically threatened, Dao said. He did not see much difference in the use of anonymity in news and opinion pages. In an interview on Thursday with Fox News, Trump said, ""What they've done is virtually, you know, it's treason, you could call it a lot of things."" Dao said, ""There's nothing in the piece that strikes me as being relevant to, or undermining, the national security."" The newspaper maintains a strict policy of separation between its news and opinion side, and the decision to publish the column without identifying the author was made by Dao and his boss, editorial page editor James Bennet, in consultation with publisher AG Sulzberger. The paper's executive editor Dean Baquet, is responsible for the news side and was not part of the decision. Few people at the paper know the writer's identity, Dao said, and he could not see any circumstances under which it would be divulged. The Times' own news story about the column said the author's identity is ""known to the Times' editorial page department but not to the reporters who cover the White House."" Trump, in a tweet Thursday evening, posed the question: ""Are the investigative 'journalists' of the New York Times going to investigate themselves - who is the anonymous letter writer?"" Indeed, like hundreds of other reporters in Washington, the Times' news staff is trying to find out the writer's name. If the Times learns the identity, it could raise serious questions about the newspaper's ability to protect a confidential source among people who don't know — or don't believe — that one part of the newspaper will keep important information away from another. ""You could write a novel about this,"" said Jamieson, author of the upcoming ‘Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.’ ''If they engage in successful journalism, at some level they discredit themselves.""

The film was to be screened at the institute on Thursday. However, director Harishankar Nachimuthu, who made the film as a student project, has come forth to say that the real reason behind the cancellation was due to pressure from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right wing students’ group. Here is 30 year-old Naichmuthu’s personal statement, shared on Facebook.  is based on the life of Rupali Jadhav, a Dalit woman who is a member of the Kabir Kala Manch. KKM was involved in organizing the Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada on December 31, 2017 after which violence broke out in Bhima Koregaon. Members of the Manch have faced arrests on chargesof conspiring  with Maoists. FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola responded to Naichmuthu’s statement, saying “The allegation that FTII cancelled the screening under pressure from a particular organisation is so preposterous and baseless that replying to it would lend dignity to it.” Later, in his own statement, Kainthola wrote, “H Nachimuthu did not give any prior requisition to book the Main Theatre for the screening of his documentary. Moreover the first screening of a student’s new documentary is normally only for internal viewing. Documentaries are generally screened for internal assessment only and are not scheduled for screening for general public unless otherwise decided. Public screenings of student projects are not allowed without permission, since various pre-requisites like CBFC certificate, logistics, availability of infrastructure etc. have to be met before outside public is invited for screenings.” The FTII Students Association has also issued a statement, siding with Naichmuthu and saying “We question the concerned if an art school can function independently when such organisations can dictate the content of our films being made inside the campus.” In August 2013, members of the ABVP had raised objection to a screening of Anand Patwardhan’s documentary   and a performance by KKM at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI), attacking five students of the FTII in the process.

Manasa Rao Megha Kaveri,"Over a year after the first raids were conducted in the multi-crore Gutkha scam that rocked Tamil Nadu, former Chennai Police Commissioner and an accused in the probe, S George has confirmed that there was, in fact, a scam among the ranks of the Tamil Nadu police department in connection with the unchecked sale of gutkha. However, proclaiming himself as innocent, George went on to blame many other officers – seniors and subordinates – including sitting DGP TK Rajendran. In an unprecedented press conference at his residence, the visibly exasperated former city top cop said that the scam erupted in June 2017 to scuttle the chances of him and TK Rajendran who were in the running to be the state’s next Director General of Police. In July 2016, raids were conducted at the godown, offices and residences of a pan masala and gutka manufacturer in Tamil Nadu, who was facing charges of evading tax to the tune of Rs 250 crore. Seized during the raid was a diary containing names of those who were believed to have been paid off by the gutkha manufacturers– including the Tamil Nadu Health Minister S Vijayabaskar, current Director General of Police TK Rajendran and other top police officials. George too has been named in a petition moved by DMK MLA J Anbazhagan, seeking a CBI probe into the scam. Citing this, George denied that he had been the Commissioner of Police at the time the payments had allegedly been made. According to the petition, the payouts were done in three instalments between April and June 2016 while S George was the Chennai Police Commissioner between 2012 and 2014 and from March to July 2017. In an attempt to exonerate himself, George further said that following the death of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2016, he wrote to the government in an attempt to quell rumours on social media. Stating that such a massive illegal activity could not have taken place with the ‘blessing of the Commissioner’ alone, he implicated current Villupuram SP Jayakumar and other officers. “I want to ask a fundamental question. There are 300 police stations in Chennai city. Is it possible or probable that such a massive illegal activity can go only with the blessing of the Commissioner?” he asked. When a reporter pointed out that one of the ledgers claimed that Rs 15 lakh had been paid to George during Christmas in 2015, an angry George shot back, asking the reporter to disclose his faith. “Why should an ex CoP be paid? When you are no longer to be paid. I'm a Christian. So if you say Christmas, it becomes credible. I'm a Christian. I'm an ex CoP. Somebody is misusing my name,” he asked. He claimed that he came to know of the allegations after he took over and hence wrote a letter to the Government of Tamil Nadu to inquire into the matter. He also stated that before he wrote the letter, he conducted preliminary inquiries with the then Deputy Commissioner (Intelligence) Vimala who had assumed charge in December 2015. He said that Vimala told him about her visit to a paan masala godown in Red Hills after CB-CID had seized goods from there along with Jayakumar, who was the Deputy Commissioner (CCB) then and that she did not find any tobacco products there. He said that she also informed him of visits made by officers from the Food Safety Department and other higher officials. Further stating that even officers at the inspector level knew of the scam, George placed the blame squarely on Jayakumar (currently the and said that he had asked other police officers to leave the gutkha case and instead focus on red sandalwood. Emphasising that higher officials ignored Vimala’s report which also named a list of officers, George blamed DC Jayakumar for not having reported about this to his higher officials. The former top cop also said that he had ‘punished’ Jayakumar by giving him below average rating in his performance appraisal. “The officer was taken for duty in CCB and was working as Additional Commissioner of Police and was in charge of anti gangster operation. It was felt that he would be sensitive and reliable. He was directed to concentrate on major illegal activities in the city. Intelligence reports indicate that he was aware of a major organised crime activity and did not bring to the notice of the officers. His actions lack discipline and was aimed to.sabotage the aims of well intentioned senior officers who wanted to curb crime in the city,” said George reading out an excerpt from the appraisal. Rubbishing the claims that he was away when the CBI team came knocking at his doors, he said that the CBI officers have taken the sale deed of his TNHB house allotted to him in 1994, his lease documents and insurance policy. The CBI, on Thursday, arrested five persons in connection with the Gutkha scam in Tamil Nadu. The promoters of the Gutkha godown, an SP from the Central Excise and Customs department and an officer from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The arrests came a day after around 40 locations were raided by the CBI sleuths in connection with the scam. Among the locations raided were the houses of TN Health Minister C Vijayabaskar, S George, and DGP TK Rajendran. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

C Christine Fair,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the pilgrimage to Pakistan with the stated goal of achieving a reset by securing Pakistan’s assistance in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table and a real commitment to retard the capabilities of the congeries of Islamist terrorist groups groomed by Pakistan. As the former head of the CIA, Pompeo knows better than most how well US-Pakistani cooperation   work in the ideal state and how badly it usually works in practice. The timing of this visit was ostensibly pegged to the emergence of Imran Khan as the new prime minister following a general election in which the army did everything possible to foist Khan into power while enervating his competition. As Pompeo was about to depart for Islamabad, the Taliban confirmed that Jalaluddin Haqqani had died peacefully at the age of 71 in Afghanistan. Perhaps no event punctuates the desultory nature of the US-Pakistan relationship and the perduring American failures in Afghanistan than the simple fact that Haqqani died not in a drone strike or Pakistani military operation, but unremarkably after a long illness. His death will change nothing on the battlefield: Sirajuddin (one of his twelve sons) had long been the steward of the brutal eponymous terror network and a deputy of the Afghan Taliban. Under Sirajuddin’s guidance, the network executed brutal and audacious attacks in Afghanistan at the behest of Pakistan. But Donald Trump, America’s lubricious and temperamental president, has upended America’s long-standing policy of fiscal cupidity. More so than any other US president since 9/11, Trump presents challenges that Pakistan has yet to confront. His administration disregards diplomatic niceties. Equally discourteous, last week, the US government announced that another $300 million in Coalition Support Fund (CSF) reimbursements would be declined in advance of Pompeo’s announced trip. In fact, by the end of September, all fiscal year 2017 CSF monies will disappear and Pakistan will not have received a cent of it. Pakistan’s army – the primary beneficiary of this programme – is irked because it believes it is entitled to these funds for its own so-called “counter-terrorism operations”, and for allowing the United States to continue using its ground and air space to sustain US operations in Afghanistan and to replenish the Afghan National Security Forces. No one saw this coming (including this author). In the past, US officials lugubriously complained that Pakistan is an epicenter of terror in the region, and even withheld portions of the luxuriant CSF monies, but it continued to bankroll Pakistan nonetheless. The Pakistanis are learning the hard way that Trump is indifferent to Pakistan’s repines. Trump cares about one thing: not being seen as “losing Afghanistan”. Trump is vindictive, vituperative, obsessed with slights, real and imagined, and he will do what he feels is necessary to put pressure on Pakistan. Pakistan has never had to deal with an American president who does not care that Pakistan is too dangerous to fail or whatever hand-wringing excuse Pakistani apologists in Washington offer to defend the status quo. The first reason is simple: Imran Khan has likely learned the limit of his remit. He is the mayor of Islamabad. His jurisdiction excludes Rawalpindi, the seat of the powerful Pakistani Army which dictates the policies on issues the United States cares about. The army – not Imran Khan – will call the shots on Pakistan’s reliance upon   under its ever-expanding nuclear umbrella to harass India and Afghanistan while coercing the international community to indulge its crimes. The second reason is geography and the American logistical demands of remaining in Afghanistan. The United States cannot stay in Afghanistan without logistical routes to supply itself as well as the Afghan National Security Forces. For the former, Washington uses Pakistan airspace, and for the latter, Pakistani ground space. Earlier Trump (likely illegally) withdrew from the multi-lateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear programme and re-imposed sanctions upon Iran and entities doing business with Iran. This effort may well jeopardise the critical Iranian port in Chabahar that Afghanistan vitally needs to become strategically independent upon Pakistan. It is not yet clear, whether India will receive a dispensation from this sanction regime. Trump’s intemperate position on the JCPOA was largely driven by a desire to court the evangelical vote for whom Israel is a critical issue. (Evangelicals believe that Israel is necessary for the second-coming of Jesus and the rapture, after which all Jews will be cast into hell.) Israel (and its back-door ally Saudi Arabia) was opposed to the deal with Iran. However, Chabahar was the only meaningful logistical alternative to Pakistani ports. The much-touted Northern Distribution Network is expensive, complicated by the need for multiple bilateral agreements and frustrated by Russia which seeks to undermine US interests in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Pakistan could simply deny use of either, leaving the United States with no option. Without an alternative, Trump may find himself check-mated by Pakistan. Would the United States be willing to declare war on Pakistan for doing so? With Trump, no one can quite be sure. And that’s not a bad thing in this case. Third and most importantly, simply cutting Pakistan off from American largesse and browbeating Pakistan to “do more” will not produce results. The United States will have to pursue other measures if it hopes to coerce Pakistan to abandon its murderous policies. The fund would likely cut Pakistan off if it weren’t for Washington. Washington does not have a majority of the votes; however, it has the highest share of the votes. Pakistan’s allies on the fund (China, Saudi Arabia and possibly Russia) are not enough to counter the loss of the American support. Withdrawing support makes sense for two reasons. First, the IMF lubricates the friction that would ordinarily arise between a people exploited by the army (which has never won a war except democracy) and that same army that hogs all of the resources while consigning its people to live off of the generosity of others. IMF funding, simply put, is bad for Pakistan because it allows successive leadership to abscond from fiscal responsibility. Second, while Pompeo has said that IMF payments should not service Pakistan’s excessive debt to China, money is fungible. It is impossible to stop Pakistan from taking IMF monies with the right hand and handing it over to China with the left. If Pakistan can count on IMF bailouts, it has no incentive to not accept Chinese efforts to enrich itself at the expense of Pakistanis. While the current measures and insistence that Pakistan “do more” are not likely to produce change, the American tax-payer   no longer has to suffer the indignity of continued payments to Pakistan – the very country which bares the most responsibility for our loss of life in Afghanistan. And for now, I can live with that.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Alok Prasanna Kumar,"As historic as the Constitution bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar vs Union of India is, it helps to remember the long and fraught journey of the litigation to challenge Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. It would also not do any harm to forget the Delhi High Court’s judgment in Naz Foundation vs NCT of Delhi where a two-judge bench of Chief Justice AP Shah and Justice Muralidhar first read down Section 377 to decriminalise consensual sexual acts between consenting adults. The constitutional reasoning for reading down Section 377 are based on a nuanced and careful reading of Articles 14 (guaranteeing equality) and Article 21 (guaranteeing protection of life and liberty). His interpretation included an expanded reading of the term “sex” in Article 15 of the Constitution to include “sexual orientation”, as a protected category against discrimination. In that, Justice Shah was only carrying forward the trend of interpreting the Constitution to meet the needs of the times, rather than sticking strictly to the original interpretation of the words. Likewise, the arguments on dignity and privacy under Article 21. Of course other aspects of privacy related to informational freedom and bodily integrity were not in the picture yet and have only been dealt with in the Puttaswamy case, but it is suffice to say that Justice Shah’s approach towards the constitutional right to privacy has been accepted and built upon by the Supreme Court. He finds that, far from inhibiting the spread of HIV/AIDS, a provision such as Section 377 inhibits public health efforts to combat the same. In this he cut through the clutter and made sense of the utterly contradictory stand taken by the Union government in the case – with the Ministry of Home Affairs arguing that Section 377 should be retained and the Ministry of Health arguing that it need not be. This approach to locating the need for reading down Section 377 in the context of public health finds echo also in the concurring opinions of the judges of the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar. While there had been judgments in the past which have used this concept (Ambedkar himself referred to it famously in a speech to the Constituent Assembly), it was perhaps Justice Shah who used it to the greatest effect in giving richness and depth to the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. One can see the influence by just looking at how often the Supreme Court of India has mentioned it. Of the 26 judgments which use the term (excluding Suresh Koushal which simply cites the relevant passage from Naz Foundation and totally ignores it) 21 were delivered after 2009. It will go down as a failing of the collegium system that a judge of Justice Shah’s calibre did not make it to the Supreme Court. The reason is no secret – it was the animus of one judge of the Supreme Court who was on the collegium at the time that kept Justice Shah out of consideration for elevation to the court. Nevertheless, one can safely say that Justice Shah has had the last laugh. Whatever the vagaries of current events, we can be rest assured that history will be kinder to Justice AP Shah.

Shadab Moizee,"Vivek Gupta “On 15 August and 26 January, the government demands proof of the national anthem being sung in madrasas. But no one cares when we haven’t received salaries in the last 30 months. We are on the brink of starvation.” While saying this, Salma’s eyes were filled with both anger and tears. Ujma had been teaching for over 10 years in a madrasa in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh. She hasn’t received her salary in 30 months. Under the central government’s Scheme to Provide Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM) also known as Madrasa Modernisation Scheme, post-graduate teachers get Rs 12,000 and graduate teachers get Rs 6,000 per month as wages. The state government gives Rs 3,000 to the post-graduate teachers and Rs 2,000 to the graduate teachers. But the madrasa teachers allege that for the last 30 months, they have not received the money that comes in under the SPQEM scheme. Nawab Hussain, the Uttar Pradesh chief of Islamic Madrasa Modernisation Teachers Association of India (AIMMTA), says that both the central and state governments contribute to the teachers’ salaries. But the central government has not sent its portion for the last 30 months. To modernise the madrasas and provide better quality education there, the central government had launched the Scheme to Provide Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM). According to the scheme, subjects like English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science etc. would be taught in the madrasas, apart from Islamic education. Instructors would be recruited for the same. There was also talk of introducing NCERT books and linking them to the syllabus. But , Ajaz Ahmed, President, Islamic Madrasa Modernisation Teachers Association of India (AIMMTA), says “The government may have introduced NCERT syllabus in the madrasas but have not provided any books. The students are losing out on their education. Neither are we getting our wages, nor are the students getting anything.” The madrasa teachers staging a dharna at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar have only one question for the government: will it look after the future of those who are responsible for shaping the future of children?

The Quint,"The Supreme Court on Friday, 7 September, issued a notice to the Centre on three pleas challenging the recent amendment to the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, restoring the provision mandating immediate arrest in the event of a complaint. A bench of Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan sought the Centre's response to the pleas but refused to stay the amended law. ""We can't stay without hearing the other side,"" the bench told the petitioners. The matter has been posted for the next hearing after six weeks. The petitioners – lawyers Prathvi Raj Chauhan, Priya Sharma and an NGO – have challenged the amendment made in the just concluded monsoon session of Parliament by which the lawmakers nullified an apex court verdict removing the provision for immediate arrest. The pleas said the fresh amendments were a violation of the fundamental rights to equality, life and liberty. Comparing the recent amendment with the one brought by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government to overturn the top court verdict in Shah Bano case, the petitioner lawyers have described the provision to arrest as ""arbitrary"" as this would be misused against innocent people. In the Shah Bano case, the top court had awarded maintenance to the divorced Muslim woman, but the then government brought an amendment to overturn the judgment holding that it was an infringement of the Muslim Personal Law. It says the government plea seeking the recall of the apex court order is still pending with the top court. The Lok Sabha on 6 August passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill, 2018, which sought to overturn a Supreme Court order that struck down the provision for immediate arrest. The bill provides that an Investigating Officer will not require the approval of any authority for the arrest of the accused booked under the SC/ST Act. Further, it provides that a preliminary inquiry will not be required for the registration of an FIR against those accused under the Act. On 20 March, the Supreme Court ruled that to arrest persons accused of committing an offence under the said Act, approval of the concerned Senior Superintendent of Police will be required. Many places in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Thursday, 6 September, were affected by the Bharat Bandh called to protest against the changes made in the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The protest saw representation from upper caste organisations. Inversely, Dalit groups had protested in March, post the dilution of the Act by the Supreme Court. In response, the Union government brought an amendment in the monsoon session of Parliament to override the order. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Punjab Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday, 6 September, released a CCTV footage, showing the police action on anti-sacrilege protesters at Kotkapura in 2015. He also released statement of Dr Kulwinderpal Singh, who was allegedly asked by police officers to reach the Kotkapura hospital on 14 October 2015 for any ""eventuality which might arise"" because of “dharna” by the protesters. Holding former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and former Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal responsible for firing at Kotkapura, Sidhu said both of them should be booked as there is ""prima facie evidence"" in the Justice (Retd) Ranjit Singh Commission's report, which probed sacrilege incidents to proceed against them. The footage was procured from different cameras installed at the main road, connecting Moga, Jaitu, Muktsar at Kotkapura in Faridkot, the minister said. In the footage, Sidhu said a large number of Sikhs could be seen sitting in the middle of the road in a tent at around 6.40 am as part of their protest against sacrilege incidents. “When the protesters did not accede to the requests, a large number of police personnel picked up Panthpreet Singh forcibly, leading to commotion there,” he said.

The News Minute,"The CBI, on Thursday, 6 September, arrested five persons in connection with the Tamil Nadu gutkha scam. Promoters of Jayam Industries AV Madhavrao, Uma Shankar Gupta and Srinivas Rao, Dr Senthil Murugan of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and NK Pandian, Superintendent in the Central Excise Department were the ones were arrested by the CBI officers. The accused have been remanded to judicial custody till 20 September. The arrests come a day after the investigating agency conducted extensive raids in around 35 locations -- including Chennai, Thoothukudi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Guntur -- on Wednesday. Among those who were raided were the sitting TN Director General of Police (DGP) TK Rajendran, the ex-DGP S George, Health Minister C Vijayabasker, former Milk and Dairy Development Minister BV Ramanaa. The raids which began at 7.30 am on Wednesday lasted till evening. Premises of the promoters of Jayam Industries -- Madhavrao, Uma Shankar Gupta and Srinivas Rao -- were also raided by the CBI on Wednesday. Jayam Industries was involved in the manufacture of gutkha before it was banned by the Government of Tamil Nadu in May 2013. Following the ban on gutkha, the company allegedly changed its name to Annamalai Industries and continued its business by bribing the concerned officials. Many officials from the sales tax department, FSSAI, police and the Department of Central Excise and Customs were accused of having received a bribe in the case. In May, the Madras High Court transferred the case to CBI based on a plea filed by the DMK and an FIR was registered by the agency in the same month. The diary allegedly had the names of those who were believed to have been paid off by the gutkha manufacturers– and among them allegedly featured the state's health minister. Later, documents showed that an amount of Rs 40 crore was allegedly paid to the Minister and several officials as quid pro quo for facilitating the sale of banned gutkha in Chennai.

Manoj Joshi,"The 2+2 ministerial India-US meeting that concluded in New Delhi on Thursday has been anticipated for a while, and its outcome, at least, at the public level has held no surprises. Given the vast Indo-American agenda covering political ties, trade, defence, immigration, terrorism and regional issues, there was bound to be extensive discussion, and even decisions on a range of subjects. But the focus has been on defence cooperation and the issue of sanctions in relation to Iran and Russia. Not surprisingly, none of the four ministers mentioned either Russia or Iran in their official closing remarks after the talks. But some details on these two issues have emerged through subsequent press conference and briefings. So it is not surprising that the two major announcements emerged in this area. The first was the decision by India to sign up to the US Communications Security Memorandum of Agreement (COMCASA) and the second was that of a major tri-service exercise in India’s east coast in 2019. We should be clear, however, that COMCASA is an enabling agreement. It eases India’s ability to get high-grade US communications equipment. But that does not mean that the US will a) provide that equipment on demand, and b) that we will automatically have access to the high-quality information that the US possesses through its global network. Information exchanges are decided separately, what COMCASA will do is to ease the flow. As for the tri-service exercise, it is a significant development, but part of a continuity of developments ever since India and the US embarked on the current phase of their relations in the mid-1990s. What is important, however, is that the exercise is in the east coast. It excludes what the Indians see as their most important external areas which extends from the western coast to the Saudi peninsula. The token decision here has been that the two sides will work towards having an Indian liaison officer at the US Central Command’s naval centre in Bahrain. Speaking at a press conference in the US Embassy in New Delhi after the meet, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that no decision has been taken by the US in relation to the Indian plans to acquire the S-400 missiles from Russia. Though he did promise that through discussions with India, there could be “an outcome that makes sense for each of our two countries.” He added that the effort was “not to penalize great strategic partners like India.” More than 60 percent of India’s defence equipment comes from Russia and this proportion will only go down marginally in the coming decades, even if India decides not to make major Russian purchases. The Act is draconian: its Section 231 demands sanctions on any “significant transaction” with the defence and intelligence sectors of Russia. This presumably covers not just acquisition of new equipment, but also spares and components relating to existing holdings. Section 235, which describes the sanctions, indicates that they are capable of completely gutting the Indo-Russian relationship. It targets dealings and payments that are linked to the US financial systems, and this more or less covers almost all dollar transactions. The second issue relates to Iran which provides a significant proportion of India’s oil requirements, which are almost completely made up of imports. Iran’s great advantage is its proximity to India, which reduces the cost of transporting the oil. There has been no talk of any waiver here and India is confronted with a major challenge in dealing with the sanctions. At the press conference at the US Embassy, Pompeo made it clear that they see 4 November as the deadline in enforcing the sanctions on countries that continue to import Iranian oil. He provided little comfort in relation to India, but he did say “we will find an outcome that makes sense.” Prime Minister Modi may have had significant meetings with President Xi Jinping and Putin this year, but those are more by way of tactical adjustments to Indian policy whose basic thrust towards closer ties with the US has not changed. This is brought out by the fact that unlike the run-ins with other close allies and partners Trump has ensured that the Indian ties retain a certain primacy in his calculation. The US National Security Strategy issued last December has placed the Indo-Pacific region above Europe and Middle East in terms of American strategic priorities. The designation of India as a “major defence partner” in 2016 had underscored this, as has the more recent decision to put India in a list of countries eligible for Strategic Trade Authorisation Tier -1 licensee exemption. Despite the problems with H1B visas, Indian students are still flooding American universities in large numbers. US companies are doing good business in India and companies like Walmart and Amazon have major plans for India. There are trade issues lurking in the background, primarily related to the USD 23 billion surplus in favour of India. But, as Secretary Pompeo noted, India will attempt to make this up by importing aircraft and energy products from the US. New Delhi has threatened to retaliate, but deferred the implementation of counter-tariffs on a number of US products. Besides Harley Davidson motorcycles, India’s price caps on medical devices has also angered the Americans. It’s not clear whether the 2+2 dialogue took up these issues and found a way out. Notwithstanding all the talk on shared values, democracy and so on, the US has no illusions about India emerging as any kind of a military ally in the region. The time for such alliances has long passed. What it is seeking is a strong and stable country which, in the words of US Defense Secretary James Mattis, will play a role “as a stabilizing force on the region’s geographic front lines.”  By simply being what it is, a large and economically dynamic entity, a significant military power, which broadly shares a world view with the US, India is seen as a key anchor of the western portion of the Indo-Pacific region ranging from South-east Asia to Eastern Africa.       .)

Kabir Taneja,"In 2014, Areeb Majeed, a young man from Kalyan, Maharashtra, attempted with three others to travel to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State. His pro-ISIS radicalisation happened online, via social media. A woman from Philippines named Karen Aisha Hamidon allegedly played a crucial role by flirting with Areeb, and designed a bizarre concoction of sex, jihad and the Promised Land to push him to undertake the journey. The fame of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), which has gained worldwide attention as the most brutal Islamist terror group of our times, would not have been possible without the internet and the reach of broadband connectivity, even in bombed out cities and towns. The fact that ISIS managed to take over the front pages of major global news outlets was by design. The successful weaponisation of the internet by ISIS, using slickly produced videos, glossy magazines et cetera has added a new dimension to the global war on terror; one that is still in the infant stages of being processed into the narratives of the modern day counter-terrorism approach. The initial use of the internet as a major propaganda tool to openly, and defiantly, showcase jihadist violence was executed by Al Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda aligned terror group in East Africa, when it live tweeted its attack on Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya in 2013. While the internet was used for propaganda earlier as well, terror groups, like common citizens, now had access to open social media platforms like everyone else, and potential jihadists now had unfiltered access to jihadist groups themselves. According to researchers Mia Bloom and Chelsea Daymon of Georgia State University, “use of new technologies and its risks should not be overlooked, especially considering that encrypted platforms have become a primary means for radicalisation, recruitment and planning”. Bloom and Daymon in their research paper titled ‘Assessing the Future Threat: ISIS’s Virtual Caliphate’ join a chorus of other researchers such as Charlie Winter and Haroro J Ingram from the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT) at The Hague in highlighting how ISIS has, by design and impeccable execution, changed the way the internet can be used for radicalisation. While Bloom and Daymon use the example of Russia-based encrypted chat app Telegram that dubiously gained global popularity for being the first choice of pro-ISIS activities, the narratives emboldened by such research now demands the digital domain be given the same precedence in counter-terrorism strategies as conventional hard power in all kinds of theatres of conflict. From an Indian perspective, the mechanism to not just monitor but counter threats propagating radicalisation is today inadequate and fairly behind compared to the pace at which the internet is being used for ulterior motives. Many of the pro-ISIS Indian cases investigated by Indian authorities were initially flagged by foreign partner agencies, only then did Indian mechanisms for cyber security spring into action. Kashmir is no stranger to internet blackouts in the state’s attempts to stop stone-pelters and other miscreants, including cross-border terrorists, from organising themselves into groups to take on the security forces along with attempting to check the flow of information in the valley. Even a single person, with access to online communication platforms today has the power to disrupt narratives, if not operations. To put the above in perspective, a few examples can be brought to light. Earlier this year in February, a ‘freelance jihadist’ called Eisa Fazili, who had allegedly broken away from the group Ghazwat al-Hind, killed a policeman in Srinagar, Kashmir. To market his own name in the valley, and also to break through the cluster of local militant groups, Fazili took the opportunity to tap into the world’s most prominent terror name, ISIS. He contacted ISIS’s   online, possibly via the app Telegram where pro-ISIS groups run amok, and claimed he killed the policeman in name of ISIS, pushing the narrative of it being the first ISIS attack on Indian soil. ISIS media channels broadcasted this as an ISIS attack, and within hours an ‘ISIS in Kashmir’ narrative was created once again. The use of the internet offers a vast communication platform that is next to impossible to monitor fully. A woman sitting in the Philippines has the means and power to recognise and play upon a single individual’s fears or insecurities, so much so as to convince him to travel to another country in the name of jihad. This trend is not a one-off, and has been institutionalised as a method by terror organisations, raising the stakes significantly on how states like India, with issues such as Kashmir, will look to counter in its long-term strategies.

Shreya Ila Anasuya,"The Supreme Court, on 6 September, read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised “sexual intercourse against the order of nature.” Since for various reasons Section 377 was used to target people who identify with the LGBTQI community, this is a great thing. But even as we celebrate this victory, we have to remember that the reading down of Section 377 has certainly not been the only or the most pressing issue to do with queer and trans rights in India. Several commentators who have been deeply immersed in working on issues of gender and sexuality have repeatedly pointed out, that we need to look beyond Section 377 – at the violence and discrimination that the most marginalised queer and trans people across India have to face. Caste-based discrimination impacts queer and trans Indians adversely, and there is no affirmative action in place for Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi trans people. Many gender identities (for example people on the trans-masculine spectrum) and sexual orientations (for example asexuality) are severely invisible. Even as more elite queer Indians celebrate the reading down of Section 377 as the end of a long struggle, far more know that this is a symbolic victory that will not protect them from violence in the course of their daily lives. Trans sex workers, homeless queer and trans people, and trans people who beg, will have to contend with the police targeting them. They’ll have to contend with the derision and contempt that those who consider themselves ‘respectable’ are capable of showing towards them, with a lack of access to basic facilities. In 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental rights of transgender people under the Indian Constitution. The NALSA judgment, as it is known, affirmed a variety of rights, including the right to the self-determination of gender identity. The judgement was rightfully celebrated, but its aftermath has been sorry. The text of Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) 2016 Bill was an unmitigated disaster, and many of its provisions stood in direct opposition to the spirit and letter of the historic 2014 judgment. It was only after widespread protests and sustained work by trans rights collectives all over the country, that the Centre agreed to make suggested changes to the Bill. But even these have not included affirmative action in the form of reservations, which the 2014 judgment clearly specified should have been included. But because the judgment exists, there is a framework, using which the community can advocate for its rights, and point out the gaps between what the community is experiencing, and the rights the judgment says it should have unfettered access to.  The judgment was not the end, it was just the starting point. Other laws and proposed laws, including ones that address trafficking and begging, disproportionately and adversely impact trans communities. This is the bitter truth, and clarion call we must keep in mind even as we celebrate the reading down of Section 377. If Section 377 was the beginning and end of your engagement with queer and trans rights in India, this is an opportunity for you to familiarise yourself with the tireless work that collectives have been doing all over the country to address the huge inequalities that pervade the LGBTQ community.

Vishnu Gopinath,"For Indians across the country, 6 September 2018 will be remembered as the day the Supreme Court decriminalised homosexuality and scrapped the parts of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised acts of sex between consenting adults. From Chennai to Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi and many other parts of India, citizens celebrated the victory for fundamental rights and freedom. Just across the border, India’s neighbour Pakistan joined in to congratulate India on the good tidings and the victory in the fight for equal rights for all citizens of India. Journalists were first to congratulate India on the judgment, which scrapped parts of the archaic law that criminalised same sex relationships. Eyinah, the author of Pakistan's first anti-homophobia children's book,   also congratulated India on the massive judgment. Reacting to the judgment, she said, “I’m so thrilled to hear this historic news coming from India. It’s an incredible step forward, towards progress and equality for all. I hope there will be many more steps to come! I also hope that India can serve as an example to others in the subcontinent regarding this, like my motherland, Pakistan. The fact that this news comes during a time of rising far-right politics around the world makes me especially hopeful for the future.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TS Sudhir,"The Insider vs the Outsiders. That, in a nutshell, will be the political strategy that the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) will employ in the assembly elections in the state. The insider is K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the Telangana   who claims that he alone can best represent the interests of the youngest state in India. The outsiders are the Congress, who KCR dismisses as a ‘Delhi party’, and the Telugu Desam, that he dubs as an ‘Andhra party’. With this, KCR has rewound the clock back to pre-2014 when he evoked the Telangana sentiment. At the time, the targets were Andhra political and business interests who, KCR alleged, stymied the progress of the Telangana region. To win a mandate four years later, KCR is banking on the insecurity of the people of Telangana about mortgaging their interests to non-locals. It is a strategic move because the Congress campaign emphasises that it was the party that decided to carve out Telangana state despite suffering a huge political loss in Andhra Pradesh (where it did not win a single MLA or MP seat in 2014). KCR's ploy is to ensure the Congress gets no credit for the decision. He blamed India's first prime minister for having decided to merge the then Hyderabad state (present-day Telangana) with Andhra state on 1 November 1956, despite the misgivings of the Telangana region. Likewise, he blamed Indira Gandhi for not granting statehood to Telangana despite a fierce struggle in 1969. The narrative is to paint the Congress as the “villains of Telangana'”, claiming that the present Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi has inherited the legacy of the Delhi Sultanate. ‘Sultanate’ is an interesting word because it attempts to position KCR as a commoner. In the minds of the rural and semi-rural folk, it creates an image of someone who has risen through the ranks versus a Rahul Gandhi who KCR wants to suggest, has led a privileged existence. Will it click – is the question. Especially when KCR is accused of having splurged Rs 40 crore on building a palatial bungalow for the CM's official residence, throwing austerity to the winds. Will people buy the rhetoric that Telangana Congress leaders are slaves in Delhi, having to wait for hours to secure an audience with Gandhi? This is because KCR is himself seen as inaccessible and accused by the Opposition of displaying a feudal mindset, behaving like a modern-day Sultan. Which perhaps explains the rather pungent attack on the Congress president, even calling him a “buffoon”. Even TRS leaders have not been happy with the choice of words, more so when it was not an election public meeting. But the strategy clearly is to reinforce the ‘Pappu’ narrative to show that Rahul Gandhi cannot be trusted to protect Telangana’s interests. When it comes to pinch-hitting, Chandrababu Naidu remains a favorite target of KCR. There is a hint of worry if the alliance between the Congress and the Telugu Desam could upset the TRS applecart. This is hypocrisy. In the past four years, the TRS has poached 12 of the 15 MLAs who were elected on the TDP ticket. One of them, T Srinivas Yadav was even made a minister. If embracing the TDP legislators was fair, does it make sense to call the Congress’ embracing of the TDP, a  move? The TRS criticism is also about the unethicality of the TDP allying with the Congress, when the party itself was founded by NT Rama Rao in 1982 on an anti-Congress plank. But what the Congress and the TDP are doing is practical politics. With both parties fighting with their back to the wall, they have found common cause in forging an alliance. Both parties are no longer a threat to each other. The Congress, thanks to its decision to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh, is a political zero in the state, and the TDP is no longer the force it used to be in Telangana. He has taken a gamble by advancing elections, buoyed by the surveys that predict a victory. Which makes the period from September 2018 to May 2019 extremely critical, given that KCR will face two elections within a few months of each other. The ‘bodyline’ series starts now.

The Quint,"Thousands of workers and farmers have congregated in Delhi, to participate in the Mazdoor Kisan Sangharsh Rally in protest against the “anti-people policies of the Centre.” Among the demands being raised by the protesters are debt waivers for farmers, guarantee of minimum wage and stricter enforcement of labour laws. The march is being organised jointly by CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions), AIKS (All India Kisan Sabha) and AIAWU (All India Agriculture Workers Union), along with organisations and unions affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Starting from Ramlila Maidan, the protest march went to Parliament Street, and will later reach Jantar Mantar. The 5 September protest by workers and farmers in Delhi will not be the last rally, the organisers had said on Tuesday, warning that they would intensify their struggle against the ""anti-people"" policies of the Centre. CITU general secretary Tapan Sen had told reporters on Friday, 31 August: 32-year-old Jayshree Deshmukh has covered a distance of 1216 kilometres in nearly 24 hours to participate in the Kisan-Sangharsh mazdoor rally.  It was no less than a challenge for Shamsher Punia and his 20 fellow farmers from Hissar to participate in the protests. They collected money to come to Delhi with the help of farmer’s donation.  Shankar Waghmare is a labour who has walked from Nashik to Delhi. He does not have a stable livelihood. After the Kharif crop is harvested, he has to sit idle for months.

Zeke Miller Catherine Lucey,"In a striking anonymous broadside, a senior Trump administration official wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times on Wednesday, 5 September, claiming to be part of a group of people ""working diligently from within"" to impede President Donald Trump's ""worst inclinations"" and ill-conceived parts of his agenda. Trump said it was a ""gutless editorial"" and ""really a disgrace”, while his press secretary called on the official to resign. Trump later tweeted, ""TREASON?"" and in an extraordinary move demanded that if ""the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"" The writer, claiming to be part of the ""resistance"" to Trump but not from the left, said: The newspaper described the author of the column only as a senior official in the Trump administration. ""It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,"" the author continued. ""We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't."" A defiant Trump, appearing at an unrelated event at the White House, lashed out at the Times for publishing the op-ed. ""They don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them,"" he said of the newspaper. The op-ed pages of the newspaper are managed separately from its news department. The essay immediately triggered a wild guessing game as to the author's identity on social media, in newsrooms and inside the West Wing, where officials were blindsided by its publication. And in a blistering statement, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the author of choosing to ""deceive"" the president by remaining in the administration. ""He is not putting the country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people,"" she said. Sanders also called on the Times to ""issue an apology"" for publishing the piece, calling it a ""pathetic, reckless, and selfish op-ed."" White House officials did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate on Trump's call for the writer to be turned over to the government or the unsupported national security ground of his demand. To White House officials, the ultimatum appeared to play into the very concerns about the president's impulses raised by the essay's author. Trump has demanded that aides identify the leaker, according to two people familiar with the matter, though it was not yet clear how they might go about doing so. The two were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The text was pulled apart for clues: The writer is identified as an ""administration official""; does that mean a person who works outside the White House? The references to Russia and the late Senator John McCain — do they suggest someone working in national security? Does the writing style sound like someone who worked at a think tank? In a tweet, the Times used the pronoun ""he"" to refer to the writer; does that rule out all women? The newspaper later said the tweet referring to ""he"" had been ""drafted by someone who is not aware of the author's identity, including the gender, so the use of 'he' was an error."" Others argued that the word ""lodestar"" could have been included to throw people off. Showing her trademark ability to attract attention, former administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman tweeted that clues about the writer's identity were in her recently released tell-all book, offering a page number: 330. The reality star writes on that page: ""many in this silent army are in his party, his administration, and even in his own family."" The assertions in the column were largely in line with complaints about Trump's behavior that have repeatedly been raised by various administration officials, often speaking on condition of anonymity. And they were published a day after the release of details from an explosive new book by longtime journalist Bob Woodward, that laid bare concerns among the highest echelon of Trump aides about the president's judgment. The writer of the Times op-ed said Trump aides are aware of the president's faults and ""many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. I would know. I am one of them."" The writer also alleged ""there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment"" because of the ""instability"" witnessed in the president. The 25th Amendment allows the vice president to take over if the commander in chief is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" It requires that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet back relieving the president. The writer added: ""This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state."" (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Meghnad Bose,"In middle school, I remember mocking a friend of mine by calling him “gay”. I remember throwing around the word as an insult, one that was especially reserved for “the effeminate guys”. Many of my classmates used the phrase, “He is   like a girl only.” It is with shame that I admit, I did so too. A decade later, I am all set to make my way to the Supreme Court, to report on what is going to be a momentous day in the history of our nation, and its LGBTIQ+ community. My excitement has not allowed me to sit still all evening, and is making me type out this article in the middle of the night. It is 1:21 am right now. Over the last several years, I have been a passionate advocate for LGBTQ rights. Right now, all that is on my mind is the feverish hope that the Supreme Court will decriminalise homosexuality and bring queer Indians one step closer to the equality they deserve. There isn’t really a straight answer to that, so why don’t you come along as I go down memory lane, revisiting the incidents that shaped my understanding of homosexuality and my views on the community. I was still in school. The debate on homosexuality had reached peak popularity on television debates – self-appointed spokespersons of various faiths were uniting in their opposition against the decriminalisation of homosexuality, and the debates were getting shriller every night. My father, quite a religious person, had organised a kind of talk at home. A monk from the Ramakrishna Math was to give a speech. Now, at the end of his speech, this particular  (as senior monks in the Ramakrishna Math are called), started answering questions from the audience. So up went my hand. And I asked: I somewhat remember the silence that dawned upon the room, and vaguely recall the monk dodging and sidestepping the question to give a generic answer. But what I cannot forget is what my father told me about the incident a couple of days later. Much to my delight, my father told me that he had defended me, “All he did was ask a question, Sir. He just asked a question.” I may not have got my answers just then, but I began to have a hunch that this stigma around homosexuality, and the conservatism that demanded we not talk about it, couldn’t possibly be a good thing. Slowly, but surely, the veil was lifting. I was a mischievous kid in Class 7, always up to some prank or the other. Cracking a joke here, stepping on someone’s toes there. One day, in an English Language period, when our teacher Mr Paul was announcing the syllabus for the coming exam, I made a comment in the classroom that got me into trouble. Mr Paul initially said that we would have homophones in the syllabus. Then, after a while, he corrected himself, “No, not homophones, sorry. We will have homonyms in the syllabus.” I piped up in class, “Sir, decide no, homo-what will we have?” Some of my classmates burst into laughter. My teacher saw red. In no time, I found myself being taken to the Middle School in-charge’s office. Mr Gunnion’s office was a place no middle schooler would want to be in if they could avoid it. So, as I stood punished outside his office, waiting for him to return, the fear was real. Would my parents be called? Would I be punished further? But, you know what, I’ll never forget what Mr Gunnion did that day. When he finally walked into his office and my teacher explained what had gone down in class, Mr Gunnion sized me up. And then he said, “The word you were making fun of is ‘homosexual’. You know what homosexual means?” I was quiet. I didn’t, to be honest. Today, around 12 years later, as I write this, my eyes are welling up with tears, remembering the difference one teacher can make. Mr Gunnion was the first person in any position of authority in my life, heck, he was the first person ever in my life to tell me that homosexuality was normal. As normal as anything else. A teacher who explained instead of punishing. A teacher who understood, and helped reform a student’s thought, not by a slap, but by a talk. Thank you, Sir. I wish we had more like you, though. Because throughout my school life, we never discussed homosexuality or LGBTQ rights in the classroom. The taboo was as strong inside the class, as outside it. And without learning about it properly, all we picked up were the jokes we heard from our seniors, in the neighbourhood, and the occasional trashy film. The jokes whose punchlines were “the gays”. The jokes we should have been taught not to make, or laugh at. In my second year of college, one of my closest friends sat me down for a talk, and told me he was gay. It may seem like a small thing, but it isn’t. Not because it affected our friendship in any way. Not because I told him something I shouldn’t have. But because it made me realise that there are those around me who have to live most of their personal lives in secrecy, hiding their identity from even those they know and love. For whom romance comes laced with fear of being found out and subjected to harassment. It made me realise that being quiet about the discrimination that my friend suffered, was not an option. It made me understand that unless we join the fight for equality, we are complicit in keeping them unequal. You may argue that I am insensitive to need someone to come out to me to realise that. Maybe I am, but that is what hit home for me. In 2013, when the Supreme Court re-criminalised homosexuality, I was angry. My friend, who had come out to more people in the past couple of years than he ever had, with his confidence boosted by the Delhi High Court’s judgment reading down Section 377, had his hopes shattered again. A fresh round of injustice had just been dealt. I do not cry often at the movies. But while watching Hansal Mehta’s   in 2016, I cried in the hall like I never had. For around half the film’s duration, I wept my eyes out. Why? Because I knew it was true. Every single time I saw the injustice that our cruel society meted out to Manoj Bajpayee on screen, I remembered that Professor Siras had been a living, breathing human being who faced these injustices in real life. Someone who was punished by a harsh, intolerant, homophobic nation that could not accept him as their own. I cried because I wondered how many Professor Sirases there have been, and continue to be, in India. How many more individuals do we continue to repress, merely because they do not fit a bigoted definition of “normal”? I cried, in shame. These are the experiences that have changed me. From being an insensitive, uninformed individual who bandied around a word to insult others, to being a part of the movement that is about to make history today. It’s 7:51 am right now. I have to get ready to leave for the Supreme Court. It’s going to be a historic day. And I couldn’t be prouder to report this from the ground. So I have a request to all of you who are reading this today and think that being queer is “abnormal” or “unnatural”. No human being is lesser for whom they love. No matter whom they love. If I could make the change, then so can you. For the sake of the equality that our Supreme Court can direct, but that eventually you and I must observe, will you? Please?

Sanjay Deshpande,"Growing up queer in India wasn’t very easy. My teenage years were filled with confusion, doubt and uncertainty. I always knew that I was different. But I didn’t know how or why. So when I finally found out, it felt like I had been slapped so hard that my ears rang with pain and my whole body felt numb. I had heard people around me make fun of non-straight men all my life.  was the most common way to tease any boy who didn’t do the regular boy things – playing sports, wrestling with classmates, spending hours playing video games. And boy, was I teased and bullied! Why am I different? Why can’t I be like others? Why was I being punished?. It took a lot of energy and courage to fight the depression dementors. I have often wondered – how many queer people must have considered ending their lives, especially the ones who have no access to the right kind of information on sexuality and orientation? But, I found my refuge in the internet. If I hadn’t encountered the LGBTQ+ organisation  , if I hadn’t found out that there were others like me, I would have given up a long time ago. These people may not have been in my immediate vicinity, but they were out there, somewhere. However, while I was able to read that people like me existed, I couldn’t find any Indian resources. So I told myself, like any naive adolescent would have, that this isn’t a part of ‘our’ culture. The Delhi High Court judgment came out in 2009. I vividly remember the day, 2 July 2009. I was in my 12th standard. On the day after the judgment, we had a free period. The whole class was sent to the library. I picked up a newspaper and seated myself in a corner. The minute I got to reading it, I saw the main headline. Homosexuality had been decriminalised. I was too young to fathom what this meant. But, I used this opportunity to read up on it as much as I could. Things were finally looking up. Over the next few years, I mustered the courage to come out to my friends. I lost some on the way, but those who stayed are the ones I know will stay with me for the rest of my life. I even started meeting other queer people. But, I was fighting a different battle now. I was turning the world into a less homophobic place, by coming out to it, one person at a time. The 2009 judgment played a huge role in me becoming the person I am today. Strong, confident, independent and just comfortable in my own skin. By 2013, I had graduated from college. I knew that there were petitions filed in the Supreme Court to overturn the 2009 Delhi High Court judgment. But, like everyone else from the community, I thought that this was a no-brainer – they would be rejected. I was shell-shocked when the judgment came out. It felt like I had been stripped of my respect and dignity in front of the whole world. For a while, I just couldn’t believe it. I was in denial. How could this happen? I had come out to most people in my life. How was I supposed to hide it now? Was I supposed to go back into the closet? Did this mean I could no longer be an equal citizen of this country? I was livid. But, more than anything else, I feared for my life. For those of you who are unaware, Section 377 criminalizes “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”. This could be any kind of non-penovaginal sex. However, it is never used to persecute straight people. Historically, Section 377 has been used to blackmail gay men and transgenders. The 2013 Supreme Court judgment set us back by years. But, more than anything else, it crushed the emotional wellbeing, self-acceptance, confidence, hopes, dreams and aspirations for queer people across the country. I started to live constantly under the fear of being caught, blackmailed, and harassed. I think a lot of us have had to make changes to our life and career plans. We didn’t feel respected or safe in our own country. But today is a different day. The Supreme Court has made it one, by finally decriminalising homosexuality. For a long time now, I have been waiting, with bated breath, to be able to say this publicly, without having to worry about violating the law, or getting persecuted -  To be honest, Section 377 was never about sex. The battle we’ve fought isn’t just for our right to have consensual sex with a partner of our choice.

Delivering separate but concurring judgments, a five-judge bench of the apex court said it is the constitutional and not social morality which will prevail. Chief Justice Dipak Misra, also speaking for Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, said a persons attitude and mentality has to change to accept the others' identity and accept what they are and not what they should be. Justice Rohinton Nariman, Justice D.Y.

The Quint,"Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Thursday, 6 September, announced a list of 105 candidates after dissolving the state assembly, thereby paving way for an early election. Addressing a press conference after meeting Governor ESL Narasimhan, Rao said that the future of Telangana should be decided by the people of Telangana and not by Delhi. “I appeal to people, let us not become slaves to Congress, slaves to Delhi.    ,” Rao said. However, even as rumours about Rao’s growing affinity to the BJP are rife, Rao said the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a secular party and won’t be joining hands with the BJP. Governor ESL Narasimhan has approved the dissolution as recommended by the chief minister and has asked him to continue as the caretaker CM till the new government is formed. Chief Minister Rao had convened the cabinet meet at 1 pm at Pragati Bhavan, his official residence, which was abuzz since morning with the arrival of ministers and top officials. The cabinet then passed a resolution, recommending Governor ESL Narasimhan to dissolve the Assembly. TRS sources said KCR chose 6 September for the key decision as he considers '6' his lucky number. This is the reason cited for not taking the decision during the cabinet meeting on 2 September, which was held hours before the massive public meeting organised by the party to sound the poll bugle. KCR will formally launch the TRS election campaign with a public meeting at Husnabad in Siddipet district on Friday. Christened 'Prajala Aasirwada Sabha', this will be the first of 100 public meetings planned by TRS over the next 50 days. KCR stopped short of making the announcement of dissolving the Assembly in a party rally on Sunday in Ranga Reddy district. According to a report in  , KCR might be hoping to win a bigger mandate, because of which he has taken the decision to dissolve the Assembly. Earlier, in 2014, KCR came to power by winning 63 seats in a 119-seat assembly. Secondly, another report in   suggests that KCR doesn’t want to dent his chances of emerging as a key player in the 2019 elections in the light of his growing affinity with the BJP. Speaking to the daily, KCR’s son and IT Minister, KT Rama Rao said, “If at all the elections are held early it will help the TRS. We will win both the state as well as Lok Sabha polls convincingly. Holding early elections will give us ample room to find potential partners for 2019 polls.” Another argument that has been put forth is that the political observers said TRS is keen for early elections as the party believes that simultaneous elections to Assembly and Lok Sabha may not help it highlighting welfare and developmental works undertaken during the last four years.

Tuneer Mukherjee,"The inaugural 2+2 Strategic and Diplomatic Dialogue between India and the United States is being held at a critical juncture. A lot has transpired since Prime Minister Modi met President Trump in Washington more than a year ago, and there is a host of issues that require an honest evaluation from both sides. While it is expected that the final negotiations of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) and other high-level defense exchanges under the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) will take center stage, both sides will also need to clarify their respective positions vis-à-vis Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. Therefore, when India’s Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj meet their American counterparts, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 6 September, they will be expected to dive into the specificities of what unites and divides the two countries on the strategic front. COMCASA will allow joint operability and secure communications between the armed forces of the two nations, enabling more complex military exercises. Furthermore, the agreement will facilitate better synchronization of American military platforms in the Indian armed forces, and open the door for future transfers of high-end military equipment. On the eve of the talks, India approved the purchase of helicopters, howitzers and air defense missile systems worth around Rs 46,000 crore including 24 naval multi-role MH-60 ‘Romeo’ choppers worth Rs 13,500 crore. Other such deals can be expected during the dialogue, especially after the US granted Strategic Trade Authorisation (STA-1) status to India. Discussions should also be expected on the use of space technologies for military purposes, cybersecurity cooperation, the Indo-US Joint Working Group on Aircraft Carrier Technology Cooperation (JWGACTC), information sharing on white shipping, and coordination on emerging technologies between the Indian Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO) and the US Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx). Secretary Pompeo has paid a visit to newly-installed Pakistani premier Imran Khan on his way to the 2+2 dialogue, and India will expect him to be doubly clear with Prime Minister Khan about America’s disapproval of an extremist friendly Islamabad. Similarly, Afghanistan is a crucial arena for both nations, especially at a time when the frail civilian administration in Kabul is losing ground to the Taliban in the rural areas. Any American withdrawal strategy from Afghanistan is central to India’s future strategic course in the country, and both sides need a frank discussion on how to manage the region post-withdrawal. The key plank that binds the strategic partnership between the two nations and calls for closer coordination is the growing strategic influence of China in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing has unabashedly seized upon strategic space in the South China Sea through its construction of artificial islands and has built a vast network of interdependencies in Asia through its infrastructure development under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The political emergency in Maldives and China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean also require a synchronized line. Moreover, the future of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue also hangs in balance as India and the US chart out a coordinated strategic direction. Yet, despite progress on these fronts, New Delhi needs to be cautious about how it approaches the talks. Washington in recent times, has allowed India to dictate the pace at which the bilateral strategic partnership should proceed, but its patience might be wearing thin. Everything from free trade to security alliances has been put on the table as a bargaining chip to exact the outcomes that President Trump desires. India needs to be cognizant of this transactional nature during the upcoming dialogue. The US will demand concessions from India on its military dealings with Moscow and its economic dealings with Iran, while expecting closer strategic coordination on its ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ strategy in countering China. As Randall Schriver, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense, recently noted, a waiver to India on sanctions relating to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) is not guaranteed if New Delhi goes ahead with the purchase of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems from Moscow. The waiver under CAATSA remains at the discretion of President Trump. Likewise, the vitriolic nature of President Trump’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and reinstatement of sanctions on Tehran, begs the question, if this US administration is willing to go easy on India, if New Delhi continues to purchase oil and natural gas from Iran. Indian policymakers on their end need to consider the substance of all these relationships and stand firm on its own priorities while balancing its position with a US that desires more commitment in managing the fluid dynamics of Asian security. Heading into a major election year, Prime Minister Modi is reticent from openly confronting China, as evidenced by the Wuhan summit, and is also conscious of putting all its eggs in Washington’s basket by disengaging with partners like Iran and Russia. The potential of strategic coordination between the two nations is enormous, and both sides need to realize that a lot more than sanctions and visas are at play. America’s diplomatic tussle with Russia and Iran, and India’s reticence on fully committing to the US militarily, reveal a divergence, that cannot be insulated any further. When the four cabinet officials meet on 6 September, their differing views need accommodation from each other. India, on its part, needs to realise that cooperation with the US cannot reach its full potential if it remains uncompromising with Washington on multiple fronts. At the same time, the US needs to realise that India’s diplomatic relationships in Asia need to be carefully managed and cannot be overhauled at a moment’s notice. History can’t be written twice, and both sides need to make sure that the 2+2 dialogue provides the right direction to the India-US relationship in the years to come.

Mayank Mishra," Purnendu Pritam & Vishal Kumar  Hera Khan Demonetisation has elicited a wide range of responses, and the sum of all that has been: It has caused great damage, while the gains have been few and far between. The discussion was revived after the publication of RBI's annual report. So let us look at some of the side-effects of demonetisation that can be gleaned from the report. People have started saving in cash, meaning that a major part of domestic savings is now in cash. The amount of household savings in cash is almost equal to the amount deposited in banks, and the proportion of cash is more than twice the average of the last five years. To get a sense of the impact this will have, please read a few words of the RBI report report. It says that household savings constitute a major source of investment. If the savings are not reaching the banking system, this means that the investment source is drying up. And if this is the case, then it means that businesses will not grow and employment opportunities will stagnate. The second side-effect has been the sluggish performance of the manufacturing sector. The RBI report says: The third side-effect of demonisation is seen in credit growth. Weeks after demonetisation, credit growth touched a historic low. The recovery since then has been muted. According to the Reserve Bank's data, the growth in the loans given to the industry is less than 1 percent even in 2018. This includes the loans given to small and medium enterprises. Due to this, growth in business will slow down, which will also hit employment opportunities. These have been the three major side-effects of demonetisation. On the credit side, some argue, there has been surge in direct tax collection. On average, between 2008-14, tax collection was increasing at the rate at which the country's GDP was growing. During the first two years of the NDA rule, this growth saw a fall. If the nominal GDP growth was 10 percent, tax collection grew by, let us say, 6 to 8 percent. That situation changed somewhat in two subsequent years. But can that be considered a miraculous change after demonetisation? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Over 8,000 people had gathered from various constituencies across the state. After paying his respects to M Karunanidhi at the memorial, he spoke to the press; On being asked if he would be reinstated into the party, and what he thought of the ouster, he had this to say: Alagiri had promised to take out a ‘peace rally’ to mourn the death of his father two days ago. On 13th August, Alagiri also warned of dire consequences if he were not reinstated into the DMK and said: The ‘peace rally’ could well be a show of strength, to force the DMK into reinstating him into the party. He has a large, loyal following across Madurai and neighboring districts, and will likely split the DMK’s votes, if he were to stand as an individual candidate. While Karunanidhi never professed open support for either Alagiri or Stalin, he did have an obvious hand in shaping the latter's career. Shortly before Alagiri's removal from the party in 2014, Karunanidhi announced M K Stalin as his political heir. This announcement remained unquestioned until Karunanidhi's death.

Anthony Rozario,"After spending nearly three decades in the valley, David Devadas had made up his mind to leave Jammu and Kashmir. The journalist’s decision had pained many, including three students, who showed up at his residence in the January 2016. “Don’t go, they pleaded. I told them I was leaving the day after and couldn’t stay on,” Devadas said. The next morning, Devadas woke up to the “unforgettable sight” of a snowfall. As he lay in bed, the author began thinking about the “indescribable beauty of this place and the warmth of its people. I then decided to stay back. This meant, I also witnessed the unrest that followed.” His experience of Kashmir its modern-day tussle, culminated in the form of a book titled  , which was released on Tuesday, 4 September 2018. Apart from the two protracted phases of unrest, Devadas also witnessed protests that broke out in Kashmir, following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in 2016. One of the chapters in his book, says Devadas, deals with hateful polarization, that has “progressed more and more since 2010.” When Devadas started writing the book, “he thought it was about a minority of young people who’ve grown up in violence.” But, by the time he finished writing it, he realized it was about “the majority.” Those who were on the streets in 2008, maintained Devadas, were not the same people who had come out protesting in 2016. In 2008, protests had broken out over the Centre’s proposal to transfer over 99 acres of land in the state to the Amarnath Shrine Board for developing temporary shelters for pilgrims. In each of the three phases of protests that Devadas witnessed closely, the causes and participants were broadly different. While in 2008, “it was about people outside the state taking possession of land and about the Kashmiri Identity, in 2010, it was a cry for a rule of law.” But with the killing of Burhan Wani by security forces in 2016, the protests in the valley were clearly “in support of the acclaimed militant.” Amitabh Matoo, who served as an advisor to Mehbooba Mufti, was part of a panel discussion on Kashmir, moderated by veteran journalist Barkha Dutta. When Dutt asked if the PDP-BJP alliance could have added the situation on the ground, Matoo said “the late Mufti Mohammed Sayed did not personally know PM Modi and assumed he was a pragmatic, Vajpayee-like figure. He had the chutzpah of keeping the vision intact. But after him, it just collapsed.” If the alliance was deeply unpopular and had collapsed after Sayed’s death, asked Barkha, why did the PDP not pull out? Though defensive of Mehbooba’s decision, Matoo feels the former J&K Chief Minister could have pulled out of the government earlier. But this, he says, would have led to another set of government. After the BJP went to press, declaring that it was withdrawing from the government, Mehbooba Mufti resigned as Chief Minister on 19 July 2018. In most of her interactions with the media and meetings with the Centre, Mehbooba Mufti had constantly stressed the need for dialogue, both within and outside Kashmir. Pakistan, largely believed to have sponsored unrest and terrorism in the valley, is an important part of this dialogue process. Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of  , said that whether one “likes it or not, Pakistan is a party to the problem. You have to engage with Pakistan and there’s no getting away from dialogue.” Buttressing his argument in favour of dialogue, Varadarajan said every time India had reached out to Pakistan, things would “cool down in the valley.” He felt this promise of engagement, which was a part of the alliance’s spelt-out agenda, officially known as the common-minimum programme, failed to take shape on the ground. Under the Prime Minister Modi, asserts Varadarajan, “not only was the door of dialogue with Pakistan shut, but no effort was made either, to pursue any domestic track.” He further maintains that the mandate PM Modi’s BJP came in with, should have emboldened him to walk the talk. Instead “he squandered and lost an opportunity,” adds Varadarajan. So where does a broken alliance, rising militancy and a complete mistrust in the political system leave India’s sensitive state? David Devadas felt that the situation looks only depressing. “The impression of politicians among the youth is falling. The teenagers today talk about not being able to speak out and make their voices heard. The anger, the belief is beyond belief.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Broken stretches of Diamond Harbour Road, the Taratala flyover and the Majerhat bridge had received a new topping of bitumen because Mamata was scheduled to travel to neighbouring Behala on 14 August. The said stretches, which were to fall on the CM’s route for the visit, were riddled with potholes. After hearing about Mamata’s prospective visit, the Public Works Department (PWD) completed the repair work in three days straight. ""Repairs started on the flyover and the bridge late on Thursday (9 August) and were completed by Friday (10 August) morning,"" a police officer told  . That’s right, it only took the PWD one night to coat the Majerhat Bridge and the Taratala flyover. According to   15 August report, this job would have normally taken the PWD around a month. Here is why: The chief engineer forwards the file to the secretary of the department in order to procure financial approval and a tender is then floated. This means that the estimate for the repair work travels through four levels before it is approved. Contractors get seven to 21 days to bid for work. However, in August 2018, the process followed was evidently different. As reported by  , sometimes when a VIP is expected to visit, a spot tender is called immediately to choose the contractor. On being asked how the roads were repaired so promptly, a senior PWD engineer claimed: A local police officer had, however, previously told Telegraph India, ""it is we who usually request them to repair potholed roads, and more often than not, they don't pay heed.""

Nishtha Gautam,"“Our foreign policy shall prioritise strengthening our time-tested friendship with India,” opens the foreign policy section of Bhutan’s incumbent Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay’s party manifesto. The Himalayan nation is gearing up for its third general elections, and in no unclear terms does it state its commitment to bolstering the five-decade-old bilateral ties it shares with India. While the PDP and the DPT— having governed the nation at least once— are more eloquent and clear-sighted about the granular details of Bhutan’s foreign policy goals, the two new entrants, the BKP and the DNT, are still finding their political and diplomatic vocabulary. All the four parties in the political fray underscore the importance of self-reliance and sovereignty. For Bhutan, a large part of its internal socio-economic well-being is a function and outcome of its relationship with the neighbouring countries. Any party in power will have this Sword of Damocles hanging over their head. The PDP and the DPT pledge employment generation—a prime concern among the Bhutanese youth today—and seem to rely heavily on the hydropower projects that India has a key role to play in. Interestingly, the DNT has articulated that the reliance on electricity for job creation is a bit exaggerated. Their manifesto says, “Although electricity is, by far, given huge importance in the country’s economy, there are limited youth employment opportunities in the sector, especially in view of the nature of jobs.” All the parties also appear intent on expanding their exports to achieve desired economic growth. The party may be addressing a constituency that believes that living under India’s shadow may not be the ideal state of existence for Bhutan. The DPT, on the other hand, is seeing India as a facilitator for its third-country exports plan, seeking to utilise the river ports of Brahmaputra. “We like India but we don’t like Indians, we don’t like China but we like the Chinese,” says an urban Bhutanese. While it may sound unpleasant, the statement tells the twin tale of minor and major irritants that the Bhutanese deal with. The nation is torn between the Chinese aggression along its borders and the hordes of Sunday tourists entering Bhutan through the Jaigaon-Phuentsholing gate haggling with local vendors. Bhutan sees itself as a proud nation and the perceived arrogance of Indian officials on deputation, who accord little importance to the Bhutanese culture, also does not go down well with them. Yes, comparing China’s menacing countenance on the border with India’s patronising demeanour is a bit of a stretch, but the Bhutanese are better off without both. The Bhutanese got the real taste of their geopolitically precarious position during the Doklam standoff of 2017 involving India and China. They are beginning to speculate that their relationship with India is not without terms and conditions. Yet, the scales are still tipping in India’s favour. The DPT and the two new parties do not mention China even once in their manifestos. Only the PDP bothers to mention, almost nonchalantly, “We shall continue the ongoing border negotiations with China.” The Bhutanese are still not looking at China as an ally or even an economic benefactor. The ruling PDP’s failure in bringing down the national debt—India remains the primary creditor extending significant hydro power loans to Bhutan—is said to have given the pro-China lobby some ammunition but the manifestos tell a different tale altogether. Disgruntlement about the power-tariff negotiations aside, Bhutan may not be looking for a replacement yet. India, however, will be ill-advised to take this goodwill for granted especially in the light of the Nepal conundrum. Post 2015-16 blockade in the Terai, India lost significant diplomatic ground, which China has been too eager to occupy ever since. A Nepal 2.0 avatar of Bhutan does not suit India at all, the Bhutanese are wary of it, too. China, however, is unlikely to waste time in exploiting a situation like this. It acted with alacrity in Nepal. For a 10-year-old democracy, Bhutan has done a good job of keeping religion and politics apart despite the fact that constitutionally speaking, Bhutan identifies itself as a Budhhist nation. No monk or nun, Buddhist or otherwise, can stand for office or even vote. In contrast, Bhutan’s neighbours are witnessing a bigger conflation of politics and religion. Bhutan shares religious links with both India and China. Of late, Indian polity has found itself entangled in a communal discourse. The chinks in the armour of the world’s largest democracy are there for all to see. Bhutan, perhaps, seeks more reassurances from India, and not just on Doklam.

The Quint,"The Tamil Nadu police on Monday, 3 September, arrested Lois Sofia, a student from Thoothukudi for allegedly shouting slogans against the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. The incident took place inside the Thoothukudi airport. She was granted unconditional bail on Tuesday, 4 September. Her father was asked by Tamilselvi, the chief judge in a panel of three judges, that he assure the court that Sofia doesn’t cause such problems again. The police had initially taken action based on a complaint by Tamil Nadu BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was travelling in the same flight as Sofia, reported  . Sofia had been sent to 15-day judicial custody and an FIR has been filed against her under Indian Penal Code Sections 290 (Punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for), 505 (Statements Conducing to Public Mischief) as well as Section 75(1) of the Tamil Nadu City Police Act, 1888. Tamilisai claimed that Sofia, a student from the University of Montreal in Canada, shouted slogans against the BJP government inside the aircraft. “When I am taking my bag, a customer shouts ‘BJP’s fascist government down, down.’ Is that freedom of speech?” According to  , the BJP president engaged in a verbal altercation with the student while the police personnel stationed at the airport tried to calm her down. Speaking to reporters outside the Thoothukudi airport after the incident, Tamilisai had said: Sofia’s advocate Athisiya Kumar said that the Tamil Nadu BJP president could have dealt with the issue in a better way. He added that Sofia is firm that she will not apologise to Tamilisai. “She (Tamilisai) is a good doctor, a senior leader. Couldn't she have just spoken to her, instead of shaming her in public? She (Lois Sofia) is just a student. It's so common to do this in Canada. We don't have that freedom in India. Instead of advising her, she has insulted her. She also instigated her cadres who have been even more vulgar,” he told  . On Tuesday, Tamilisai Soundararajan said that she stands by her action of filing a complaint against Lois Sofia. Speaking to reporters on 3 September, she said: She was further quoted by   as saying: In another statement to CNN News18, Soundararajan said: She had also tweeted against the support Sofia received by leaders in the state. Actor-politician Kamal Haasan tweeted in support of Lois Sofia. “If raising your voice in public spaces is a crime, then all politicians should be put behind bars.

AP,"Prolonging the uncertainty over who will fill the late John McCain's US Senate seat, the governor of Arizona on Tuesday, 4 September, announced the appointment of former Senator Jon Kyl but said he has only committed to serve until the end of the year. Kyl, a Republican who retired from the Senate in 2012 to spend more time with his family, is currently shepherding Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. Kyl's appointment will make it possible for him to vote for the nomination. Governor Doug Ducey, also a Republican, said Kyl was ""the best possible person, regardless of politics"" for the job, and he hopes Kyl serves past the end of the year. If Kyl does leave the Senate after the end of the current congressional term next 3 January, Arizona's governor can appoint another senator for the remaining year. By state law the senator will have to be a member of the same party as the departing one, in this case the GOP. The GOP is hoping Kyl will be a more reliable partisan vote than McCain, whose opposition to a partial repeal of President Obama's health care law pitched the party into turmoil last year. Kyl is well-respected in Arizona and has been able to avoid many of the battles with activists that complicated McCain's career and that of the state's other senator, Jeff Flake, who is retiring because his feud with Trump made his re-election impossible. Kyl's entire career in Washington overlapped with McCain's, and he served with the state's senior senator for three terms before stepping down. Kyl carved out a profile as a reliable conservative vote and a foreign policy expert. Doug Cole, a veteran Republican consultant and former McCain aide, said Kyl was a good, safe pick. ""I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now,"" he said. An attorney, Kyl speaks in a formal, reserved manner that is a sharp contrast to President Trump, and he belongs to an older, less populist vanguard of the GOP. At a news conference where he was introduced as McCain's replacement, Kyl said in a response to a question that he's only met Trump once, though he noted he is working for the White House by serving as Kavanaugh's so-called ""sherpa."" The unusual timing of Kyl's appointment could work out for another Arizona Republican who wants to become a US senator — Republican Martha McSally. She's currently locked in a tough campaign against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema for the Senate seat Flake is vacating. Should she lose, McSally — a former Air Force colonel who once worked on Kyl's staff — could be appointed to the McCain seat if Kyl vacates it in January. The choice of Kyl will also have political consequences for Ducey. He's up for re-election this November against Democratic challenger David Garcia. For Republican voters who are on the fence about Ducey, a choice they dislike could cause them to withdraw their support for the incumbent or stay home on Election Day.

Tufail Ahmad,"Civilised nations prosecute their criminals. But in India, prosecution can be deeply political. Five years since the Muzaffarnagar and Shamli riots in which 62 people were murdered and over 50,000 rendered homeless, no one has been convicted. According to  , over 500 first information reports (FIRs) were filed by police against the alleged culprits; of this, 335 were expunged or closed due to duplication or other errors. Of the 175 cases, forty were decided by courts without any conviction. This is because Indian democracy is run by its new ‘kings’. These new kings are ministers, chief ministers, the prime minister, and the likes of them in power. More than 800 years after Magna Carta established the principle that the king will be under the law, India's new kings act above the country's rule of law. Last December, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, ordered the withdrawal of a case against himself. This is not an argument against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). All parties do the same. Much like the Islamic clerics prevailed over the Indian Parliament to enact the Shah Bano law, early this year some   prevailed over the Yogi government. A   led by the BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjeev Balyan, and MLA Umesh Malik, who are among the accused in the 2013 riots, met the chief minister, and requested that the cases be withdrawn. The Yogi government sought the opinion of the Muzaffarnagar district administration to withdraw 133 cases against the accused, who include, along with Balyan and Malik, two more BJP MLAs Suresh Rana and Sangeet Singh Som, and Sadhvi Prachi of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Most often, cops and officials bend to the wishes of the politicians in power. In India, minor incidents can transform into religious hate and caste conflicts. In Mirchpur village of Haryana, a   at a group of Jat youths, leading to the killing of Dalits. In Faridabad district, the Muslim teenager   due to an altercation over a train seat by a Hindu mob, which deemed him to be a beef-eater and therefore an anti-national, identifying him by his skullcap. In Muzaffarnagar, the riots were triggered after a  . Her brothers murdered him, and were then murdered by a Muslim mob. In wars and riots, women and the weakest communities are the first targets. Neha Dixit, a journalist who covered the Muzaffarnagar riots,   the painful stories of women who were brutalised by mobs. Scores of women were raped and gang-raped, but only seven could muster the courage to file cases. Women were attacked with knives and swords on their breasts. The rapists played the  , celebrating their sexual violence. Recently, a senior IPS officer told me that the three main agencies which enforce the rule of law –   – are under pressures of a different kind: every official in them, to save   (dignity), avoids making decisions. Prosecution also suffers because tax lawyers become judges, unable to deal with criminal cases, while lawyers learn to   courts and judges. Still, Indians trust the higher judiciary. But politicians are termites gnawing at the roots of the democratic institutions in India. Our politics divides our society. Our divisions acquire disturbing proportions during elections, during riots and in government institutions. At all other times, Hindus and Muslims live together.   has published a series of reports on issues involving the 2013 riots. One of them is the story around  , which was established for the riot-victims who are mostly Muslims, but is also enrolling Hindu students, thereby fostering harmony. Their politics will continue to divide us. But India is a new country, with 55 percent of its 1.3 billion souls under the age of 25. This is an age when individuals fall in love. The under-25 Indians can teach love. It's already happening. “I met her at the bus stop and from the moment I saw her I knew she was the one. Slowly, we became friends,” says a youth   of how Muslims and Hindus are falling in love despite the festering wounds from the Muzaffarnagar riots of five years ago. Hate lives in the nature of humans, but most of the time it's love that prevails. As humans, we realise that we commit mistakes. The key question of the failure of rule of law cannot be addressed unless the professionalism of police forces is ensured and political parties are made accountable. As culprits of many riots go unpunished, India looks dysfunctional. Five years on, the Muzaffarnagar riots send a signal that those involved in murder, attempts to murder, arson and hate speech can escape justice because they are in power now. But yes, it can – because we are certain it can't. We tend to think that democracies die in a military coup. “But there is another way to break a democracy. It is less dramatic but equally destructive,” write Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in  , adding: “Democracies may die at the hands not of generals but of elected leaders – presidents or prime ministers who subvert the very process that brought them to power.” Not only in the Muzaffarnagar riots, it is being seen that culprits are hopeful of defeating the judicial system, while victims are resigned to live in hopelessness. This is the threat to India.     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Smriti Parsheera,"Since the release of the Justice BN Srikrishna Committee’s recommendations on data protection, much has been said about the substantive elements of the draft bill. This includes discussions on key issues like consent, data localisation and surveillance. Ultimately, it is the structure of the law and the functioning of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) created under it that will determine the effectiveness of our data rights. The Committee has proposed that the DPA should be a body corporate with four sets of functions: (i) monitoring and enforcement; (ii) policy and standard setting; (iii) research and awareness; and (iv) grievance handling and adjudication Within each of these heads lie a host of activities ranging from registration of significant data operators to laying down codes of practice; from awarding compensation to aggrieved individuals to making recommendations to the government. Will the DPA actually be capable of handling these enormous responsibilities? The answer will depend on the strength of the DPA’s institutional machinery, including its independence and accountability mechanisms. Independence, specifically from the government, is a key feature in the functioning of any regulatory body. This becomes all the more relevant in the present context because unlike many other regulators, that oversee only businesses, the DPA’s authority also extends to the government and its agencies. In fact, given the nature and volume of data handled by the government, many of its agencies would also qualify as significant data fiduciaries, hence attracting enhanced scrutiny by the DPA. The draft bill has suggested some protections in this regard. Notably, it does well in delegating the task of nominating the chairperson and six whole-time members, who will collectively constitute the DPA, to a selection committee headed by the Chief Justice of India. This will reduce the government’s discretion, and therefore scope for arbitrariness and bias, in the appointment process. The bill also restricts the re-appointment of the DPA’s chairperson and members, hence minimising the incentive to take decisions that curry favour with the government. As is the case with most statutory regulators, the bill provides the DPA with the freedom to determine the selection process and remuneration for it employees. This is an essential requirement given the breadth of the DPA’s functions, which will require it to build a competent cadre of employees, including those from the private sector. For instance, both in case of the selection committee’s procedures and meetings of the DPA itself, the bill leaves it up to the government to specify the processes that need to the followed. The draft law should ideally have gone a step further to include some basic requirements like public disclosure of the meeting agendas, views expressed by members and the rationale for any particular decision. By failing to do so, the bill misses an opportunity to ensure a minimum level of transparency in the running of the DPA. It is also curious to find that there is no discussion on having non-executive (or part-time) members as part of the DPA. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) , another expert body headed by Justice Srikrishna, had emphasised the importance of having such members on financial regulators. As per the FSLRC, non-executive members would bring in specialised knowledge and expertise, while also serving as neutral observers who can draw attention to any regulatory mismanagement. The Committee’s report does not offer any explanation as to why this element, which is also seen in laws governing agencies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), was not considered relevant in case of the DPA. If the requirement of having only full-time members was supposed to take the DPA closer to being a “commission”, as opposed to a regulatory body with a governing board, the Committee has not spelt out this distinction. Along with questions of structure and independence, let us also assess the sufficiency of the accountability mechanisms in the bill. In general, one clear path to accountability comes from having an overarching requirement of transparency in the law. This clearly reflects in the relatively more transparent processes of these bodies compared to other Indian regulators. Unfortunately, the data protection bill misses out on this front. The bill lacks an overarching mandate of transparency in the DPA’s functioning and in most situations also fails to spell out such requirements in its specific provisions. There are, however, two notable exceptions to this. First, the draft bill calls upon the DPA to adopt an open and consultative process in formulating any codes of practice for data fiduciaries. Areas like health, finance and telecom, where sector regulators have already begun to focus on data protection issues, are some obvious sites for such regulatory interplay. Interestingly, when it comes to the framing of binding regulations, the bill does not bother to adopt the same standards that it does for non-binding codes of practice. To place this in context, there are about thirty broad areas that are reserved for regulation-making by the DPA. This extensive scope of the DPA’s powers and significant consequences of non-compliance with the law make it all the more important for the DPA to follow greater transparency in its regulation-making. We therefore need statutory requirements compelling the DPA to engage in public consultations, conduct cost-benefit analysis and provide a reasoned explanation while framing its regulations. Finally, there are two other elements for accountability in the draft bill. These relate to (i) the creation of an Appellate Tribunal to hear challenges against the DPA’s orders; and (ii) the reporting requirements cast upon the DPA. Here again, the bill would stand to gain from a more nuanced position in terms of setting out exactly what is expected from the agency. For instance, the bill just provides that the DPA’s annual report should offer a summary of its activities in the previous year. Referring again to FSLRC’s recommendations, this would include items like details of the deliberations held in the agency’s meetings; reasons for non-compliance with any statutory functions; and list of major activities proposed for the subsequent year. In sum, the present draft takes only tepid steps towards building the DPA on strong foundations of sound agency design. Having an authority with tremendous powers, but minimal structural safeguards, would only lead to sub-optimum outcomes for all stakeholders. It is therefore imperative that we recognise these gaps and collectively work towards addressing them in subsequent versions of the bill. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Padmini Vaidyanathan,"The idea of free speech is both a wonderful and a terrible thing. It is the essence of a healthy democracy. Agree, disagree, argue till kingdom come. But how do you disagree, misunderstand, be hurt and still not take it personally and move on? And how often do you struggle to find empathy in the face of the most bigoted hate? Even as Kerala recently battled its worst ever floods in a century, and continues to try and rebuild itself, the amount of hate on social media has left me confused and heartbroken. Whether it is saying that lakhs of people deserved to lose their homes and families because of their eating habits, praying habits, the political party they voted to power, the amount of money they had or where they worked. Or on the other side, defending one’s ego, one’s state  by calling people Fascist, questioning their motives, their allegiance to the government at the Centre, and calling them some more names. North or south, east or west, empathy is hard to find anywhere these days, and differences are easy to spar on. So, I write this, as a Tamilian, who grew up in Delhi, and I simply can’t wrap my head around the misplaced hate, the confusion and the misunderstanding, on both sides. Growing up in the 90s, there was no Internet and there were more reasons to not understand cultures we didn’t know. As a Tamil kid in Delhi, understanding the local culture, speaking fluent Hindi was key to survival in schools and playgrounds. And as with anyone trying to hold on to their roots in a different land, my mother made sure we spoke Tamil at home, went to music classes and the odd  (Carnatic music concerts, for the uninitiated) and even had monthly subscription to Tamil magazines. In the very middle -lass colonies of Sarojini Nagar and Patparganj, there was always a decency of not questioning the differences too much. When the Bhuj earthquake happened, when the Tsunami struck, everyone contributed – to the PM relief fund, in their offices, in schools, in the neighbourhood, whatever they could, wherever they could, without questioning. It was understood that there was nothing to question. When we went to the south for our summer holidays, I would try to impress my cousins and their friends by talking in Hindi and singing Hindi film songs. Impressed they probably were not, but yes, amused by the Delhi   (‘girl’ in Tamil) for sure. My grandfather, who only spoke in English and Tamil, and read   when in Delhi, would insist on speaking in his highly-accented Hindi and ask for  , when travelling in the south. It was a strange phenomenon. Now when you see all the questions and the hate, I can’t help but wonder, were those questions always there – but it just wasn’t polite to ask. You know what they say, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything. And the way things stand, perhaps that’s not such a bad idea. But coming back to  I always thought it did for the politicians. The common person couldn’t care less. Humour is a great way to deal with it. For the millennials at least. I see a lot of “ten things South Indians are sick of hearing” or “ten things not to say to a Punjabi” etc etc. A lot of slightly aggressive regional stand-ups have also been doing the rounds, and depending on where you are from, you may or may not agree with it. But what beyond the quick fix ten pointers and passive aggressive defending of habits? To remember that while it is important to take a stand and one   take a stand, the stand can also be taken sitting down. Perhaps that’s what we need to do. Sit down for a moment and think of the devastation that our friends in Kerala are facing. Just for a moment, don’t blame, don’t point fingers. That’s the job of our politicians and debate anchors. Like Elrond said in the Lord of the Rings “Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.” We are the small hands, we are moving the wheels. So for now, move it in the direction of empathy and love. Donate if you can, pray if you believe, let go of your ego for a bit and remember to question – but nicely.

The Quint,"The opposition Congress demanded on Monday, 3 August, that President’s rule be imposed in Goa in the wake of the absence of chief minister (CM)  , who is currently in the US for a medical treatment. Congress’ Goa spokesman Ramakant Khalap said the state is facing a “constitutional crisis”, and that he has sought an appointment with Governor Mridula Sinha to press for his party’s demand for President’s rule. Speaking to ANI, Ramakant Khalap had said: Parrikar has been “constantly absent” from the state because of health reasons, without handing over his charge to anyone, he said. Also, Goa’s power minister Pandurang Madkaikar and urban development minister Francis D’Souza have been down with ailments, he noted while talking to reporters here. There is no deadline when the CM and these ministers will be back in the state, Khalap said, adding “it is time for Governor Mridula Sinha to intervene in the matter as the state is facing a constitutional crisis”. Parrikar, 62, underwent treatment at a US hospital for a pancreatic ailment between March and June this year. He flew to the US again on 10 August for a follow-up and returned on 22 August, but was admitted to a private hospital in Mumbai the next day. He left for the US again last Thursday on doctors’ advice and is expected to return on 8 September, a senior BJP leader said Friday. D’Souza also went to the US for medical treatment last month while Madkaikar is admitted to a hospital in Mumbai since June after he suffered a brain s5 troke. Khalap alleged that Parrikar and the two other ministers have violated the oath taken by them to discharge their duties towards the state. “If you are sick and not able to pay attention to your duties then it is a violation of the oath…this tantamounts to failure of the constitutional machinery,” he claimed, demanding that the Goa government be dismissed and President’s rule be imposed in the state. Khalap said his party has sought an appointment with Sinha to discuss the “crisis” prevailing in Goa, and listed various issues, like halting of the mining industry, the Mahadayi river water dispute and the alleged failure of law and order to check crimes in the state. “We can understand the chief minister’s temporary absence, but if it is more than 24 hours, then powers are given to someone else,” he claimed. “There is no government existing in Goa,” he said, and asked how many times has the council of ministers met.

Arun Dev,"The results of the Urban Local Body (ULB) elections are out and the Karnataka Congress finally has reason to cheer. When the result of the polls for 105 ULBs were announced on Monday evening, Congress emerged as the single largest party, commanding power in 37 of them. While the Congress won 37 ULBs, the BJP won 31 and the JD(S) secured 12, the Congress-JD(S) coalition won 12 ULBs, and 13 local bodies saw a hung mandate, according to the State Election Commission. The 12 ULBs won by the Congress-JD(S) coalition is the result of a pact between the two parties to join hands for any seat where either of the two parties failed to get majority and the BJP is in the lead. The 105 ULBs include three municipal corporations, 29 city municipal corporations, 53 town municipal corporations and 20 town panchayats. These 105 ULBs are made up of 2,670 wards/seats, with the winners of each ward forming the governing council for the respective ULB. After the polls on 31 August, the Congress managed to win 982 seats, while the BJP secured 929, and the JD(S) won 375 seats. The others, including 329 independents, secured the rest of the seats in the three-way race with Congress and JD(S) fighting against each other, despite being coalition partners, in a strategy to keep the BJP at bay. Experts believe these elections to be an adequate indicator of the current political climate. In 2013, the ULB elections were held before the Assembly polls – the Congress won 1,906 seats, while the BJP and the JD(S) managed only 906 seats each. That year, the Congress swept the Assembly elections. As the 2013 urban local body elections were held months before the Assembly elections, it was seen as a ‘semi-final’ as it reflected the voter sentiment. This year, the polls came after the Assembly elections and the Congress’ victory is seen as a change in the state’s political climate after Assembly polls, where the Congress suffered a crushing defeat. The ULB elections were also seen as a test of the coalition’s stability. Although speculation over cracks in the alliance were doing the rounds, both parties have emerged successful without losing their grassroot-level workers. “The parties forming an alliance before the ULB election was seen as counterproductive, many local leaders would lose their chance to contest because of a division of tickets. That was avoided,” pointed out a Congress leader. At the same time, the objective of the coalition i.e. to keep BJP out of power has been achieved as well. “In areas, where the either of the parties failed to get majority and the BJP was leading, a coalition was formed to keep BJP is out. This is the success story of the alliance’s coordination,” he added. Celebrations were marred in ward 16 of Tumakuru district where an acid-like substance was thrown on those taking part in Congress’ victory procession to mark Inayatullah Khan’s win. At least eight persons were reportedly injured in the rally, which was sabotaged by unidentified persons on Bar Line Road. In a separate incident, a Congress worker, furious over his sister-in-law's loss in the election, allegedly stabbed the mother of the two JD(S) workers in Koppal district. Another incident of alleged stabbing emerged from Mysuru where Congress workers have been accused of attacking a member of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). These elections were considered the first test of popularity of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, which was formed post May Assembly polls when it yielded a hung verdict. The BJP had emerged as the single largest party in the Assembly polls, but failed to shore up the numbers in its bid to form the government. The ULB polls were also considered as indicative of the voters' mood before the next Lok Sabha elections. Compared to its performance in the 2013 urban local bodies elections, BJP has fared far better. In the polls then conducted for 4,976 seats, the Congress had bagged 1,960 seats and BJP and JD(S) 905 seats each. Election for the remaining more than 2,300 seats is likely be held early next year. Polls to Kodagu urban local bodies has been withheld due to the recent floods in the district. Reiterating the JD(S) and Congress' resolve, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda said, ""Wherever we can form a coalition government to keep the BJP out of power, we will certainly do that."" Buoyed by the election results, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said it was a ""befitting answer"" to those who were saying that the coalition government was weak and would collapse soon. ""The election results have silenced all those who have been saying that Congress has weakened, that it was lagging behind and its popularity was diminishing,"" said an upbeat state Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao. State BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa admitted that the election results were not as per the expectations. Yeddyurappa said the results would not have any bearing on the popularity of the government because there were many local factors at work. He reiterated the party's resolve to win 22 or 23 seats out of 28 in Lok Sabha polls. The ULB results show that the Congress, BJP and JD(S) have broadly held on to their position secured in the Assembly polls. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

PTI,"A first-time concerted crackdown has been launched against 'overground' Maoist supporters in various states and about 500 such people have been apprehended by the security forces in Chhattisgarh alone over the last one year, the chief of country's lead anti-Naxal operations force, the CRPF, has said. CRPF Director General R R Bhatnagar told PTI in an interview that this fresh action is being undertaken by them in coordination with state police forces with an aim to deny 'space' to the Left Wing Extremists and to counter them beyond the field operations. ""We are now going to the villages and we are trying to see that action is taken against their (Maoists) overground supporters and workers, 'jan militia' and other people who give them the intelligence and local support. A senior official heading a special combat unit in Chhattisgarh later informed that all those people who have been found to have helped the Naxalite cadres in planning, aiding and executing an attack on security forces are the ones who are on their radar primarily and such persons are being tracked and apprehended or arrested as part of this new strategy to counter the LWE challenge. Bhatnagar, a 1983-batch Indian Police Service officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre, said the paramilitary force is gradually increasing its footprints into the core Naxal areas and has opened at least 15 new camps in the highly impenetrable and inhospitable jungles and terrain of south Bastar in Chhattisgarh which shares borders with Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Telangana. The CRPF boss said he has taken some major policy decisions to orient his combat units for success in operations better and without suffering major reverses. The officer took charge of the force in April 2017 in the backdrop of two major ambushes in Chhattisgarh's Sukma that claimed the lives of 37 CRPF men. The regular battalions of the CRPF are the ones, he said, who go out every day in the same area where the threat is severe. They are actually facing more threats than the special forces who largely go out for focussed operations and hence, it has been decided to make the regular units stronger, the DG said. As a result of undertaking these policy and operational changes, the DG said, this year during three or four severe attempts of ambush by Naxals, the force has been able to successfully ""break"" the killing ring without suffering any casualty and they affected injury to the attacking party. ""That has got the salutary effect for the forces,"" he said. This year, the DG said emphatically, the CRPF operations and the boys are now much more confident, much more stronger and our area domination is better. ""We have tried to deny the Naxals the space to operate by deploying all these measures,"" he said. No doubt, the DG said, the area and the number of districts in the control of the Naxals has reduced and there has been a 40 percent decline in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) violence incidents over a period of the last few years. ""Today, the main movement (of the Naxals) is restricted to certain areas, primarily Chhattisgarh's south Bastar region and also the cut-off area in Odisha which is the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh border and certain parts of Jharkhand,"" the DG said.

PTI,"Breaking his silence over the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal Saturday, 1 September, said he never ordered police firing on protesters at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura that left two people dead. In a statement issued in Chandigarh, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief said use of force was never considered to quell the October 2015 protests after the Bargari desecration incident and there were clear and firm instructions from him that the issue should be resolved through discussion and dialogue. ""It was a period of unbearable pain and stress on my mind. I remained in live contact with the district administration officials and the DGP till well past midnight,"" he said. Referring to Singh's usage of expressions such as 'badmash' (goon), 'buzdil' (coward), ""liar"" and ""unreliable"" on the floor of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, Badal said every sensitive and civilized Punjabi was deeply hurt to see their chief minister ""stooping to such lowly depth"". ""But I expected nothing better than this from a leader whose mind is debased and who is not only a rank opportunist but is also devoid of moral character and given to pursuits of unethical leisure and pleasure,"" Badal alleged. The ruling Congress and the AAP MLAs in Punjab on 28 August, demanded that former CM Badal be booked on ""murder"" charges on the basis of a judicial panel's report on the 2015 sacrilege incidents in the state. The report has held Badal indirectly responsible for the firings at protestors at Kotakpura in Faridkot agitating against the sacrilege incidents, saying he was ""aware"" of the proposed police action to disperse the mob. During a debate in the state assembly on the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report, Congress and AAP MLAs also sought slapping of murder charges against erstwhile Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and the then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, citing the findings of the report. In a nearly eight-hour long debate that ended in late evening, the MLAs also demanded that the ongoing probe into the sacrilege incidents and the police firing at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan be withdrawn from the CBI and handed over to the state police. Initiating the debate on the sacrilege report, tabled in the assembly earlier in August, and the government's action on it, Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill sought exemplary punishment for former Chief Minister Badal, holding him ""guilty"" of the sacrilege incidents as well.

RJD lawmaker and national general secretary Bhola Yadav told PTI that an application has been submitted to the director of the RIMS hospital, where Prasad is admitted, with the plea that he be moved to the 100-bed paying ward, which at present has only three patients. Yadav, who has been beside the RJD supremo for most of the time since he was sent to jail in December 2017, said the lack of hygiene also leads to the menace of mosquitoes which is another potential health risk, ""especially in the rainy season. Besides there is also the problem of excessive noises."" ""The post-mortem house is nearby which attracts a large number of stray dogs. Their barks and howls is a nuisance and cause immense discomfort to the septuagenarian,"" the RJD MLA said. The MLA also said that being a diabetic, Prasad needs to go for regular walks but the location of the cardiology department ward where he is lodged is ""not suitable"" for that. After spending a few months out of the jail, the RJD supremo surrendered before a CBI court in Ranchi on 30 August upon the expiry of the provisional bail granted to him by the Jharkhand High Court for medical treatment.

Neeraj Gupta,"Sandeep Suman Hello friends, If I ask you what is needed to create a WhatsApp group, your answer will be: Just a smartphone and an internet connection. But unfortunately, that's not all. You also need the permission of the DM of the district.  is that the government is extremely concerned about propaganda on WhatsApp. Recently, the DM and SP of Uttar Pradesh’s Lalitpur district have issued an order saying that the admin of every WhatsApp group for journalists will have to be registered with the district’s information department. According to the order: Some believe this move will ensure the noose is tightened around fake journalists, but many believe that this is an attack on one's freedom of speech. On 21 August 2018, in a meeting with WhatsApp CEO Chris Daniels, Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said WhatsApp must be able to track the origin of a forwarded message. However, WhatsApp claimed that it cannot track the origin of a forwarded message because of 'end-to-end encryption'. The big question is, what is it that has suddenly prompted the government to tighten its control over WhatsApp. According to a survey by the Lokniti-CSDS: Which means that ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, WhatsApp might be more effective than rallies and roadshows. As the saying goes, 10 Downing Street, White House or 7 RCR are not names of buildings but names of power centres.

PTI,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has roped in some renowned foreign economists in the newly-constituted economic advisory panel to provide the best possible professional advice to his cash-strapped government on prudent economic policies, media reported on Sunday, 2 September. The immediate challenge for the Khan-led government is to arrange finances to fill about a USD 10 billion gap that is arising due to higher outflows than estimated inflows. Pakistan's current account deficit stands at USD 18 billion, while its foreign currency reserves are just over USD 10 billion, enough to cover two months of imports, according to figures released before the cricketer-turned-politician was sworn-in as prime minister. Unlike past practices, the new 18-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) will be headed by the prime minister himself to ensure that the best possible professional advice is available to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led government to inform, optimise and synergise the formulation and implementation of its economic and financial policies. The first meeting of the council will be convened soon, Dawn newspaper reported. In the past, EACs were headed by finance ministers with no definite agenda for regular meetings. It was observed that EAC met even once in four months and its advice was not considered seriously. Consequently, EACs have become mere debating forums, the report said. According to the terms of reference, the ministry of finance will be the nodal government agency for the EAC, which will function in an entirely non-partisan manner and is expected to strengthen existing state institutions in a collaborative and concerted manner. Out of the EAC's 18 members, seven belong to government and 11 are from the private sector. From the private sector, three leading international academics made EAC members are Atif R Mian of Princeton University (Department of Member Economics) and Woodrow Wilson (School of Public Policy), Asim ljaz Khawaja, Sumitomo-FASID Professor of Member International Finance and Development at the Harvard Kennedy School, and lmran Rasul, Professor of Economics, Department of Member Economics, University College, London.

The Quint,"Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda were booked on Saturday, 1 September, by Haryana Police for alleged irregularities in a Gurgaon land deal. An FIR against Vadra, Hooda and two companies – DLF and Onkareshwar Properties – has been registered at Kherki Daula police station in Gurgaon, Manesar Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Kumar told PTI. Countering the action, the Congress on Sunday said PM Modi had launched a ""vicious and malicious witch-hunt"" by filing the cases against Hooda and Vadra. On the same day, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said, “Our fight against corruption is on. Those found guilty will be punished, probe is underway by different agencies in different cases. This FIR filed by a brave citizen will also be probed.” Hooda has also spoken about the FIR lodged against him. “It’s a politically motivated FIR through a private complaint. People now know this government's intentions. Elections are near and they have found nothing against us. It is just their frustration,” he told ANI. In the FIR lodged on Saturday, the complainant alleged that Vadra's Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd purchased 3.5 acres of land in Gurgaon's Sector 83 from Onkareshwar Properties at a price of Rs 7.50 crore in 2008 – when Hooda was chief minister and also held the portfolio of Town and County Planning Department. He also alleged that 350 acres of land was allotted to DLF at Wazirabad in Gurgaon in violation of rules which made the realty major gain Rs 5,000 crore. Vadra and Hooda have now been booked under Sections 420 (cheating), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the IPC, and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Congress on Sunday said the cases against Vadra and Hooda were to divert attention from the corruption saga of Rafale deal, demonetisation, Rs 12 lakh crore loot through hike in fuel prices, failure to create two crore jobs every year, rapidly falling rupee and failing economy, and complete failure of the BJP government. Earlier in February, Hooda and 33 others were chargesheeted by the CBI in a case of alleged corruption in Manesar land deals worth over Rs 1,500 crore. That chargesheet is related to land transactions in Manesar, Naurangpur and Lakhnoula villages of Gurgaon. The Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government had set up a one-man commission in May 2015 to probe the grant of licences for developing commercial colonies by the Department of Town and Country Planning in Gurgaon's Sector 83. The Justice SN Dhingra Commission, formed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, had examined the licences given by the then Hooda government for the development of housing societies and commercial complexes in four Guragon villages of Sihi, Shikohpur, Kherki Daula and Sikanderpur Bada. The Bharatiya Janata Party had made the land deals a major poll issue in 2014, alleging that Vadra benefited through questionable land use permissions granted by the earlier Congress government in the state led by Hooda.

Amitabh Tiwari,"Congress hopes the trio of Kamalnath, Scindia, Digvijay and the learnings from Gujarat will help it sail through. On the other hand, BJP hopes to romp home on the back of social welfare schemes of Shivraj, development and his popularity among the masses. In Part 1, we analyzed 5 factors which could have a bearing on results of Madhya Pradesh elections, in this part we analyze some other factors. Farmers account for 70% of population and 83% of working population of the state. While it is true that MP records the highest agriculture growth in the country and Shivraj, the  , is credited with the turnaround in agriculture, it’s also noteworthy that more than 10,000 farmers have committed suicide in the state since 2003. The Mandsaur incident last year has not gone down well with the farming community. However, the ruling BJP claims that as the only state that provides zero-percent crop loans MP does not need such waiver. According to the BJP, more than Rs 33,000 crores have been provided to farmers through various schemes in the last one year. The party hopes it will be able to hold onto its support among the farmers through newly announced schemes like Krishi Utpadak Protsahan Yojana (₹ 265/quintal on wheat, ₹ 800 / quintal on Moong) and the MSP hike announced by central government which claims to provide 50% profit over cost of production. Ultimately, it all boils down to the pre-poll mood of the farmer. An upper-caste community body SAPAKS, which has mostly government employees as members, has announced its intent to contest all 230 seats. It hopes to exploit the anger among the forward caste. It remains to be seen how much impact they can make. JAYS, on the other hand, is an organisation which has been fighting for the protection of rights of Dalits and Adivasis. It recently presented a charter of demands to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Earlier it was speculated that they would align with the Congress but they have announced that they will contest 80 seats, mostly reserved, on the symbol of Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP). Shivraj Singh Chouhan has recently launched an ambitious outstanding power bill waiver scheme and subsidised power scheme ‘Sambal’ for labourers and poor families. More than 2 crore people have registered under this scheme, out of the 5-crore-strong voting population. Under the scheme, ₹ 2800 crores of electricity bills have already been waived off. The other recent welfare scheme ‘Mukhya Mantri Jan Kalyan Yojana’ takes care of the needs of poor from birth to death. Pregnant women get ₹ 16,000 worth of benefits pre and post delivery. ₹ 4 lakh compensation to family in case of death of bread earner, fees of students from standard 1 to PhD, and host of other benefits of this scheme are enough to lure voters. Shivraj is banking on this scheme to sail him through. 45% poor and lower-class people voted for the BJP in 2013 elections. The party aims to further consolidate this vote bank through ‘Sambal’. It is widely acknowledged that while the BJP has a sizeable and strong organisation in the state, the Congress is bereft of such cadre presence. Kamalnath is trying to revive the party structure at the block and   levels. Emulating the BJP’s  , the Congress is also creating its army of booth managers. To match the BJP’s IT Cell, the Congress has created a team of 65,000 cyber warriors. An election is all about the D-day management— getting your voter to the booth and slowing the pace of vote in weak booths. The BJP has mastered this art over the last few years and the Congress, too, is gearing up to give it a run for its money this time around. While the BJP’s strategy is to highlight its significant achievements of Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s government, it faces challenge from millennial voters / young voters who have not seen the much-publicized dark era of Digvijay Singh. It is estimated that the state has around 50 lakh voters between 18-25 years. The BJP has started campaigns like   and   comparing state’s condition under Digvijay rule and under Shivraj rule to reinforce its message. It remains to be seen what the impact of this strategy is. As per a recent Dainik Bhaskar survey, 46% respondents are unhappy with their MLAs. This tends to negatively impact the performance of the party which has higher number of members in the assembly as evidenced in Gujarat and Karnataka. The BJP’s strategy elsewhere has been of denying tickets to large number of current MLAs to negate the impact of anti-incumbency. In MP as well, there are reports of 70 - 100 MLAs being denied tickets, including some cabinet ministers. This may lead to rebellion and some of the denied MLAs may end up contesting as independents or on other party symbols. The BJP is likely to announce tickets very late to tackle rebellion. It is noteworthy that many MPs also want to contest the MLA elections. Digvijay Singh is the only Congress leader who has a pan-state appeal. Kamalnath’s influence is limited to Mahakoshal while that of Scindia to Gwalior-Chambal. Digvijay enjoys the pulse of the state organisation and party cadre. He undertook a non-political Narmada  , for 6 months, hoping that he would be made the CM candidate. However, his party has denied him a shot at the CM’s post. His support for Kamalnath clinched the deal in the latter’s favour. Digvijay is a synonym for the dark ages in MP, when there was no electricity, no roads in the state. He is considered as the man responsible for making the state BIMARU. That’s why the Congress chose to sideline him. Shivraj, the astute politician, has realised that it is important to bring Digvijay into the forefront. He attacked Digvijay in late July and called him anti-national for his remarks on Hindu terror. Digvijay retorted and dared Shivraj to arrest him. He led a procession to court arrest in Bhopal. All this has brought the limelight back on Digvijay. The BJP believes that Digvijay could have his own Mani Shankar Aiyyar moment and score a self-goal for the Congress just before the election. To sum up, a complex interplay of a host of factors will determine who ultimately wins Madhya Pradesh. A cracker of an election is in the offing.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Miscreants threw stones at the vehicle carrying Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on 2 September, who is touring the state ahead of Assembly polls, in Churhat area near Sidhi district, a police official said. The incident reportedly took place in Sidhi in the Assembly constituency of Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh, Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesman Rajnish Agrawal said.

Amitabh Tiwari,"A fascinating contest is on in Madhya Pradesh. While the Congress party is aiming to cash in on anti-incumbency and end its 15-year  , the BJP is hoping to consolidate its position further, and make the state its fortress. MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is embarking on a state-wide   covering all constituencies, to seek the blessings of the voters for a fourth consecutive term. No election is won because of a single factor, but rather, due to myriad factors. Likewise, who will win Madhya Pradesh is dependent upon several key factors which I have tried to capture, though this is not an exhaustive list. Caste is king in MP, just like other Hindi-speaking states and many other parts of India. As per a recent CSDS study, 65 percent in MP vote on the basis of caste, which is the highest in the country. The BJP has traditionally received the backing of the upper caste and OBCs, who make up about 55 percent of the population. SC-STs who make up 37 percent, and minorities who account for 8 percent of the population, have traditionally supported the Congress. In 2013, the BJP managed to gain traction among the SC-ST community and garnered higher support than the Congress. In 2018, these caste dynamics could change. The upper-caste of the state is unhappy with the BJP, as power positions have been taken over by OBCs; both the CM and state president belong to this community. Further, the chief minister’s stand that nobody can undo the reservation policy, reservation in promotions and the central government’s amendment in the SC-ST Act, overturning the Supreme Court order has not gone down well with a section of the upper-caste. Even if a section of disgruntled upper-caste voters abstain from voting, it could prove to be troublesome for the party. On the other hand, the trio of Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijaya Singh all belong to the upper caste (22 percent of population). However, the Congress party has not yet come up with a strategy to exploit the anger amongst upper caste, possibly fearing the erosion of its Dalit vote bank if it woos upper castes. Turnout has been a key determinant of results of assembly elections. Normally, a higher turnout denotes anti-incumbency and the desire of voters to overthrow the government. Madhya Pradesh, however, doesn’t follow this trend. BJP came back to power in 2003, with a turnout (67.3 percent) higher than 1998 (60.2 percent). However, in subsequent elections, the turnout has witnessed an increase to 69.8 percent in 2008, and 70.8 percent in 2013. Despite this, the BJP has emerged victorious. The other factor which is increasingly playing a role is NOTA. Higher NOTA benefits the incumbent, as it denotes that the people are unhappy with the current government, but not confident about the Opposition being able to resolve their problems. In 2013 in MP, the NOTA vote share was 1.9 percent, which is quite high, and the BJP returned to power. NOTA polled more votes than the margin of victory in 24 seats. It is an open secret that the state Congress unit is ridden with factionalism. There are not one or two, but seven to eight prominent groups led by Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Suresh Pachauri, Ajai Singh, Arun Yadav, Kantilal Bhuria etc. Most of them have pockets of influence in a specific region, but none of them state wide, except for Digvijay. A Twitter war followed by a poster war broke out between the supporters of Kamal Nath and Scindia, as to who will be CM if the party wins. The state in-charge Deepak Babariya has been heckled in many meetings by supporters of various groups. In a recent   survey, 55 percent opined that factionalism is the biggest challenge for the Congress. 30 percent feel the Congress is not able to provide a viable alternative due to in-fighting. After Kamal Nath’s appointment as PCC Chief, in the initial days, the various factions did put up a united show. Elections in India are increasingly becoming Presidential-style. Chouhan is very popular among the masses in the state. Even the recent ABP-C Voter survey which predicted a Congress victory shows that Shivraj is leading the pack in the most-preferred CM candidate race. Even on a combined basis, Congress leaders are lagging behind Shivraj. Due to Chouhan’s women-oriented schemes like  his popularity among women is higher than men. The Congress needs to be wary of this and re-think its strategy of  declaring a CM candidate. Modi’s popularity in the Hindi heartland is accepted even by the Opposition. Though Rahul Gandhi is closing the gap with Modi, the latter can swing 2-3 percent votes in BJP’s favour in the last 2 weeks before polls, as evidenced in Karnataka. The Congress is trying to form an alliance with Mayawati’s BSP in the state to take on the BJP. The BSP has, on an average, recorded 7 percent vote share in the last 5 elections in the state. The party enjoys 15 percent support among the Dalits in the state. Had the Congress and the BSP contested together in 2013, the contest would have been close, with the grand alliance bagging 102, and BJP 124 seats, down by 41 from their tally of 165. In the past, the BSP has proved its ability to transfer its votes to an alliance partner. However, the challenge lies in whether the Congress voter would vote for the BSP candidate in seats allotted to Mayawati. Till date, there is no clarity on the alliance. Contradictory statements from both sides have added to the confusion. The alliance will make the contest interesting.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Nitin B Balakrishna Ganeshan,"Lakhs of people were gathered at the Kongara Kalan village in the outskirts of Hyderabad, on 2 September, to listen to Telangana Chief Minister and TRS party chief K Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR. And when the chopper arrived at 6 pm, carrying the Chief Minister, there were cheers in the air. KCR took the stage minutes later, but while he was non committal on early elections – a possible announcement that people were keenly watching for – he decided to blow the poll bugle anyway at the ‘Pragathi Nivedana’. The main target of the TRS chief, during his under-an-hour speech, was seemingly the Congress party. “National parties must run to Delhi every time they need to make a decision, unlike us,” he said, and made clear who he was referring to. “Unlike Congress leaders, who have to run to Delhi every time, our leaders are here, in Telangana,” he said. KCR, however, made no mention of the other national party – the BJP – in his speech. This, even as speculation is rife about a possible TRS-BJP alliance ahead of the polls, and even as TRS leaders like KTR and Kavitha have denied any alliance with the party. The chief minister also reiterated that he will make announcements regarding elections ‘at the right time.’ Some reports say that the Cabinet could meet again on 6 September, but another announcement by the TRS chief has raised doubts over whether he, in fact, is planning for early polls. “I will ensure that every household has a water connection before the elections,” KCR promised. “And if a water connection is not there, we will not come to you to ask for votes,” he announced. “No other chief minister would dare to make such an announcement,” he added. The venue of the rally was filled with lakhs of people from different parts of the state, and the party had hired thousands of public transport vehicles to ferry supporters to the rally.

Anthony Rozario,"“In the last four years, India has undergone a change for the disastrous worse,” lamented former Union Minister and Economist Arun Shourie on Saturday, 1 August 2018. Shourie’s scathing attack came in response to a question by veteran journalist Karan Thapar, at an event titled  , organised by  . Remembering his days in the Vajyapee government, Shourie, who represented the Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajya Sabha twice, said even “juniors like him were allowed to differ in meetings.” But the party he was once a member of has, today – stressed Shourie – been reduced to a  (A government of one-and-three-quarter men). Referring to the alleged lack of inner-party democracy, Shourie said that “there’s no BJP today” and that only Shah and Modi take decisions, and the rest run about like “scared rats.” But in this one-and-three-quarters configuration, who’s the person robbed of a complete value?  Jaitley, the present Finance Minister, has in the recent past used Facebook posts to defend the government on issues ranging from demonetisation to the Rafale jet controversy. It is probably his new fascination for Facebook – which allows long posts – that earned the Finance Minister the notorious title of “the minister for blogging”. When asked if India fared any better under the Modi government in comparison to the reign of UPA I and II, Shourie said the real comparison in GDP could only be established if both the NDA and the UPA’s performances were calculated in accordance with the new formula invented by the present dispensation. “I said it from the first day – never believe a new series till the earlier years have been recalculated on the new methodology. For three years, they didn’t do that,” Shourie said. On the government’s claim that the latest GDP numbers are the highest in the world, Shourie said that the numbers pertained to just one quarter. “These finer nuances are something that one cannot expect a lawyer to understand,” he quipped. While the economy has been left to the understanding of “the blogger”, the government and its power – Shourie claimed – lies not entirely in the hands of PM Modi. “From the Enforcement Directorate, to the Central Bureau of Investigation to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office, much of the power today is exercised by BJP President Amit Shah,” he added. He cited conversations with unnamed party insiders in the run-up to the 2014 elections to assert that “every time an idea was suggested to PM Modi, he would ask for it to be run through Shah. Today, it is Shah, who people and the media are scared of.” The present government, he argued, would go to any extent to divide the people to suit their needs. Referring to the recent arrests of activists over allegations of having links to Maoists, Shourie said that he knew Varavara Rao as a gentle man. Asserting that the Gujarat model was now being followed in Delhi, Shourie suggested that during Modi’s days as Gujarat Chief Minister, there were several reports of assassination attempts on the latter. On the Rafale deal front, Shourie claimed that after intense deliberations, the Air Force had suggested the purchase of 126 new fighter jets, out of which 18 would be bought in a ready-to-fly condition, while the rest would be manufactured by HAL in India, through a transfer-of-technology. According to Shourie – “In 2014, the then Defence minister speaking in parliament, had said that 18 fly-away aircrafts were likely to be delivered in three to four years from the contract date. The remaining 108 licensed manufactured aircrafts in India would be delivered in the following seven years.” But this was changed as soon as the government came to power, which decided to buy 36 planes. How did the government reduce the number from 126 to 36? Shourie claimed that such changes to defence procurement can only be made through a fast track procedure, in the event of an emergency. If there’s an emergency, a special defence committee meeting has to be chaired by the Defence Minister, based on proposals sent by the respective services headquarters. “But there is no record of any such meeting,” Shourie claimed. On the present mood of the country, Shourie said that the news of Hindus purportedly fleeing Kairana died out, as soon as the last vote was cast in Uttar Pradesh elections. Similarly, the controversy over the offering of Namaz in parts of Haryana appeared just before the Karnataka elections. “Don’t you see a pattern in all of this?” he asked. “They will try any and every trick to divide people and win an election. And in doing so, they are mostly oblivious to the larger consequence of the instruments they use.” The only solution to such a new normal is an alternative, a change. For this, Shourie stated that the opposition must unite and place a common candidate against the BJP. If proper alliances are forged in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra and if political parties set their egos aside, PM Modi – Shourie said – would find it difficult to return to power. So far as tailoring alliances are concerned, Shourie said that a person not in the race – like Sonia Gandhi or Sharad Pawar – must act as intermediaries between parties. This would be the last change, he warned, to stop this onslaught. “If the opposition fails to check the BJP, it should give up the dream of free and fair election in the years to come,” said Arun Shourie.

PTI,"In the wake of militants targeting the kin of Jammu and Kashmir police personnel, the wife of a policeman from the valley has penned down a moving post about the sacrifices made by the men in uniform in the line of duty. Arifa Tausif, a working woman, has written how most wives of policemen raise their children on their own like a single parent and have no one to support them with their husbands being away on duty. ""We keep planning to attend family functions or funerals together. We keep scheduling an outing. But that hardly ever happens. It's not about solo parenting only. We're the biggest liars!""

She mentions how the wives keep lying to their children assuring them that their father would be home on the coming weekend or the festival. Sleeping alone is not the most stressful, but waking up in the middle of the night, uncomfortable, restless and suffocated is, Tausif said, adding that there is no one around to comfort. Tausif maintained that while all this makes their lives more stressful, the current scenario had turned the wives of policemen hypertensive as they were always in a state of insecurity. ""The risks and dangers are increasing day by day. Every single casualty of a policeman elsewhere makes our life additionally insecure and worrisome. Plus, the varying political ideology of the society makes it hard to explain to the people that doing a job in the police department never means disloyalty to one's people. It's not always a matter of choice,"" she added. Tausif highlighted how the youth in Kashmir have trained to be something else but have ended in police department due to lack of job opportunities.

Joyeeta Bhattacharjee,"The fourth BIMSTEC Summit in Kathmandu on 30 and 31 of August is a positive step towards a Bay of Bengal community, an idea long desired but neglected. The actual realisation of the of the idea of one Bay of Bengal community will be lengthy and require continuous nurturing with an active involvement of the countries of the region, and implementation of the promises made in the summit will be crucial. BIMSTEC, the acronym for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, is an organisation of the countries surrounding the Bay of Bengal. Often the success of a summit is weighed from the number of deals signed during it, and in the present summit, only a Memorandum of Understanding on BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection was signed, giving reason to doubt the jubilation about the summit. A closer view of the summit suggests more than one reason to be optimistic. The theme of the Kathmandu summit was –“towards a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable Bay of Bengal”. It was attended by the top leadership of all the member countries indicating their support to the idea. BIMSTEC has seven member countries including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal, and Bhutan. A substantial portion of the Kathmandu declaration suggested policy reform measures aiming to strengthen the Secretariat, the institution responsible for running the activities of the BIMSTEC. Besides that, the declaration includes issues like agricultural technology exchange, fight against terrorism, gradual reduction of the impact of climate change, increase of trade and investment and ease of visa for people of BIMSTEC member states. The document also stresses on the reduction of poverty and the countries committed to the eradication of poverty by 2030 in line with the sustainable developmental goal. Additionally, the document strongly condemns terrorism in all forms. The Kathmandu declaration also emphasises the importance of connectivity as an important driver for economic integration for shared growth and prosperity, and the prominence of trade and investment for fostering socio-economic development in the region. BIMSTEC was established in 1997 in Bangkok. It envisioned peace and prosperity in the Bay of Bengal region by enhancing economic cooperation amongst countries in the region. Originally, it had four members and named BIST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand Economic Cooperation). With Myanmar joining the group in December 1997, the organisation was renamed BIMST-EC. BIMSTEC attained its present name after Nepal and Bhutan joined the grouping in 2004. The organisation has 15 priority areas for cooperation, including Trade & Investment, Transport & Communication, Energy, Tourism, Technology, Fisheries, Agriculture, Public Health, Poverty Alleviation, Counter-Terrorism & Transnational Crime, Environment & Disaster Management, People-to-People Contact, Cultural Cooperation, Climate Change and Blue Economy. In the two decades of its existence, however, BIMSTEC has seen limited achievements. Member countries have often been accused of not showing the requisite political will to push the growth of the organisation. The gap in the frequency of the summits has often been considered a mark of reluctance of the member nations. The first summit was held in Bangkok, Thailand in 2004, the second in New Delhi, India in 2008 and the third one in Naypyidaw, Myanmar in 2014. The member countries were also accused of not supporting the BIMSTEC Secretariat with adequate financial and manpower resources constraining the performance of the body. After the meeting, the activities of the organisation have grown manifold. Some of the major achievements include meetings of the national security advisors to discuss traditional and non-traditional security issues and joint disaster management exercises. Also, an urge for direction from the top leadership was felt for prioritising the areas of cooperation. The decision on such issues could only be attained at the summit level because it is the highest policy-making body of the organisation. The Bay of Bengal region does not only connect the ecologies of Himalayas with that of the Indian ocean, it is also a major point of the maritime trading route. Being home to one-fifth of the humanity with a combined GDP of $2.8 trillion, the region has the potential to become a hub of economic activities. To leverage the opportunities the region offers, a strong regional cooperation mechanism is necessary. The present summit has shaken up the inertia of the countries, however, to sustain the momentum it will be necessary to conclude the negotiation of all the agreements that are in the pipeline. Also, connectivity projects should be given priority, and agreement on coastal shipping must be concluded at the earliest. Besides, modalities for the establishment of a BIMSTEC development fund proposed during the summit should be given priority. India must take a lead role because the BIMSTEC stands at the centre of its neighbourhood-first and the Act East Policy, its major foreign policy priorities.

Nitin B Balakrishna Ganeshan,"Several lakh people from across Telangana congregated at Kongara Kalan village in the outskirts of Hyderabad on Sunday, 2 September, for a public meeting –‘Pragathi Nivedana' – being organised by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Busloads of people continued to pour in, as 7,300 of the total 12,000 RTC buses in the state were hired by the party to transport people to the venue. Thousands of tractors also reached the venue a day in advance. This is in addition to hundreds of private vehicles that came in carrying people. The party claimed that 25 lakh people will turn up for the meeting, which, they say, will be the biggest mobilisation of people by any political party in the country – mother of all public meetings, as described by the party. Many people from rural areas, predominantly farmers, said that they had come to the meeting with an intent to show their love for the Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for his farmer welfare schemes. Landowning farmers said the government initiatives like Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima helped them. ""We came because the mason insisted. We will lose a day's wage because of this but we have not been offered any money so far. However, we suspect that the mason has been paid because he has been forcing us to come for many days,"" says one daily-wage labourer from Kondapur, as the mason in question forces them to rush ahead in a hurry. While some were assured of payment of Rs 500 or Rs 1,000, others said that they had no choice but to show up. Chief Minister and TRS President K Chandrasekhar Rao will address the public meeting christened 'Pragathi Nivedana' or progress report on Sunday evening. At the meeting, KCR will highlight the achievements of his government in the last four years. The city has been painted pink by the TRS by putting up banners, flags, KCR’s cut-outs, billboards, balloons and festoons on all roads leading towards the venue and at all intersections. As huge traffic jams are likely, those going to the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad have been advised to take alternate routes. In a decision criticised by the opposition parties, Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has decided not to collect toll tax from the vehicles plying on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) on Sunday. The opposition parties have accused TRS of misusing official machinery for the political meeting but Cabinet minister and KCR’s son, KT Rama Rao, has denied the allegations. He said all expenses of travel and food were being borne by the participants while the party was only taking care of logistics. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Indira Basu,"Indian author and public intellectual Gurcharan Das’ latest book  was launched at the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library’s auditorium on Sunday, 2 September. Moderated by journalist Barkha Dutt, the panel comprised historian and writer William Dalrymple, Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor, and art historian and curator Alka Pande. Das, while being disheartened about the condition of our society and its tendency to repress our emotional lives, expressed hope for the future, which according to him, would see more of an embrace of that which is emotional, by the younger generation. Das said at the event, “All of us want to be happy, we want to live flourishing lives, and I have always believed, that the answer to happiness is to love the work you do, and to love the person you live with.” He went on to say, “But the classical Indian sages had another answer. While the Rig Veda spoke of  ,  , and   (emotional well being), 700 years after, the Upanishads spoke of spiritual well being... if  ,   and spiritual well being are in harmony, then you can live a flourishing life.” The author was quick to counter Barkha Dutt’s insinuation that the protagonist of his book  , ie, Amar, was actually the author himself, clarifying, much to the amusement of the audience, that he was certainly not Amar. To which Shashi Tharoor punned, that “Gurcharan is  ”, meaning Gurcharan is immortal. “In the very first scene, the narrator in  , recalls his first memory of desire – it was a cold morning, he runs into his mother’s room, nestles beside her and falls asleep... desire strikes early in one’s life, and this is true of civilisations,” said Das. Tharoor responded to this comment by saying that there has always existed a conflict between those who view desire as evil, and those claim it to be the fount of all creation and existence. Das, taking off from where Tharoor left, said there’s been a grand struggle between those who wrote and subscribed to the , namely, the Kama Optimists, and the Kama Pessimists. Then there was a compromise and another group, the Kama Realists emerged, who said that sexual intercourse was acceptable, as long as it was within marriage. Das is of the view that every civilisation has gone through this compromise. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

PTI,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, 1 September, said that discipline these days is branded ""autocratic"", as he praised Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu for being a ""disciplinarian"" at the latter’s book launch. After launching a book on experiences of Naidu during his first year as vice president of India and chairman of Rajya Sabha, Modi said that Naidu always provided visionary leadership whenever he was given a responsibility.

The 245-page book titled   brings out Naidu's ""mission of engagement"" on four key issues with various stakeholders across the country, and its alignment with the mission of a new India in the making.

Modi said that former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had wanted to give Naidu a ministry in his government, but he said that Naidu had wanted to be the minister of rural development. ""Venkaiah ji is a farmer at heart. He is passionate about the welfare of farmers and agriculture,” Modi said. ""The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana came into being due to the efforts of Naidu Ji.

Indira Basu,"Why doesn’t whistle-blower Edward Snowden want his team of lawyers to protect him? Snowden’s lead attorney, Ben Wizner, tells   reporter:  spoke to Ben Wizner at annual media festival Talk Journalism in Jaipur on 11 August 2018, organised by the Vox Media Foundation. Wizner told this reporter that he constantly struggled against his own instincts to protect Snowden from further harm, as the NSA contractor-turned-whistle-blower has been living in an undisclosed location in Moscow, Russia, under asylum. What’s been Wizner’s biggest challenge in dealing with Snowden? Wizner goes on to say, “So it meant, having to build a team that included criminal lawyers in the US, asylum lawyers in many European countries... just to prepare for whatever contingency might arise.” During our conversation in Jaipur, Wizner says that he often tells Snowden, “You know, for all your engineering skills, democracy isn't a problem that can be solved. There's no technological fix to the challenges that we encounter in free societies. There isn't any formula for fixing democracy. It's always going to be messy.” As would be inevitable in any conversation surrounding Snowden, Ben Wizner and I launch into a discussion on privacy and data protection. The privacy vs surveillance debate is yet to be resolved, and Wizner says to this: So how does one resolve the ‘privacy vs surveillance’ issue when designing smartphones? Wizner adds, “These are competing design models. If you design these systems so that they can be easily surveilled,they will never be secure. So if Apple has to design its products so that the FBI can get in, that means that criminals can get in, hackers can get in, every government in the world would also be able to get in.” India’s draft data protection bill mandates data localisation, which means that a copy of ‘sensitive personal data’ of citizens must be stored in servers within the country itself. What does Ben Wizner have to say about data localisation, with regard to the argument that it will facilitate better law enforcement? After Snowden blew the lid off US government’s surveillance methods, countries like China began insisting on data localisation for better law enforcement. What’s your take on data localisation? You know the truth is, if you look at the last 20 years, rather than the last 2 months, law enforcement hasn’t gone dark, it’s gone bright. Essentially now, for the first time in human history, almost all of our activities and communications can be tracked and stored, and law enforcement has access to almost all of that. Encryption for example, doesn’t protect meta data, and meta data says everything about where we are, who we are communicating with, and our network of friends. So the fact that there are some small portions of communication that, because of encryption, law enforcement can’t intercept and read, HAS to be seen in the context of HOW much information they have because of the digital revolution. As far as India is concerned, Wizner feels, “The more the Internet becomes localised, or as some people say 'balkanised', the easier it will be for countries to use censorship. The worse it will be for free speech and free association. It will really threaten what the Internet has the promise of being, which is, a way for everyone in the world to communicate with each other freely, without the local interference of their governments.” Moving on to the big debate on WhatsApp and rumours being spread via the app, often leading to lynchings in India, here’s what Ben Wizner had to say: So what makes you uncomfortable about WhatsApp’s role in this sort of potential censorship? Under our law in the US, Facebook is not bound by the Constitution. It can decide what kind of platform it wants to be for itself and for WhatsApp. It can make the rules for what conduct is allowed, and what conduct is not allowed. But in the 21st Century, social media platforms have replaced the public square as the place for where most political speech takes place. And so I’ve been very cautious about demands for Facebook and WhatsApp to be more effective censors of this kind of conduct, because I think what’s going to happen is that, even with the best of intentions to prevent hate from spreading and violence from occurring, Facebook and WhatsApp are going to end up censoring a lot of speech that is valuable. Wizner also said, “And I just don’t think I want to be in a world where the decision about what information people see and don’t see is made by multi-billion dollar corporations.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Apoorvanand,"A spectre is haunting India – the spectre of urban Naxalism or Maoism. People are being made to believe that dangerous killers are hiding in the garb of teachers, writers, media persons, lawyers, actors and filmmakers, allegedly conspiring to assassinate the beloved Prime Minister of India, and derail the fast train of development under his stewardship. The present finance minister invented a category of ‘half-Maoists’. A shrill campaign was launched by the minsters and spokespersons of the ruling party with the enthusiastic support of a ‘nationalist’ media labeling all the critics of the present government as Maoists, urban naxals, etc. As if the label of anti-national was not working any more. Or, to make them interchangeable. It must be said that the scare is not of recent origin. It was the learned economist, a man of few words, who, as the Prime Minister in the previous UPA regime had said that Maoism was the greatest internal security threat. It created a ground for the actions of the present regime to target all the human rights defenders. The arrests on 28 August of Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha,   and Varavara Rao; as well as simultaneous raids on the residences of Father Stan Swamy, Susan Abraham, and Anand Teltumbde, follow the 6 June arrests of advocate Surendra Gadling, English professor Shoma Sen, writer Sudhir Dhawale, forest rights activist Mahesh Raut, and prisoners rights activist Rona Wilson in Maharashtra. The Pune police claims that the examination of those detained revealed their links to so-called Maoists, which necessitated the recent raids and arrests. This is an annual event which is held every year by the dalits, who believe that the victory of the British against the Peshvas in a battle two hundred years ago, was actually achieved by the dalits. This year, this event was opposed by several organisations including Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Sabha, who called it ‘anti-national’. Violence broke out, and a person was killed. Dalit groups blamed right-wing bodies, specifically naming two persons, ie, Milend Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide for having conspired and organised this violence. Subsequently, two FIRs were filed against the speakers at the event, blaming them for provocative speeches causing enmity between communities and disrupting peace. It was the second set of FIRs the Maharashtra police are more interested in. Its claim is that the event in itself was a conspiracy of the Maoists, and was funded and supported by them. It is this theory which allowed them to raid and arrest Dhawle, Gadling, Raut, Wilson and Sen in June. The country cannot afford to take lightly this threat, we are told. Forget the absurdity of the ‘letter’ whose content ranges from sources and destination of money, to Kashmiri separatists, stone pelters, human rights lawyers, JNU and TISS students, protests against the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA, the Congress party – and everything else the present regime dubs as ‘dangerous’. Senior journalist Prem Shankar Jha dissected the   in great detail, showing how fake it is. He also says the reason for his belief that the letter is concocted, is the habit of the present regime of floating fake news, videos, etc, to defame its opponents. The Home Minister warned the nation that the student leaders of the JNU were linked to terrorists sitting in Pakistan – an absolute lie. But this lie, convenient for his politics, had made the lives of student activists Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid hell, and they have been criminalised in the eyes of the people who would never believe that their Home Minister could manufacture a lie. Similarly, the Prime Minster himself fabricated the story of a meeting at the house of Mani Shankar Aiyar, in which a ‘conspiracy was hatched’ with the help of Pakistan against the BJP. One has to look at the pattern in the witch hunt was launched against human rights activists. The Prime Minister, way back in 2015 had told the judges that they should not be fooled by the ‘five-star activists’. “There is a need to be cautious against perception-driven verdicts,” said the Prime Minister, adding, “Perceptions are often driven by five-star activists.” This was the pretext used to hound Teesta Setalvad. It is not difficult to understand why it is important for this government to suppress people like Sudha Bharadwaj. They work, mostly through the law, to defend the rights of the poorest of the poor, and the most dispossessed – the tribals and dalits. It is crucial for the government to deprive the tribals of this support. Thus, Chhattisgarh has now been emptied of almost all journalists, activists and lawyers who wrote about the loot of the land and natural resources by big corporations, and defended the tribals. Similarly, Jharkhand is on the target list. That is why it has become necessary to defame and criminalise it, by dubbing it ‘Maoist’ and ‘anti- national’. The present regime has been rattled by the opposition it is facing from the newly- educated dalits. So, the design is to paint the dalit anger as a Maoist fabrication. It has been said that the likes of Rohith Vemula are pseudo-dalits, and are agents of the Maoists. It is said that the mother of Vemula, has been given money by the Maoists to campaign against the present nationalist government. Speakers warned the audience that these ‘urban Naxals’ were hiding in places like JNU and Ramjas College. A popular teacher of the Ramjas College told me that when he was talking to a student, he heard another one, who is affiliated to the student wing of the RSS, shouting “Maoist hai”. Last year, a campaign was launched in Delhi University by the teachers affiliated with the RSS, to ‘free the campus of red terror’. Blacks, human rights workers, actors, film makers, teachers, writers were accused of anti-America activities and of being undercover communists by the then American Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was in office in the early-50s. It led to a four-year-long witch hunt, hounding and persecuting some of the best minds of America. In India, the terror of the present regime, has a similar tone.

Mythreyee Ramesh Shelly Walia,"In his under four-year tenure, Arvind Kejriwal has fought many battles. But it is his persistent fight with the bureaucracy that has increasingly become “exhausting” for his own party members. From his issues with Najeeb Jung – who served as Delhi's Lieutenant Governor during Kejriwal's first year in office – to now Anil Baijal, his tussles have only become more frequent. Though these battles can be seen as inevitable in politics, it’s not just that. As the ripples of his political imbroglio are felt within his party, there are repercussions. On 15 August, the party saw two high-profile resignations. Senior party leaders, Ashutosh and Ashish Khetan, who were representing and defending the party on television, called it quits. While both the leaders cited ""personal reasons"" for their resignations, it has raised questions about Kejriwal's leadership. A close party source told   that his party is not happy with his “dharna politics” – and find it ""exhausting"". In June 2018, for the first time in Delhi's history, the Chief Minister sat on an   against the latter's interference in how he ran his office. The Supreme Court gave the Delhi Chief Minister and his Aam Aadmi Party a big moral boost by ruling that Baijal  , and cannot obstruct the AAP government’s policy decisions. Defending Kejriwal, Delhi government spokesperson Nagendra Sharma says that the fight is now in the Supreme Court. ""The Delhi government's fight with the bureaucracy has nothing to do with the party. So that could not have prompted the resignations,"" he told  . Just days after his resignation, Ashutosh tweeted that during his campaign as an AAP candidate in 2014, party workers introduced him by his caste. His tweets came after reports suggested that Atishi Marlena, the party's likely East Delhi candidate for 2019 Lok Sabha elections, was asked to drop her ""Christian sounding"" surname. Ashutosh's remarks sparked rumours that his resignation stems from ideological differences with the party. In January 2018, the AAP named Sanjay Singh, Sushil Gupta and ND Gupta as its three nominees for the Rajya Sabha elections. The top leadership overlooked senior leaders such as Kumar Vishwas and Ashutosh. However, contrary to reports suggesting Ashutosh was overlooked, a close source confirmed to   that Ashutosh refused the nomination as he was irked with the nomination of businessman Sushil Gupta – an outsider to the party. And there is another related problem. The Delhi Chief Minister is believed to rely on the feedback of a small coterie – including AAP MP Sanjay Singh and Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia – keeping Ashutosh and many others seemingly at arm’s length. The relationship between Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwas has already soured. Though still an AAP member, Vishwas does not attend any party meetings, and is not ""inclined to comment on party issues."" It's all about perception, another source told   on condition of anonymity. In April, in a scathing letter, former AAP leader Mayank Gandhi claimed, “Look around you, almost all of the original volunteers who had left everything to join for the principles have been removed, quit or are inactive."" Among some of the other high-profile resignations are Ajit Jha, Anand Kumar, Medha Patkar and Anjali Damania. Ashish Khetan, a former journalist who has been working with the AAP since 2013 and quit on 15 August, the same day as Ashutosh, said that he no longer wanted to pursue ""active politics."" He tweeted that he wanted to pursue a career in law. Khetan became one of Kejriwal's closest aides when he was appointed the vice-chairperson of the Delhi Dialogue Development Commission, which is an advisory body of the Delhi government. He, however, resigned from the DDC in April, three months after three nominees of the AAP made it to the Rajya Sabha. A former AAP leader, on condition of anonymity, told   that given Kejriwal's inward-looking style, Khetan felt his career wasn't going anywhere. For the upcoming general elections in 2019, the AAP is starting small. In a recent press conference, they admitted to be focussing on about 80 to 100 seats. This is in contrast to the 400 seats the party had contested in 2014. Notably, Kejriwal threw an open challenge and contested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi. In 2014, they managed to win just four seats in Punjab. Punjab, Haryana and AAP's home turf Delhi will be where the party would focus to improve its tally in 2019, AAP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh had said earlier in August. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had won all seven seats in the national capital, defeating Congress and AAP candidates. Besides announcing Atishi as the Lok Sabha candidate, the AAP has announced Raghav Chadha (South Delhi), Pankaj Gupta (Chandni Chowk), Dilip Pandey (Northeast Delhi) and Ghuggan Singh (Northwest Delhi) as Lok Sabha constituency in-charge. These five are likely to be AAP's Lok Sabha candidates. With months to go for the crucial Lok Sabha elections, can Kejriwal and his party succeed without its senior members?

Meghnad Bose," Purnendu Pritam and Vivek Gupta In an emotional video recording on 28 August, Professor K Satyanarayana, son-in-law of arrested activist Varavara Rao is heard saying, “There’s no single charge against me. I have been punished just because I am the son-in-law of Varavara Rao. What is the crime that I have done?” Professor Satyanarayana’s residence in Hyderabad was raided by members of the Pune Police for several hours on the same day that Varavara and fellow activists Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves and Gautam Navlakha were arrested on allegations of being linked to the Bhima Koregaon violence. In Mumbai, 23-year-old Sagar Abraham-Gonsalves had to bid his activist father Vernon goodbye. Thanks to the interim relief provided by the Supreme Court to the arrested activists, Vernon is now back home. But all is far from well. Speaking to  , Sagar explains, “See, the charge still exists. The charge is still on him. There is still a possibility that he can be taken back and put in prison again. That’s when the helplessness turns into rage, because I’ve seen him go through this whole cycle of being put in prison, having numerous false charges put against him.” Sagar recounts the morning of the raid with a feeling of helplessness, “We couldn’t do anything to stop all of this that was happening, to stop this raid, to stop them taking my dad away. All I could do was to tell my dad to be strong. He was trying to joke about the whole thing, telling me that I will have to start writing letters to him again because that’s what I would do back then when he was in jail. He was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to have to start writing letters to each other again’, and all I could do was smile.” On the day of the raids, Satyanarayana, who teaches at the English and Foreign Languages University in Hyderabad, pleaded to the people outside his house, “I am a professor. I teach, I do my duty. There is nothing criminal about it.” In Mumbai, at activist Vernon Gonsalves and Susan Abraham’s home, of all the things that the Pune Police found “suspicious” enough to take back with them, was a book owned by 23-year-old Sagar. Both Sagar’s family and Prof Satyanarayana were repeatedly questioned about why they read “such books”. But how these books can serve as evidence for any wrongdoing, the Pune Police will have to prove in court. And for these families, that’s a battle for another day. Sagar was 12 when his father was arrested in 2007. More than a decade later, he says that the familiar pain has returned. “Last time, he was in prison for around five and a half years. Five and a half years are no small amount of any person’s life. When he was acquitted for all those cases, there was no reparation of any sorts given to him.” Arun Ferreira, one of the activists currently under house arrest, was also arrested in 2007, to be acquitted years later in 11 different cases. But not before he spent close to five long years in jail. Satyanarayana adds, “They have not informed me what charges are against me. They have not informed me in the language that I know, either English or Telugu. The whole exercise of harassment, for more than eight hours, and subjecting to humiliation, is totally illegal.” Yet, despite the difficulties, the families of the arrested activists are clutching on to a sense of optimism and hope. He adds, “We live in a democratic society. And dissent, as the Supreme Court said, is a very very essential part of a democratic society.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Smruti Koppikar,"Five long years after rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar was assassinated in Pune while on his morning walk, and a few days before the first anniversary of journalist Gauri Lankesh’s assassination outside her home in Bengaluru last September, the conspiracy behind these cold-blooded murders may finally be unravelling. The clues and evidence point to individuals who are, or were, directly or indirectly associated with far-right Hindu organisations, according to investigating agencies. But who is / are the mastermind(s) of this conspiracy? Are the 26 writers and intellectuals identified as ‘threats to Hindu society’ safe? The trails in these two assassinations, and similar murders of Leftist leader Govind Pansare and writer-rationalist Dr MM Kalburgi in 2015, are leading to members who were associated with (or still may be) with organisations that claim to espouse Hindu dharma. These organisations have not yet been named in the current round of investigations, but they point to the Sanatan Sanstha and its offshoot ‘Hindu Janajagruti Samiti’ (HJS), ‘Shri Shiv Prathisthan Hindustan’, and ‘Hindu Govansh Raksha Samiti’. Demands have come from various quarters to ban them. Congress leaders in Maharashtra like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil called for a ban on Sanatan Sanstha and for the arrest of its Founder-Chief Dr Jayant Athavale. Activists under the banner of ‘Bharat Bachao Andolan’ including journalist Nikhil Wagle and peace activist Tushar Gandhi, have called for immediate action against the ‘rabid right-wing organisation’. Union Minister and Dalit leader Ramdas Athawale too demanded that Sanatan Sanstha be “completely banned if necessary”. As the ideological and logistical links between the four cold-blooded murders begin to fall into place, demands for outlawing the organisations or proscribing their activities are gathering momentum. Predictably, the push-back has begun. The ‘Sanatan Sanstha’(SS), and other organisations declared “no association” with the men arrested in the assassination and arms haul cases, the earlier references to Dabholkar – where the SS website carried his photograph with a large ‘X’ on it – are not available any more. “The Sanstha is a spiritual, charitable trust,” its spokesperson Chetan Rajhans told a news conference in Mumbai on Monday, 27 August: “There has been a demand to ban us, but for what?... We are being targeted by people for their political aspirations.” He also demanded that the Constitution of India be amended to exclude the word “secular” from the Preamble and that the ‘Sanstha’ would work for a Hindu  . Their saffron-clad and tilak-wearing appearances suggest benign spirituality. But investigations show a different picture. What the agencies – local police in three states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa, their anti-terrorism squads, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – have shown – makes up a veritable web of ideologically-driven young Hindu men, their handlers, affiliate organisations, and mastermind or masterminds at the helm of it all. In addition there’s Vaibhav Raut of the ‘Govansh Raksha Samiti’ from whose house in Nala Sopara in suburban Mumbai, the ATS seized eight crude bombs, ammunition for at least 20 more, and detonators; there’s engineer and stock market player Amol Kale, arrested in Bengaluru and identified by Karnataka SIT as linked to all four assassinations; there’s Dr Virendra Tawde, with past or present affiliations to HJS, accused by the CBI as “key conspirator” in Dabholkar case and by Maharashtra SIT as “main conspirator” in Pansare case; there are others like Sudhanva Gondhalekar, Rajesh Bangera, Amit Degwekar and former Shiv Sena corporator Shrikant Pangarkar who provided logistical and financial support, or conducted arms training. From what’s known so far, they were organised and motivated by Hindutva ideology, they had received training in how to use arms and ammunition, they had been brainwashed into believing that the four rationalist-writers were dangerous to Hindus or the concept of a Hindu nation. The key aspect here is for investigating agencies – some, or all of them – to identify and nab the mastermind(s) and then present a water-tight case in the court. Else, the investigation has limited consequences. This has been said before but it bears repetition. If Dabholkar’s assassins and their mastermind had been nabbed immediately after the heinous act, perhaps Pansare, Kalaburgi and Lankesh would still be with us. But the investigation has been meandering, tardy, and riddled with lapses and contradictions. The CBI chargesheet mentions Dr Tawde as a “key conspirator”, and Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar as the shooters with eye-witnesses to back the claim. The Maharashtra ATS now says Andure and Kalaskar were the shooters. How does this square up? There was similar bungling with the forensics too; the Kalina Forensic Laboratory report to Maharashtra Police and Gujarat Forensic Laboratory report to the CBI state contradictory points about the gun used in the killing. The breakthroughs in Lankesh’s case gave a fresh impetus to Dabholkar’s case in recent weeks and led to the new set of possible killers. Amol Kale has been identified as the head of a covert group and diaries seized during the investigation allowed us a glimpse of the deadly maze, a lethal web, out to finish anyone who the masterminds consider inimical to Hindu dharma. But was Kale working independently? Investigators suspect that Degwekar, then a resident of Ponda (Goa) ashram of the Sanatan Sanstha, was possibly in touch with him but it has not been established. This criminal conspiracy across three states has to be taken apart and established in a legally fool-proof manner to show that the trail leads to the radical organisations for any ban to be justified. This is a political act too. Even after the 2008 and 2009 minor blasts cases in Thane and Goa, “seekers” of the Sanstha were indicted but the organisation escaped all censure, let alone a ban. Dr Athavale was untouched by the long arms of law. The then Congress government in Maharashtra and the Congress-led government at the Centre were not able to push through a ban on the Sanatan Sanstha during 2011-14. If anything, the present BJP state governments in Maharashtra and Goa, and at the Centre, would be ideologically less inclined to create the case for a ban or declare one. The diary seized by investigators in Karnataka reveal that the mastermind or masterminds, through their organisations or independently, had a hit list of at least 26 other influential intellectuals, writers, activists, journalists, police officers and opinion-makers to be eliminated. Some have been threatened too. The sooner that multiple agencies across three states join forces to conclude the investigations, the better. The cases can then be presented in courts and this would hopefully have deterred other trained shooters. In Nala Sopara, thousands came out on the streets within days of his arrest on August 10 in his support, chanting slogans such as “Desh ka neta kaisa ho, Vaibhav Raut jaisa ho”. They were unmindful of the fact that he had bombs and ammunition stored in his house, under his bed, ostensibly while going about his work of gau raksha (cow protection). Similarly, in Satara, there were marches in support of Hindutvawadis who have been arrested in these cases and marchers denouncing the “anti-Hindu” stance of investigators. It shows the extent to which the viral thought “Hindu khatre mein hai” has unfortunately seeped into civil society. A tiny ray of hope came in from Sawantwadi, on the border of Maharashtra and Goa, where the local nagar parishad passed a unanimous resolution condemning radical Hindu organisations for threatening a local intellectual and provided him enhanced security. But till the masterminds of the larger conspiracy are brought to book, the threat to identified individuals – and the society at large – prevails. Those threatening are not merely “small” or “fringe” organisations, but part of a larger dangerous conspiracy. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Ashok K Mehta,"One of the most stunning surprises of the Imran Khan Cabinet was the appointment and swearing in on 20 August of Dr Shireen Mehrunissa Mazari, as the first minister in the Ministry of Human Rights. This ministry is probably the only one in Asia, and is certainly not there in India. This is surprising because all the Indian ‘Pakistan experts’ – of which there are a dime a dozen – had forecast she would become either the defence or the information minister, a portfolio Mazari held in the party. The Mazari name rings a bell in India as she advocated nuclear strikes against India’s population centres in the event of war. Before joining Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), she was the editor of   newspaper for nearly five years, after which she headed the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad. She was prematurely removed at the behest of America, a country she loathes almost as much as her pet peeve, India. I also met Brigadier Abid Rao who, like me, was associated with the Pakistan India People’s Forum for Peace and Democracy, and also a member of HRC Pakistan. Just around that time, the Indian Army had established human rights cells in Corps Headquarters and published papers, especially Army Chief Gen Bipin Joshi’s   whose carriage in the breast pocket of every soldier was mandatory in Jammu and Kashmir and India’s northeast. Mazari was present as I recall, when I promised to send those documents to Rao, as the Pakistan Army had none at the time. Mazari is well-read, and has a degree from the London School of Economics, and a PhD from Columbia University. In a press statement after taking oath, Mazari condemned the decision of the Dutch government for allowing space to its anti-Islamist Dutch Freedom Party to hold a competition on cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. The consequences of cartoons in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and the horrific terrorist attack on the French satirical paper   in 2015, will not be forgotten easily. The election bill 2017 contained what was claimed to be a clerical error in the oath, but the Tehreek Labbaiq Pakistan, which won two seats in Sind and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, created an uproar and blocked the historic Faizabad crossing, linking Islamabad with Rawalpindi. It cost the Law Minister his job, as a Major General got the issue resolved. But as Minister for Human rights, Mazari has to contend with the views of minorities like Ahmediyas, Shias and other Muslim communities who espouse the view that there could be other prophets, and are targeted by sectarian and ultra-religious extremists. There is also a blasphemy law to punish those who believe this. Mumtaz Qadri became a martyr after he killed Governor Salman Taseer in 2011 who opposed this law. The TLP founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi owes his success to Qadri. Mazari has also put her government in a spot by asking it to clarify whether it will follow US or UN on sanctions on Iran. Her book,  is provocative for its criticism of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Mazari’s true talent was manifest in her presentation just before the elections on the 20th anniversary of the Chagai nuclear tests of 1998, at a workshop at ISS. She was scathing in her attack on Pakistan’s feeble diplomacy in not engaging with the 48-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, and putting all its eggs in China’s basket. She feared that if India became a member of the NSG (which is being blocked by Pakistan’s all-weather friend China) it will permanently disadvantage Pakistan’s entry. She commended Pakistan on her first-strike capability in response to India’s Cold Start doctrine, and lauded the second-strike option via sea-launched missile and Cruise missiles. She criticised US for favouring India through a country-specific and not a criteria-based selection process for enabling New Delhi to secure the Civil Nuclear deal in 2005. She said that if Pakistan had not carried out its ‘tit-for-tat’ nuclear tests, India would have been recognised as a nuclear weapons state, (not as is, a state with nuclear weapons), and Islamabad would have been forced to roll back its nuclear weapons programme. Carrying out nuclear tests later would have been impossible, she said. In the run-up to the elections, she was on the Nadia Mirza TV talk show, when she had a brush with JUI F’s Hafiz Hamidullah who lost his cool, and called another woman activist, Marvi Sirmed (who is part of an India-Pakistan Track 2 which I convene), a wh**e. Mazari is all too familiar with controversy. In 2016, the then Defence Minister Khawaja Asif ridiculed Mazari – her appearance and voice – by comparing her with a tractor trolley. She had attacked the Sharif   for allowing the US Diplomat Col Joseph Hall to escape from Pakistan under the guise of diplomatic immunity, after being charged with criminal activity. Last week, TLP supporters ransacked an Ahmediya mosque in Faisalabad, injuring and shooting six people. How will Mazari defend their human rights ?

With this tweet, he also unleashed a fresh attack on the junior Ambani brother. The report, published on 31 August 2018, pointed that Rafale deal talks were underway when Anil Ambani’s Reliance Entertainment entered into a deal to jointly produce a film for the then French President Francois Hollande’s partner and actor Julie Gayet. On 24 January 2016, Reliance Entertainment signed the film production deal with Rouge International, a firm owned by Hollande’s partner Julie Gayet. Two days later, on 26 January 2016, Prime Minister Modi signed the Rafale deal with Hollande. On 23 September 2016, a deal was signed between the defence ministries of the two countries with a clause of 50 percent offset obligations. According to the  , France was to invest 50 percent of the total order cost in local contracts in India. This was reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Just ten days after the deal was signed between the two foreign ministries, on 3 October 2016, Dassault Aviation and Reliance announced a Joint Venture for key player of offset, reported  . Dassault Aviation is the French manufacturer of Rafale jets. On 27 October 2017, the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL)in Nagpur, in the presence of French Defence Minister Florence Parly and Maharashtra PM Devendra Fadnavis. In 10 December 2017, Gayet’s film, produced by Reliance Entertainment hits the screens. Anil Ambani had earlier written to Gandhi on the ongoing Rafale jet deal, stating that his party was “misinformed, misdirected and misled” by “malicious vested interests and corporate rivals” on the issue. The letter was reportedly written earlier in August. The younger Ambani tycoon, who had first written to Gandhi on the issue in December, again wrote saying not a single component worth a single rupee is to be manufactured by his group. He said that all 36 Rafale jets that India was buying would be manufactured from France. Gandhi has been attacking the government for inking the deal at a much higher price than the one the previous UPA regime had negotiated. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Quint,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday, 30 August launched a scathing attack on the Modi government over the Rafale deal, saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “too scared to face the people” over the issue. The Gandhi scion first took to Twitter at 12.12 pm to remind Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of the 24-hour deadline he had given on Wednesday, 29 August to form a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the issue. Hours later at 9.10 pm, he tweeted again to take a jibe at PM Modi saying “I guess your boss refused to hold a Joint Parliamentary Committee on the GREAT RAFALE ROBBERY? Too much to hide, too scared to face the people, I suppose...” On Wednesday, Gandhi had demanded that Arun Jaitley from a Joint Parliamentary Committee to probe the “RAFALE ROBBERY”. On Wednesday, Gandhi launched a two-pronged offensive against Modi in a press conference on demonetisation and Rafale deal, terming them as huge scams which were committed to help his ""crony capitalist friends"". In a no-holds-barred attack on Modi, the Congress chief alleged that the noteban ""scam"" was deliberately inflicted on common people by the PM who owes an answer to the country on why he did so, and demanded a JPC probe into the Rafale issue saying the country wants to know ""what is the deal between the prime minister and businessman Anil Ambani"". He alleged that there was much to hide in the Rafale deal and that is why Modi was not inclined to go for a JPC. On the Rafale issue, Gandhi alleged it is a ""clear cut"" case where Modi is ""lying"" and cited a joint statement made by the PM and French President Francois Hollande in 2015 where it was made clear that the aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the ""same configuration"" as had been tested and approved by the Indian Air Force. ""It is clearly written that the configuration is going to be of the same configuration. So the man is lying,"" he said while attacking the prime minister. Industrialist Anil Ambani has denied the Congress charge that the government had a role in his Reliance group being chosen as an offset supplier and has accused the party of making ""false statements"". He has also written to Rahul Gandhi explaining the deal and slapped defamation notices on Congress leaders asking them not to make ""false"" statements. ""Why did you buy an aircraft of Rs 520 crore at the price of Rs 1,600 crore? Who were you (Modi) trying to benefit?"" Gandhi asked. Gandhi also attacked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, saying while he was blogging he had not said anything on the probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. Referring to his blog, Gandhi said Jaitley has asked some questions, but an option has been given to the prime minister through Jaitley that he is free to ask questions but before the joint parliamentary committee. ""Everything will be clear as to what happened in Rafale,"" he said. ""I have no problems and the Congress party has no objections, we all will agree. The 24-hour deadline is coming to an end and Arun Jaitley is writing long blogs but is not responding to my question. I think Arun Jaitley is caught in a fix, as the permission (for a JPC) is to be given by Narendra Modi. I hope Arun Jaitley has asked from the prime minister, hope he is not afraid of asking the prime minister,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

While speaking to  , Shukla said: He added that while it was done to fight corruption, the illegal currency stashed in people’s home and lockers had returned to the economy. He further said that the money that was not a part of the economy is considered black money that has now returned to the system to strengthen it after demonetisation. However, Prime Minister Modi, in his address to the nation on 8 November, 2016 had clearly stated that the move was aimed at curbing black money.

Nistha Tripathi,"Sifting through the media articles to find genuine information on H1B and its repercussions, has turned out more cumbersome than guiding someone on how to get into Harvard. Ever since Trump was elected, there have been articles that blamed his policies for Indians being forced to exit US. Without citing any legitimate data source, such articles keep propagating half-baked information based on anecdotal evidence, combined with loosely derived insights on a topic that concerns a vast majority of Indian professionals. Mix Trump, H1B and a ‘fear-inducing’ word in your headline, and you have a viral article. But the reasons are not what we normally think and we need to view the issue with a balanced perspective. The damage that is done to the American dream or people flocking to the US in large numbers for higher studies, came more from the uncertainty around how Trump would execute on his promise to win jobs back for the Americans. Employers were not sure of what kind of laws may be passed, and they became more reluctant to hire internationals requiring H1B work visa sponsorships. The wait and watch began in 2017, and the   in the enrollment of graduate students in science and engineering. On close scrutiny, however, no major changes have been made in the H1B programme itself. Here are few of the concrete developments: What has happened is an increase in the number of cases where a worker is stranded in his home country, when going for H1B visa extensions. What used to be a formality earlier has become a complex step in the process. Since these tech jobs from US employers are more likely to go to the Master’s students than the employees of an outsourcing firms, this change casts a bigger gloom on the outsourced IT workers rather than the students graduating from reputed schools in the US. In my venture  , I have been working with young Asian students and professionals who go to the US and other countries for higher studies since the past five years. I did notice a heightened sense of anxiety about US and European schools, and a preference toward Canada instead. At the same time, those who are highly-skilled continue to flourish in the US. We have heard of internships and job offers from Tesla, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and every leading tech company. Hemant Pandey (working at Tesla) adds, “My H1B is approved. I was lucky enough to get it in the first attempt. I know people working at Google who are still waiting after 2 years. With the large companies, which have offices around the world, even if your H1B is not picked, they will transfer you to Vancouver or the Europe office and then file H1B again. I am yet to hear of anybody among my friends and seniors who has to leave the country because of the visa issues. Getting a green card is the real pain.” Having said that, there always have been, and will be people going through questionable consultants and body shops, and ‘low-ranked universities’ who struggle to get jobs.

Raunak Kukde,"NCP has laid claim to half of the Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. Based on their better performance in the previous Lok Sabha elections, Sharad Pawar’s party has presented this formula to their ally, Congress. But the final decision on this will be taken by the 4-member NCP-Congress committee. There are 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. Congress had contested from 26 seats the last time, while ally NCP contested from 22. But Congress only managed to win 2 seats while NCP won 4. Based on this, the NCP is demanding more seats this time. However, because they contested from more seats, Congress’s vote share was two percent higher than NCP’s. In response to the NCP's claim, Congress sources say that because the Congress has always been the bigger party in the state, the NCP's claim is not right. A Congress leader said, “In light of coalition   shuffling one or two seats is possible, but NCP claiming half the seats is a bit much.” For now, a committee has been formed to decide seat-sharing. It has Ashok Gehlot and Ashok Chavan from the Congress side, and Praful Patel and Jayant Patil from the NCP. Apart from the seat sharing disagreement, there is a difference between the two parties on which other allies be given space in the coalition. Congress wants Raju Shetty's ‘Shetakaaree Sangathan’ to be part of it. But at the moment, NCP does not. In 2014, Raju Shetty had contested elections as a BJP ally. But now they have quit the NDA, and Shetty has accused the NDA of betraying farmers. Shetty has designs on Sharad Pawar and NCP’s stronghold. Until now, Shetty’s politics has been against Sharad Pawar’s – Shetty is laying claim to seats which are currently held by NCP, like the Mahda seat, in which senior NCP leader Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil is MP. The last time around, the Shetakaaree Sangathan candidate lost this seat by only 25,000 votes. NCP is clearly unwilling to give up this seat to Shetty. The NCP also holds the Kolhapur seat, and here too Shetty has laid claim. Similarly, there has been no agreement on whether or not to include Prakash Ambedkar's party in the coalition. According to Congress sources, Ambedkar is also demanding 5 to 7 Lok Sabha seats, and Congress is simply not ready to give that many. On the other hand, NCP believes that including Prakash Ambedkar in the coalition will send a message. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint," Anubhav Mishra  Mohd Ibrahim A day after the Reserve Bank of India, in its annual report, announced that over 99 percent of the demonetised currency had made its way back into the banks, Congress President Rahul Gandhi addressed the media on Thursday, 30 August, hitting out at the Narendra Modi government. He further alleged that demonetisation was an attack on the general public, and was intended to help only the rich. “  is nothing less than a huge scam,” Gandhi said. Interestingly, Gandhi began his press conference with a question directed at the media persons gathered – regarding their safety and freedom. “Are you writing freely these days, or is there some pressure?”, he asked. He also attacked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley – over his counter-questions on the Rafale deal. Reiterating his demand for a joint parliamentary committee on the Rafale deal allegations, Gandhi took a jibe at Jaitley’s Facebook post, where the latter had posed questions at the UPA government’s deal on the Rafale jets. Then quoting a joint statement on the deal, allegedly issued by the governments of France and India, Gandhi said PM Modi was “lying”. The Congress president also alleged that the NPAs had grown under the NDA government’s regime to Rs 12.5 lakh, as compared to the previous UPA regime’s Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Lashing out at the prime minister’s electoral promises, Gandhi said: Minutes after Gandhi’s press conference, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley lashed out the Congress President, stating that the Rafale deal was “20 percent cheaper” under the NDA government than the UPA. Taking to Twitter, Jaitley said: Gandhi at the press conference had maintained that the BJP was attempting to buy the Rafale jets at at a price three times more than the UPA government’s deal. To this, Jaitley said: Finally, on Gandhi’s allegation that demonetisation was Modi’s tactic to please his “crony capitalist friends”, Jaitley said: Lashing out Rahul Gandhi, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra questioned if “reform” was “deform” for the Gandhi scion. Taking a jibe at him, Patra said that Gandhi had nothing new to talk about, apart from the Rafale deal. Further questioning how the demonetised money could be called black money, Patra said: The central bank, in its annual report, said almost all of the demonetised currency notes have been counted and accounted for by it. According to the report, Rs 15.31 lakh crore worth currency notes have now been returned, since 8 November 2016. This represents about 99.3 percent of the total currency notes which went out of circulation on a single day. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominated currency notes, the total value of these high value currency notes in circulation was Rs 15.41 lakh crore.

Navdeep Singh,"Some moons ago I had written in  , explaining how the assimilation of women in our defence services was more because of judicial intervention, and less on account of the free will of the establishment. The Prime Minister’s speech on Independence Day 2018, declaring that women would now be eligible for Permanent Commission in the military, comes as a welcome note. But there still are some discordant chords that need to be harmonised. Firstly, women are already serving in many branches as Permanent Commissioned Officers. Secondly, to be fair to the uniformed forces, women officers cannot be suddenly absorbed in all arms wherein men are being commissioned, unless there are suitable changes effectuated regarding terms and conditions of service, which the applicants are clear of. Thirdly, the political executive would have to enforce its will strongly, since past experience shows that many such progressive moves are rendered nugatory by administrative authorities by sending the file into orbit, and by letting loose, unfounded fears which slow down those at the helm. Though there is news in the air that the stand may be altered soon in the Apex Court in line with the PM’s declaration. Women officers whose cases are being heard by the Supreme Court are the ones who were offered Short Service Commission till 14 years of service but were not made eligible for being considered for Permanent Commission. The Delhi High Court had ruled in their favour in 2010, but an appeal was filed by the then government in the Supreme Court. Hence, effectively speaking, the stand of the then government was that women are fit to serve 14 years in the Army as Short Service Commissioned Officers, but unfit to serve 20 years or more as Permanent Commissioned Officers. It may be recalled, that minimum service of 20 years is required for earning pension. As an aside, candidly speaking, it is my belief that in the long run, as compared to Permanent Commission, a tweaked Short Service Commission scheme of 5 to 10 years for both women and men, is ideal for our nation, wherein officers could be released on completing 5 years of service after providing pre-release skills, so that they can settle themselves well in civil professions smoothly. And those released at 10 years can be made amenable to a contributory pension scheme on lines of the New Pension Scheme (NPS) applicable to civil employees, wherein they can at least enjoy some financial protection on being released from the military, in what arguably can be termed ‘middle-age’. A contributory pension scheme on one hand, ensures that the nation is not burdened with a high pension bill, and on the other hand, results in monetary back-up for our women and men in uniform. However, till such policies are firmly brought into place (if at all), officers of both genders need to be provided equal opportunities to be considered for permanent commission. Interestingly, the policies of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for women personnel in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are much more progressive. In various recruitments, there are no separate provisions based on gender and women personnel are also serving in tough field areas, including borders, in the CAPFs. Also, women are serving in all ranks and not just as officers, a process recently initiated for the Army. It is true that the induction of women into various branches of the military, for example in frontline combat, cannot be given effect to without due application of mind, or just as a display of political correctness, however it is also true that these issues can only be tackled by way of brainstorming with an open mind and should not be hostage to hackneyed and contrived thoughts. A committee of experts constituted by the then  , Manohar Parrikar, of which this author was also a member, had observed that appeals must not be filed by the establishment against court verdicts favouring women without seeking sanction of the Minister. The panel had also noted that policy decisions on the subject must be taken by involving all stakeholders including serving and veteran women officers. The recommendations were accepted in principle by the government on 8 August 2016, but till date, no instructions have been issued to practically enforce them. Ergo, to my mind, after the Prime Minister’s announcement, the following must be ensured: Though whispers of the final resolution of this issue have been in circulation for quite some time, let us hope this vexed issue is put to rest once and for all by the establishment. A strong political will is all that is required. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Revati Laul,"At a time when activists who defended the right of dalits and tribals to protest against an oppressive state have been placed under house arrest, and the Supreme Court has had to step in and scold the government and remind us all of the importance of dissent – let me take you to the source of the ‘D word’ – the  . It’s a passage from a fantastic compendium edited by Ashok Vajpeyi called  (published by Speaking Tiger in 2017). And it firmly puts the Sangh Parivar claimants to all things Hindu in their place, when they distort religion, and remove its essential ingredient – dissent. Because in the  , written in verse between 1500 and 1200 BCE, over 3,000 years ago, is the following: Sudha Bharadwaj for instance, gave up her American citizenship and moved to Chhattisgarh to work with tribals in distress, and in need of free legal aid. Gautam Navlakha – an activist with the People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), who has spent decades fighting for people whose constitutionally guaranteed rights have been taken from them. It’s tough to dissent when you know what price you might pay for it. And equally tough to critique people on the same side as you, for not delivering on their promises. The right-wing has one thing absolutely right about us on the left. We often cannot stomach criticism. I include myself here. I can quite easily be a pretender. A voyeur. And have been pulled up for it by friends for describing a rape or mob violence with “too much relish.” So I am using this space of dissent to call out a friend whose politics and work I admire, for his new film, about to be released on Netflix. The film is called   and it’s made by my filmmaker friend Q, or Qaushiq. In his name is his “rejection of all things Bengali”, so the K went out of his name and became Q. The film is a coming-of-age with a lot of explicit sex thrown in, as a celebration of what we normally shy away from. It makes its point by showing the male eponymous protagonist Gandu, erect and masturbating. Then in a fantasy with a woman of his dreams who gives him a full-frontal blow job towards the end of the film. So of course, the film never made it to multiplexes in India, nor was it intended to be. But it made it to film festivals from Berlinale to Slamdance, with critical acclaim for its candour and style. aims even higher. It tells the story of a taxi driver called Phanishwar, whose only salvation is the ultra-right and militant Hindutva outfit called the Sanathan Sanstha. This could be a dark and unsparing look at the connection between perverse sexuality and perverse politics. However, in the very first scene, Q presents Phanishwar’s victim with such relish and erotica, that it takes away from the story. Except she stands posing like a model in a crumpled white sari-cloth from which her perfectly round boobs continually pop out. She has no story. She moans and grunts. She is hearing and speech impaired, so she only gesticulates. Instead, the woman is made to behave like an animal. The tribal deaf and dumb slave animal. She does not walk. She jumps like a frog. She sticks her tongue out. And in one scene, she stares at Phanishwar, inserts her finger into her vagina, draws out some dark menstrual blood, and smears it on her forehead as  . And some around her eye, turning the scene into a sexy photo op – the stuff of male desire, and completely removed from anything tribal I have ever seen. Or read. The plot has more problems, as it unfolds that Phanishwar is in love with a big city girl whose boyfriend has uploaded a sex video of her onto porn sites. By playing the video over and over, and reducing her entire story to one emotion of fear and disgust, by making it a singular story, Q ends up taking the film right back into the troll space where such fantasies are currently played out. Must a woman’s – whose pictures have been tossed into porn sites – whole life revolve ever after only around that one fact? Rape and revenge porn do not become the only defining story of a woman once this has happened to her. To tell this as a singular story, is to take away the dissent from the dissent. To do what many of us including me are often guilty of. Did we describe Nirbhaya’s rape too vividly, so that in the months and years that followed, there is now a sliding scale of horror?  – are some real conversations I have been witness to as a result. Being well-meaning deserves a salute. Q is choosing difficult, in fact impossible stories to tell. But dissent is a demanding tool, and with the right positioning comes an even greater responsibility. Not to feed the trolls but to counter them. The counter can occupy the “You fuck me I’ll fuck you” space, but that only makes the trolls fatter. To thin them out, you have to get outside the hideous and consumptive. You have to give women who have been attacked, stories with all their layers and complexity. You have to see them laugh and have fun. And not embody just the fact of their abuse all the time. Or you will end up doing to them what Joseph Conrad did in his novel  , set in the Congo. And seen from the eyes of a white imperialist, who was both fascinated by and terrified of the natives. But that was 1899. It should not be the space we occupy today. I am using Q’s new film as a lesson to myself. To not flip like a pancake and end up being horrified by the abuse and hate I am surrounded by. But to cut through those extreme manifestations, and try and understand why the hate exists, and what it would take for someone like me to become that person. That is far more disruptive. It’s the kind of work that could perhaps explain why some of the activists that are now under attack, have been targeted in the first place. I’d say, let’s try even one line from the   verse I started with. Can we imagine a space where we say that God came after Creation? I aspire to that. Please pull me up when I fail.  ‘ ’,    (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In a letter to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam said the government should acquire the massive studio which was gutted in a fire and has now been put up for sale by the Kapoor family. ""This will serve the dual purpose of preserving an important part of our nation's cinematic history, culture and heritage while generating revenues for the government,"" Nirupam pointed out. He listed the names of the some of the greatest films of all times which were shot in the RK Studios during its 70-year history and said the government must initiate steps to preserve the tremendous historical and sentimental value attached to it. Located in a shady corner of Chembur, a north-eastern suburb of Mumbai, the studio was founded by 'The Showman' Raj Kapoor in 1948. Ironically, the first film shot there was RK FIlms'  . Seventy years later, a fire consumed the premises on September 16, 2017, spelling doom for the studio. Over the years, some of the most memorable films were made there under the RK Films banner like  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , till Raj Kapoor's death in 1988. Unlike most other studios in Mumbai, the RK Studios managed to preserve all the costumes used in its films shot here during its more than six decades of heydays. After the fire last year, the Kapoor family has cited financial crunch to restore and revive the studio to make it a viable entity and announced its sale recently, signaling the curtains down for RK Studios.

The Quint,"Days after rumours about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) mulling inviting Congress President Rahul Gandhi to an event surfaced, reports on Thursday, 30 August, said senior Congress leaders have advised Gandhi not to accept the invitation. According to ANI, the leaders advised Gandhi to refrain from attending the event, slated to be held in New Delhi in September, in a core group meeting of the Congress on Thursday. The event, “Future of Bharat: An RSS perspective”, a thee-day lecture series is expected to focus on “India’s future”, will be held from 17-19 September in Vigyan Bhawan, and will be addressed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The idea behind the programme is to invite people from different ideologies for the event. Referring to the programme, RSS spokesperson Arun Kumar said: “It is our prerogative to choose whom to invite or not. People from all walks of life, including from different political outfits, ideologies and religions will be invited,” PTI reported. “This lecture series has been organised in this context...sarsanghchalak (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwatji will present the Sangh views on various contemporary issues of national importance,"" Kumar added. Quoting sources,   reported that the event is also likely to witness the participation of other Opposition leaders like Sitaram Yechury, among others. This speculation comes amidst Gandhi’s scathing attack on the RSS at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, where he had linked the Sangh to the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned terrorist organisation. The Bharatiya Janata Party, in retaliation, had   Gandhi’s apology, with the party spokesperson Sambit Patra calling the Opposition leader a “contract killer of the idea called India”. In June, when the RSS had invited former President Pranab Mukherjee, also a senior Congress leader, several people from the party had expressed their displeasure at Mukherjee’s acceptance of the invite. However, soon after Mukherjee’s address, the Congress had hailed him, saying that he was “able to show a mirror to the RSS.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

TS Sudhir,"Seated at a table, with TV cameras before him, MK Alagiri spoke to the media on Thursday in Madurai. It did not take long for his supporters standing behind him to realise that unless they bent down, they wouldn’t show in the frame, only their stomachs would. The manner in which his supporters behaved was a visual representation of Alagiri's politics. Climbing down from his earlier Big Brother attitude, Alagiri is now willing to bend, to have his way. He says he will accept MK Stalin as his leader if he is readmitted into the DMK. The desperation of the man, once celebrated as the Madurai strongman, is showing. Not that he is not holding out the threat of the 5 September rally in Chennai. Next week, Alagiri plans to march to his father M Karunanidhi's final resting place at the Marina beach in a show of strength. The symbolism of Alagiri, the man from Madurai marching into Chennai, designated within the DMK as Stalin's territory, was not lost on anyone. The anti-DMK political players looked at the prospect of the DMK’s first family washing its dirty linen in public with relish. But Alagiri's brag of having one lakh people march behind him is not convincing any more. More so, after the manner in which all the 65 district secretaries of the DMK proposed Stalin's name for the party president's post this week. Alagiri knows if he manages to organise the crowd, the optics will at best give him a temporary lease of life in the Tamil news media. Two weeks is a long time in politics. At that time, standing at Karunanidhi's   Alagiri had spoken about how the “true and loyal followers'” of Karunanidhi are with him. Ahead of Stalin's coronation, it was seen as the big crack in the DMK first family and the narrative started getting constructed about how Alagiri was threatening to break up the party. Stalin let his party do the talking. It was obvious to anyone watching the proceedings at the DMK headquarters in Chennai on Tuesday, that his control over the party was absolute, and there was no way Stalin was going to let Alagiri get a share of the political pie. A parallel story has been playing out in the living room of late Karunanidhi's Gopalapuram residence as well. In the days after Karunanidhi passed away, Alagiri tried to lobby with his family members to seek readmission into the DMK. Sister Selvi who claimed she had been entrusted the responsibility of keeping the family together by Karunanidhi, was the one taking the lead to see that her brothers stayed together. But Stalin made it clear, that a return to the party was non-negotiable. Privately, to his supporters in Madurai, Alagiri has been cribbing about how he should have made renewed efforts to return when his father was in good health. Stalin's position is that he sees no reason to change his father's decision, and sees Alagiri's brand of brash politics a liability in this age of social media, and especially at a time when the DMK is trying to present a more people-friendly image. In 2001, Alagiri was suspended by Karunanidhi for anti-party activities. The son extracted revenge in the assembly election that followed. Alagiri is believed to have played a part in the defeat of DMK candidates in his backyard. Among them, was DMK senior leader PTR Palanivel Rajan, who was Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Assembly between 1996 and 2001. He lost by 708 votes from the Madurai West constituency. Though a lot of water has flown in the Cauvery between 2001 and 2018 and Alagiri is no longer the force he was 17 years ago, no one wants to underestimate his instincts to play a spoilsport. Ideally he should have bided his time instead of behaving like a petulant son within a week of his father's demise. A more crafty politician would have waited for Stalin to falter electorally, to target him. By showing his desperation, Alagiri has revealed he has no aces up his sleeve. Will he be tapped by parties opposed to the DMK? Quite likely, but then, even they would have realised by now that his ability to do mischief is limited. The diehard DMK voter will choose to stick with the party, and the anti-DMK voter in any case has a plethora of options to choose from. Alagiri has been reduced to a soundbite spewing ‘has-been’ politician.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The News Minute,"On 5 September, MK Alagiri is planning a massive rally with an intent to prove that the cadre of DMK still support him. But while the ousted leader has been demanding that he be brought back into the party, on Thursday 30 August, he clarified that he is not looking to lead the DMK. In fact, he said that he is willing to accept his brother MK Stalin’s recently confirmed presidency of the DMK, too. The former South Zone Organising Secretary of the DMK was speaking to media persons after addressing his supporters in Madurai on Thursday. “Didn’t I tell you that day at Kalaignar’s samadhi – the true supporters of Kalaignar are on my side,” he said. “We want to join the party. They don’t want to take us in. We’ll take a decision on what to do next after the rally,” Alagiri said. When one reporter pointed out that MK Stalin was unanimously elected president of the party by the General Council, Alagiri shot back, “The General Council alone is not the DMK. The General Council may select the president or the treasurer. Don’t 1,500 people make up DMK? The cadres are on my side. After 5 September, more people will join us.” Alagiri also denied that his son Dhayanidhi Alagiri had asked for a post within the party. “Hasn’t he himself clarified? Neither his father, nor he have any such wishes,” Alagiri said. Alagiri’s statement at Karunanidhi’s memorial on 13 August raised questions on his possible readmission into the party, even as the decks were cleared for Stalin to take over as president. Alagiri was ousted from the party in 2014 for violating party discipline. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The Quint,"Will be forming a new Samajwadi Secular Morcha for those feeling neglected in the existing Samajwadi Party (SP), Shivpal Yadav, the younger brother of former SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle to current party chief Akhilesh Yadav, announced on Wednesday, 29 August. The morcha, he said, would remain within the party umbrella. With this announcement to form a new faction of the party, the apparent “truce” between uncle and nephew, which was seen earlier this year when Shivpal attended a dinner hosted by Akhilesh ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, has come to an end, reported  . ""I have now formed this front and I invite all those who are feeling suffocated in the SP to come and join hands with me,"" he told the media, IANS reported. He further claimed that he would ensure that work was provided for these people in the morcha. Relations soured between Shivpal and his nephew Akhilesh, after the latter organised a coup of sorts against his father and uncle in the run-up to the UP Assembly elections in 2017. This was after Mulayam had replaced Akhilesh with Shivpal as the state party chief. However, Akhilesh who was the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh over-ruled the Mulayam-Shivpal order in the elections, following which he was expelled from the party by his father, the report adds. In retaliation, Akilesh had expelled Shivpal from all key Cabinet positions. Hence, one would wonder why Shivpal waited till now to form this new faction of the party. Speaking about this, Shivpal said that back then he was hopeful of keeping the SP intact. Around four months ago, Shivpal had met SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav in Delhi where it was agreed that the Akhilesh-led and Mulayam and Shivpal-led factions would reconcile and re-unite ahead of 2019 the Lok Sabha elections, the report added. Following the reconciliation, Shivpal was expected to be given a senior position in the party organisation. “It has been four months, and Shivpal is not even in the party national executive committee headed by his nephew Akhilesh,” an SP leader close to Shivpal told the newspaper. Shivpal met with Suhaildev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) President Om Prakash Rajbhar, an ally of the BJP and a minister in the state government, on Tuesday, 28 August. Rajbhar has reportedly been at odds with the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Shivpal also said that his front would like to assimilate smaller regional forces. Shivpal, who enjoys considerable clout in Mainpuri, Etawah, Etah, Auraiyya, Kannauj and nearby regions, said the secular front would offer a ""political alternative"" in the state. Shivpal’s announcement of the Samajwadi Secular Morcha comes at a time when the SP’s proposed alliance with BSP, put forth by Akhilesh, hopes to offer a challenge to the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. ) (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Anand Teltumbde,"I had just woken up, tired because of the late night arrival of the flight. I saw missed calls from Professor Ajit Parulekar, who is a colleague and director of Goa Institute of Management where I work as Senior Professor and chair, Big Data Analytics. He shocked me by informing that the Pune Police had reached the campus and were looking for me. He said he is rushing to the campus and would let me know of the developments. I had come on an official meeting at 10 am and hence I had to rush for it. By the time I was through with the meeting there was a spate of calls on my phone, which was kept on silent mode. By that time all the TV channels were flashing the news of nationwide raids on the houses of activists and intellectuals, and arrests of some of them. I asked her to hold on and consulted a lawyer friend who advised that the house needs to be checked by one of us for whether the police has planted any object in the house. He also suggested that a compliant needed to be filed at the police station to that effect. As I had some work planned at Mumbai, I asked my wife to cancel my ticket and fly to Goa. She reached Goa and took the help of a lawyer friend and filed the police complaint. Later, when I called the director and asked him how the key of the house was given in our absence, he explained that before he reached the campus, the police had done everything. They met him and handed over the panchnama, a scan of which he mailed me through his secretary. He said that he read it and there appears to be nothing in it. One of my colleagues, Professor Krishna Laddha, a senior professor, who happened to meet the police, narrated whatever he knew. The police had threatened the security guard to get the key and asked him to open the door. Professor Krishna asked them to wait for the director to come before they opened the door. They rudely retorted that the person accompanying them has the authority to issue a search warrant. Professor Krishna informed that the house was opened by a security person. One or two police officials along with a security person and a videographer entered the house and came out within four to five minutes and asked the security person to lock the door. The professor had to attend an important meeting so he left. He did not know whether the house was opened again. I spoke with Professor Vishnu, who stays opposite my house. He narrated similar things but said that the Ecoclean lady saw some plastic box being taken from the house. My wife, after reaching Goa, spoke with the security and got a horrific description of the entire process. They enquired about me and picked up one security person from the main gate for showing the house. At the second gate they repeated the same, taking away all cell phones and disconnecting the phone line, and came over to our house. They threatened the security guard to get the keys. He brought the duplicate keys and the process of opening the house took place as described above. The entire process was conducted as though I was a dreaded terrorist or a criminal. The police could have enquired with me whatever they wanted to, either by sending a police official or calling me to the police station. All my information is in public domain. I have been a meritorious student all through, passing through prestigious institutes of the country, including the hallowed Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad. I did my doctorate in cybernetics and I have worked my entire career in the corporate sector, rising to be the Executive Director of Bharat Petroleum Corporation and subsequently Managing Director and CEO of Petronet India Limited, a holding company in the private sector. Unusually, while living my corporate life, I published over 20 research papers in prestigious journals. After my corporate stint, I was invited to be a professor in another hallowed institute of the country, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur where I taught business management courses for more than five years before coming over to Goa Institute of Management in July 2016 as part of the senior management. I head the institute’s Big Data Analytics programme, and launched a post-graduation course this year, the first of its kind in the country. This professional life has been engaging enough but with the intention to contribute towards creating a just society, I have been making intellectual contributions by way of writing and speaking in the public for more than three decades. I have written 26 books, which were published in India and abroad by prestigious publishing houses such as Zed books, Routledge, and Penguin RandomHouse. Besides, I have written hundreds of articles along with a regular column, ‘Margin Speak’ in the prestigious  . All my writings get regularly translated and published in most Indian languages and even abroad. Most of these articles are available on the internet and in the public domain. I have delivered hundreds of lectures across India and abroad. I was twice invited by US universities for lecture tours. I have been doing this role of a public intellectual for all these years, winning me several laurels, awards and honorary doctorates from universities. I have thus a reputation as one of the outstanding scholars in my own field of management; as a professional, I have a reputation as a CEO-level corporate executive, as a writer, I have a reputation of being one of the most sought after authors; as a public intellectual, I have a reputation of being one of the most sought after persons in the entire country. I have been an activist since my student days, as a student leader, and later as civil rights activist. In the course of time, I became associated with many organisations, none of which advocate violence or do unlawful things. For instance, I am General Secretary, Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, Executive Member, Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisations, and Presidium Member, All India Forum For Rights To Education. I am definitely critical of the present regime but unlike many others, fault the entire post-colonial construction of the State for its rise. As for insinuation of my connection with Bhima-Koregaon or Elgar Parishad, I happened to write a critique of the Bhima Koregaon episode published in  incurring the wrath of many Dalits all over the country. As regards to the Maoist tag, I had written books (for instance ,  , published by Left Word, and even   published by Navayana), criticising their practice and reliance on violence. I, like many other people who have been targeted, was not even in the conference. With what stretch of imagination could I have even been suspected to have connection with these things? The entire episode is based on a letter the police produced, the authenticity of which is far from established. Many people have already expressed serious doubt about its veracity. And on this basis, the police are targeting summarily all intellectuals in the country. They are misusing draconian laws like the UAPA to terrorise people into silence by targeting select intellectuals and activists. I urge the judiciary to take note of the monumental harassment and torture innocent persons like me are pushed to endure without any iota of wrongdoing on our part. I also urge the people of my country to judge for themselves from the foregoing whether I deserve the treatment that I have been made to meet.  was taken into custody  (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Bharat Karnad,"The strikingly silly hoo-ha on Indian television over the non-event of the quip-a-second cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu – a rank made-for-television entertainer and Punjab government minister, embracing the Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the swearing-in ceremony of a fellow cricketer, Imran Khan, as Prime Minister – only reveals how easily something so trivial can be transformed into jingoistic excess. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a letter to his incoming Pakistani counterpart, has welcomed Khan’s assuming power as an opportunity to reset bilateral ties. What exactly is so offensive or untoward about this? Surely, it is nobody’s case that ramping up bilateral growth and economic and investment interlinks won’t improve the chances of peace, and ensure it becomes the new normal in South Asia. In fact, it was the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad Ajay Bisaria who in May this year talked of potential annual trade of $30 billion if only the Pakistan government eased up on its regime of restrictions. A good part of this trade would involve the formalisation of the indirect ‘switch trade’ that presently takes place with Indian consumer goods of all kinds – marked for export to Dubai on merchant ship manifests, offloaded with the same ships anchoring outside the immediate Karachi waters. The annual loss of revenue to the Pakistan exchequer from this informal channel is in billions of dollars. It is money the Tehreek-e-Insaf party government can use to fulfil its election promises in the social welfare sector. After all, Pakistan’s hard currency reserves dwindling to less than $9 billion cannot but worry Imran Khan to conniptions. It is a promising opening that the Bharatiya Janata Party government, if it has any strategic sense, should jump at widening by: That said, it is also clear that General Headquarters in Rawalpindi is no more likely to terminate its terrorism leverage it can utilise to keep the Indian armed forces and government distracted, than India giving up on supporting Baluch freedom fighters to keep the Pakistan army committed and unsettled – as revealed by Prime Minister Modi in his 2016 Independence Day address from the Red Fort. This won’t happen any time soon, however. In any case, which country does what first before the dialogue caravan begins rolling becomes moot once both capitals seriously assess what’s at stake. They are able to play off the South Asian states against each other, egging on one and then the other, to serve their distinct national interests. For instance, the US has been vocal about its anti-terrorism stance but Washington has time and again made plain—and this has not been paid attention to by Delhi—that their concern is mainly with Pakistan assisting the Afghan Taliban factions fighting the NATO forces in that country, and not with Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Masood Azhar, or Hafiz Saeed. Consider China: The so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is increasingly recognised by Pakistanis as a debt trap that would permit the Chinese to put down roots and redo the ‘East India Company’ scene from some 300 years ago. What may transpire in the years to come cannot be anything but disastrous for Pakistan. What is certain, however, is that the Belt and Road Initiative, of which CPEC is part, will load Pakistan with debt amounting to over $90 billion on the original $46 billion credit funding by Chinese banks. While Imran Khan has no choice other than to assure Beijing about his government’s commitment to CPEC, he can’t be unmindful of how Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port and related infrastructure project has panned out. In lieu of Colombo’s inability to service the debt,  . Other Asian states are awakening to the danger that easily available Chinese credit portends. The prospect of unpayable debt and subsequent Chinese takeover  , for instance, to limit its risk and financial exposure by reducing the Chinese stake in its Kyakpau seaport multi-nodal project from $7.6 billion to $1.3 billion, and   worth $22 billion. Wouldn’t a desperate Pakistan, if offered half a chance, grasp eagerly at an alternative? The vast and cascading benefits of open trade with India are: This is the scale of energy that both India and Pakistan desperately require to fuel their economic progress. The supreme tragedy is that the strategically handicapped and permanently shortsighted Indian governments, particularly in the new century, have sacrificed the greater strategic good for the trivial satisfaction of discomfiting Pakistan and in the process pushing the latter more seriously into the China orbit. Apparently, the Indian government is quite sanguine about Pakistan emerging, in the decades ahead, as a full-fledged Chinese colony and a Chinese People’s Liberation Army military base, and does not care to do anything positive to head off this eventuality. The irony couldn’t be missed: Just as the Siddhu-Bajwa hug was unnecessarily creating heat and fogging up the Indo-Pak picture, prime minister Modi was meeting with General Wei Fenghe, Chinese defence minister and former commander of the PLA Rocket Force, and saying soothing things, like “Maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas is indicative of the sensitivity and maturity with which India and China handle their differences, not allowing them to become disputes” and referring to Sino-Indian relations as “a factor of stability in the world”. He went on to praise the “increased momentum” of high-level contacts, including in the defence sphere. What must Wei make of this except that Modi, like previous PMs, is a sap? And this when, in reality, China is the gravest security challenge that India faces but, ostrich-like with its head buried in the sand, it refuses to even acknowledge. It is seemingly convinced, in the manner Nehru was   Mao’s China, that to act adversarially towards China is to make an enemy of it. It is a line, incidentally, that Mandarin-speaking Indian diplomats continue to profess, and which Modi, to his great demerit, has bought into. On the world stage, China consistently trips India up diplomatically and undermines Indian interests, and because Delhi has put a premium on it, prevents the possibility of this country becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Further, it exploits India’s open market to exacerbate India’s balance of payments problem in excess of $70 billion annually owing to unbalanced trade. And China has initiated a ‘hybrid war’ with India (using persistent cyber attacks), bulked up its military capabilities on the 4,000 kilometre-long Line of Actual Control and formed the secret ‘Fourth Fleet’ specifically to counter this country's control of the Indian Ocean with permanent bases in Djibouti and Gwadar. And still, the Indian government agrees to military exchanges and joint war exercises with the PLA and is committed to interminable talks concerning the undelineated border! Why not restart a dialogue on an open-ended basis with Islamabad to: Meanwhile, Indian and Pakistani troops on the LoC can continue gunning it out if they must, and ISI and RAW can keep at their covert operations. Modi , Ajit Doval , keep your eyes on the strategic ball – worry about the China threat bearing down on this country. But first, stop jumping on to the table every time the Pakistani mouse squeaks.

Rawat, while responding to a query on alleged participation of government officers in chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra, said that even the slightest partisan behavior would be stringently dealt with,    . The coming Assembly elections in four states will also witness a disabled-friendly set-up at polling stations and use of a mobile application to report electoral malpractises. Rawat said 'accessibility observers' would help differently-abled voters during elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. The Election Commission has laid a special emphasis on making the poll process accessible for all sections, especially the persons with disabilities, those who are aged or infirm, he said. At least one polling station managed only by women will be set up in all 230 constituencies in the state,    . The CEC also said that a Citizen Vigilance App will be operationalised to ensure free and fair elections. Through the app, anybody can report a violation of model code of conduct or a corrupt electoral practice by a candidate by uploading a video clip of the act, he explained. Complaints received through the app will be attended promptly, Rawat added. ""We have directed the concerned officers to look into it seriously,"" Rawat added.

Akanksha Kumar," Ashutosh Bhardwaj When 24-year-old MBA graduate Alisha Thomas enrolled for a fashion designing course at a  (skill training centre) run by the state government, she didn’t know what was in store. Her enthusiasm for adding another certification to her CV soon turned into disappointment when she realised that she had been enrolled for a four-month course in tailoring. A training centre in Dehradun had listed ‘fashion designing’ as one of the many courses available under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), which is what she thought she was getting. Alisha said she had attended just two classes, each running from 9am to 5pm, but stopped attending any more because they resembled “ghar panchayats” more than classes. The teachers would talk about mundane domestic affairs rather than offering any technical knowledge or instruction. Moreover, there were no materials provided to students with which to practice or learn. A few months after leaving off these classes, Alisha got a call from the centre with a trainer requesting her to sit for the exam. Alisha told them she wouldn’t be able to, as she hadn’t attended regularly. In July 2018,   had visited a training centre in north Delhi’s Kirari where we had found that despite completing a four-month course in retail, students were not able to find jobs. It was this   that led to Alisha sharing her experience about a Kaushal Kendra in Dehradun.  has sent a questionnaire to the National Skill Development Centre (NSDC) asking whether there are checks and balances in place to ensure that only those with regular attendance are allowed to sit for the exam.

Four policemen were killed on Wednesday, 29 August, in a terrorist attack in the Shopian district of Jammu and Kashmir, police told PTI. The incident took place at Bonagam in Shopian, a police officer said. While two policemen died on the spot, two others succumbed to injuries in hospital. In a separate incident on the same day, two Hizbul Mujahideen militants, including the outfit’s commander Altaf Ahmed Dar, alias Altaf Kachroo, were killed in South Kashmir's Anantnag district, police said. Most schools across Kerala reopened on Wednesday after a 10-day Onam break, which coincided with the worst floods to ravage the state in a century, turning many schools into refugee centres. Hundreds of school students, many of whom were languishing in relief camps until just the other day, returned to their classes for an emotional reunion with fellow students and teachers – and in some cases, to damaged school buildings. Since 9 August, Kerala witnessed unprecedented floods that left 1.4 million in over 3,000 relief camps, most of which were schools. The Kochi Airport, which had been closed since 15 August, also resumed operations on 29 August.

The Quint,"Writer and activist Varavara Rao was arrested from his home in Hyderabad on Tuesday, 28 August, for his   in the Bhima-Koregaon violence in Maharashtra last year and for being a part of an alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Rao’s name had cropped up in a letter seized by the police in June during searches on those arrested in connection with the Elgar Parishad event on 31 December 2017, to commemorate 200 years of the Bhima-Koregaon battle of 1818. In the left intellectual circles, Varavara Rao is a big name and is known for taking strong stances against neo-liberalisation of the state. A prolific poet, he has over 15 poetry collections to his name and is also a founding member of the   or Revolutionary Writers’ Association, popularly known as  The association was later banned by the Andhra Pradesh government. Born in 1940 in the then Andhra’s Warangal district, Rao’s tryst with revolutionary “Maoist” ideas began when he was serving as a lecturer in the Mahabubnagar district. In 1968, when he left that job to go back to Warangal and join a college there, Rao founded a group called  (Friends of Literature), which started producing a journal called   in 1966. While   later went on to allegedly propagate Maoist ideology, initially, it was only devoted to modern literature. Warangal was one of the first places to respond to the Naxalbari movement, which began in Bengal in around 1967. In 1969, with Rao as one of the driving forces, Warangal saw the rise of a literary group called   (Rebel Poets), which associated itself with the armed struggle going on in Andhra’s Srikakulam district then. was formed as a culmination of the Srikakulam struggle and Rao has been a part of its executive committee since its inception. As a part of  , he toured Andhra Pradesh extensively, while continuing his literary endeavours. Rao has published 15 poetry collections of his own, besides having edited a number of anthologies. His poetry has been translated into almost all Indian languages. His thesis on ' ' published in 1983 is considered to be one of the finest works of Marxist criticism in Telugu. A volume of his editorials was also published in  . During his prison days he translated Kenyan writer, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's prison diary   and novel   into Telugu. He also wrote his own prison diary   (1990), which was translated into English as  . Varavara Rao is no stranger to political imprisonments. He was first arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) in 1973, and then again during the Emergency. He was also amongst the 46 accused of overthrowing the Andhra government in the Secunderabad conspiracy case and was imprisoned once again in 1985. After that he was also accused of attended a meeting where the plan to kill Andhra Pradesh Police constable Sambaiah and inspector Yadagiri Reddy was hatched. He was acquitted of all charges after 17 years in 2003. In 2005, Rao went as an emissary for the People's War Group in peace negotiations between the Andhra Pradesh government and the Naxalites. After multiple rounds of talks failed,   was banned. However, the ban was lifter three months later. Even after this, he was arrested once again in 2005 and released in 2006.

Nishtha Gautam,"Rajdeep Sardesai, veteran journalist, has been propped as PM Modi’s biggest nemesis. His coverage of the 2002 Gujarat riots, the cash-for-votes controversy, and a ‘soft’ Sonia Gandhi interview has given enough ammunition to the supporters of PM Modi and the BJP to brand him as a Modi-hater. His new book  , a collection of his columns written over a period of almost five years, explores his relationship with the ruling party and the Prime Minister. In this candid interview with  , Sardesai responds to the oft-repeated allegations of being biased. What do you have to say about media’s current credibility crisis and your own role in it? I’m afraid that we face a serious credibility crisis. I have no doubt in my mind that we have, to some extent, compromised on the integrity of our profession. When I say we, I’m not excluding myself here. Journalists have made serious compromises with their profession. Some less than others. Beat reporters just follow the story. I think what has happened is that as you go up the ladder in this profession, you become cautious. As I said, cockroach becomes the butterfly. You end up making certain compromises, sadly. I’d like to believe I’ve made much less than most. But then, that’s my view. I leave that to others to judge. What about cash for votes? ‘Cash for votes’ which took place in 2008 during the nuclear trust vote, we carried the sting operation. We didn’t carry it when the BJP, which in a sense was a co-participant in the sting wanted us to. We carried it in public domain. But there were legal checks we had to do. As a result we could not carry it within....nobody carries a sting within one hour of it being done.  There was a trust vote to be won or lost so the BJP wanted us to put the tapes in public domain instantly. But we took legal advice and we were told that we could not do so. We carried the story when we had to. And in hindsight, you could argue, maybe I shouldn’t have listened to lawyers. But I’ve learnt over the years to listen to lawyers. What do you have to say about the phrase ‘Lutyens’ Media’? Are you a part of it? I’m not a Lutyen’s reporter, since this term is used in a pejorative sense. I moved to Delhi in 1994, I’m a Mumbaikar. I grew up in Colaba, I’m a Colaba kid. You could call me if you want a South Mumbai cosmopolitan, no problem. But you cannot call me Lutyens. I observe Lutyen’s Delhi as an outsider. I’m not an insider in that sense. I’m a Mumbaikar in exile in Delhi. The right to dissent does not make me anti-national. The right to dissent does not make me a presstitute. Similarly, today if I were to applaud a government scheme. That doesn’t make me godi media or paid media. Why should journalists be either activists or why should they be embedded? They should just be journalists. Are you really anti-Modi? UPA 2 got the worst press in the history of independent India and justifiably so, I believe. Particularly in the later years. The government just lost the plot. Contrast that with Mr Modi. I don’t think anyone has had the kind of soft landing that this government has had. Look at demonetisation! Where’s the serious interrogation of what were the benefits and losses of demonetisation? We’ve given him a very soft landing, and this to a prime minister who has taken no press conferences, who’s taken no question. I do believe that it is important for a journalist to show the mirror to the politicians to be able to say like it is. That’s what I’ve tried to do. And, I think, if that leaves me vulnerable to the charge of being anti or pro Modi. It’s unfortunate but I’m willing to live with it now. I have no problems with it, my conscience is clean. And we have to be anti-establishment at one level. How can you afford to be anti-establishment when journalism is now synonymous to access? That’s a very good question. I think, unfortunately, access journalism has come to matter more and more with the result that being anti-establishment is more and more difficult. How do I get an interview with an individual if that individual has decided ‘I will only give access to those who praise me. I will not grant access to those who are excessively critical of me’?  Unfortunately, the relationship between the politicians and the media has changed and this cuts across all parties, all individuals. We keep singling out Mr Modi but how different is he from Mamata Banerjee or late Jayalalithaa or Naveen Patnaik or Nitish Kumar or, indeed, the Gandhi family? All of whom live in this access journalism bubble and sadly, many of my fellow colleagues see huge benefits in simply lining up and saying ‘ji huzoor!’ How will you justify your last Sonia Gandhi interview where you went very easy on questions? I’ve been very open and transparent about it. I was asked the night before as I was flying into Lucknow to drive to Allahabad that the questions I had sent, I had to change them.  That I should only ask questions on Indira Gandhi. At that stage I had two options: say ‘forget the interview, I won’t do it’ or say “okay,  I’ll go to do the interview and slip in all the questions I can.” Unfortunately, every time, if you see the interview, every time I tried to slip a question, she’d say ‘Not now, I will not answer political questions.’ I had no choice once I was doing the interview but to ask questions on Indira Gandhi, which is very different from going to do a political interview, let’s say, of Mr Modi and then asking him questions which are soft. I mean, give me half a chance of doing a political interview with Sonia Gandhi and I promise you I will ask all the questions that I want to ask.  On hindsight, you could argue, I could have said, “Sorry, please find someone else! I’ll not do the interview.” But that’s where competition comes in. Do you want to give another channel access to do an interview with Sonia Gandhi? You don’t. She speaks so rarely that we are ready to take every morsel. See, this is where access journalism comes in! Because we are denied access to Sonia Gandhi, when I get the interview then even though she said she would not take political questions, I say okay so be it. I’ll do it. Have you also been soft on Laloo Yadav? Did you not exoticise him? No, I’ve resisted that temptation over the years to exoticise. I show Laloo for his strengths and his weaknesses. He sparked off a remarkable political revolution in Bihar but he also was responsible for a certain complete corruption of institutions, a caste-ridden polity in that same state. Not that caste didn’t exist before Laloo in Bihar, but I think Laloo allowed a certain corruption of the system as well as the rise of the family raj in Bihar. I showed both. Is that exoticization of Laoo? Not really?  You could argue that a journalist sometimes likes to see the underdog win. And when I first met Laloo, he was the underdog. And I guess that’s when he was very attractive to me. Later on, he became the top-dog. When someone becomes the top dog he’s less attractive. For me Bal Thackeray is just as interesting as would be a Jyoti Basu. Left and Right. But I’ve had a beer with with Bal Thackeray and I’ve had beer with Jyoti Basu. Are you too involved in elections? I am an obsessive election junkie. My two great passions are cricket and elections. I love elections. And I take it seriously. I take psephology seriously. The best thing on a counting day is to watch someone who says ‘I’m gonna win with a huge majority’ actually lose. From 89, when I did my first election to now 2019 will be 30 years. That was the election of VP singh. We’ll see who is the winner. Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar What do you predict for 2019? The Congress is a bit like a family firm. The Modi-Shah juggernaut are a new India enterprise. They are hungry. The chemistry is with Mr Modi. I think the strategic local level alliances are with the Opposition. But I would say at this stage, I think it’s still advantage Mr Modi. The key is Uttar Pradesh. To my mind India’s most populous state will decide whether Mr Modi will be India’s next Prime Minister or not. If Mr Modi, like he showed in 2017, is able to work his chemistry against the arithmetic of alliances. Then I still believe Mr Modi will be India’s next Prime Minister.

"Indira Jaising, The Leaflet","Lawyer Surendra Gadling successfully defending his clients under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) was arrested and thrown behind bars on 6 June of this year. Now, lawyer Susan Abraham defending Gadling in Pune saw her house in Mumbai be raided and her husband Vernon Gonsalves arrested. Vernon has earlier faced prosecution under UAPA and was acquitted after spending over five years in prison. Today, he has been arrested again. Sudha Bharadwaj, a prominent trade unionist and academic, has been arrested and will be taken to Pune, as per latest reports. Her 20-year-old daughter has had her Facebook accounts locked and her electronic devices confiscated. Other activists whose homes were raided include Stan Swamy in Ranchi, Arun Ferreira in Mumbai, Gautam Navlakha in Delhi, Anand Teltumbade in Goa, and Varavara Rao, her daughter Ananla and son-in-law Kamalnath in Hyderabad. Some of them have also been arrested as I write these painful words. Susan, Shoma (Sen) and Sudha are all mothers bringing up their children – sons and daughters – peacefully. They are all professional working women, law-abiding citizens who uphold our constitutional morality to the last letter. Today, they are either behind bars, or are witnessing their homes invaded by the State. Is that why they are being branded “Urban Naxals”, “Half Maoists” — by members of the ruling party, including eminent ministers, as well as by sections of the TV, digital and social media? Are these arrests the draconian fallout of those words, those narratives played over and over again during prime time on national television? On 14 August, I was invited to the launch of a book published by Oxford University Press, edited by Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and a compilation of the writings of his late father Dr L M Singhvi.

There was no challenge to him. On the contrary, people clapped and exclaimed how charming he was. Now I feel his words were ominous. Is the government trying hard to prove that there is an actual role to justify the initial arrests? What have we come to? Are we a country which arrests its lawyers first to prevent them from defending their clients? Every human being has a right to a legal defence. We are going through times when lawyers who are on the front lines taking up unpopular causes are being maligned, attacked, arrested and held in prolonged detention, and/or killed.
