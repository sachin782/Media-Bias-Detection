Press Trust of India,"Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday ordered suspension of Delhi's food and supplies commissioner over alleged irregularities in the ration system detected during an inspection by Food Minister Imran Hussain, while the Opposition called it a ""stunt"" to cover up failures. The order, sent to Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, to suspend Food Commissioner Mohanjeet Singh came after Hussain submitted a report stating that ration from a shop in west Delhi's Nangloi was found ""missing"" despite a receipt of delivery. ""This is very serious. Food of the poorest people is being stolen. Responsibility ought to be fixed at the highest levels. I have directed the suspension of the food commissioner,"" Kejriwal tweeted. Speaking to the media about the inspection done on Tuesday evening, Hussain said he ""found that the ration which was to be distributed to 4,000 people from 1 December onwards was missing. In all, 152 quintals of wheat and 38 quintals of rice was delivered from the godown but when we force-opened the ration shop, it was empty."" Hinting at the role of ration mafia in the incident, Hussain said that people living near the ration shop also did not see any truck delivering ration at the shop, ""which means that the ration was taken elsewhere"". ""This is a huge scam. Even after my incessant orders to the food commissioner to inspect these shops, no action was taken. It is not the minister's responsibility to inspect... the commissioner should do it,"" Hussain said. The MLA from Ballimaran constituency said to stop such incidents, his department has been asking the lieutenant-governor and other officials to start doorstep delivery of ration ""but no official accepts the proposal"". ""We cleared the proposal to start doorstep delivery of ration twice in the cabinet, but no action was taken. I have personally written to the chief secretary and the lieutenant-governor several times but they don't pay attention. ""Now, the chief minister has ordered the suspension of food commissioner and if the lieutenant-governor doesn't take action even now, then it will be clear that he is also involved in the entire incident,"" Hussain asserted. On the other hand, calling the suspension of food commissioner a ""stunt"", Delhi's Leader of Opposition and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Vijender Gupta alleged that the step was taken by Kejriwal to cover up his failures. ""The Delhi government has disastrously failed to provide ration at a fair price to the poor and needy in the four years of its misrule. It is now trying to cover up its failure. It has failed to bring in a viable system for distribution of ration. The only thing it has done is to bring in alluring schemes which could never be implemented. It has now stooped to diversionary tactics such as suspension of the top official,"" Gupta told the media in New Delhi. He also said the government is ""dumping the responsibility for mismanagement"". The Leader of Opposition said: ""It is surprising that during the two-day session (of the Delhi Assembly), the government did not mention anything about lapses in the ration system. It kept on indulging in politics. Now it has suddenly woken up and taken action to blame the top official. It is trying to mislead and misguide the public."" When   reached out to Mohanjeet Singh to ask if he was given a chance to present his side, he said: ""There is no suspension."" ""If electronic point of sale (EPOS) had been installed, it would have ensured that no ration is diverted from the shops. ""For the last six months, we have been recommending restoration of EPOS to the food and supply minister but to no avail. When installed earlier, EPOS was able to stop pilferage worth crores. Why the system was suspended is for reasons best known to the minister,"" Singh said.",2018-11-29,"AAP,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,Delhi,Imran Hussain,Mohanjeet Singh,NewsTracker",Arvind Kejriwal orders suspension of Delhi food commissioner; BJP calls it 'stunt' to cover up govt failures,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-orders-suspension-of-delhi-food-commissioner-bjp-calls-it-stunt-to-cover-up-govt-failures-5643121.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Slamming the revision of GDP data under the UPA as a ""bad joke"", the Congress on Thursday alleged that the NITI Aayog has done disservice to the nation with its ""hatchet job"" at the behest of the Narendra Modi government and demanded that the body be disbanded. The Opposition party also hit out at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for defending the exercise, which it termed as a ""brazen assault on the very sanctity of Indian statistics"". ""NITI Aayog's revised GDP numbers are a joke. They are a bad joke. Actually they are worse than a bad joke. The numbers are the result of a hatchet job. Now that NITI Aayog has done the hatchet job, it is time to wind up the utterly worthless body,"" Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said. Senior party leader and former Union minister Anand Sharma also lashed out at the planning body saying, ""by fudging the GDP data to massage the ego of Modi and hide the miserable performance and mismanagement of the Indian economy, the Ministry of Statistics and NITI Aayog have done a disservice to the nation."" He said the integrity of Indian data has become suspect internationally and in one blow the credibility of Indian statistical institutions and experts who prepared the earlier GDP data has been severely damaged. ""Pathetic to see the Finance Minister defending the brazen assault on the very sanctity of Indian statistics"" Sharma said. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said ""the venerable Central Statistics Organisation (CSO) has now been converted into a NAMO (Numbers Adjustment and Manipulation Organisation)"", adding ""Mahalanobis must be fuming"" He was referring to PC Mahalanobis, revered as the father of Indian statistical research. Chidambaram said that the earlier numbers were calculated by the National Statistical Commission and asked whether the Commission has been disbanded. Agreeing to former Chief Statistician Pranab Sen, he said NITI Aayog has nothing to do with tabulation of data. ""I wonder if NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar will agree to a debate on the data than telling journalists that their questions are 'undeserving of an answer',"" said Chidambaram. Former minister Kapil Sibal tweeted: Jaitley on Thursday defended the revision in India's GDP growth rate during the previous UPA era, saying it was done by a ""highly credible"" organisation, the Central Statistics Office, which maintains an arm's length distance from the finance ministry. He said the revised numbers, based on a new formula with 2011-12 as the base year, are globally more comparable as they take into account a far greater representation of the Indian economy and are more reflective of its real state. Taking on opposition Congress for criticising the revision, he said the Congress had welcomed the upwards revision in growth numbers of the last two years of the UPA regime by the same CSO and had gone to the extent of saying that the ""the new GDP series has conclusively established that we did not mismanage the economy"". Later in a blog post, Jaitley said the revised economic growth data has taken away Congress party's last surviving argument ""my GDP growth was higher than yours"". The new numbers show India's economic growth rate averaged 6.7 per cent during the Congress-led UPA regime as compared to 7.3 per cent under the present government. Previous numbers had put the average growth rate during the 10-year UPA rule at 7.75 percent.",2018-11-29,"Anand Sharma,Arun Jaitley,BJP,Congress,GDP,Narendra Modi,NDA,Niti Aayog,P.

Press Trust of India," The HD Kumarawamy-led JD(S)-Congress ministry in Karnataka would be expanded before the Winter Session of the state legislature commencing on 10 December, state Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao said Thursday. Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, he said the Congress and the JD(S) would decide on their respective nominees to the six-month-old cabinet, whose expansion was expected in November itself. ""I had said that cabinet expansion will be done before the Assembly session (begins). Session begins on 10th (December), before that cabinet expansion will take place. We will do it,"" Rao said. His statement came amid speculation that the expansion was likely to be delayed further. Recent comments by Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and former chief minister Siddaramaiah that they were waiting for appointment to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is busy with elections in five states, to discuss about the expansion had triggered the speculation. There is growing clamour from legislators, especially of Congress, for the expansion at the earliest. According to the pact reached between the two partners at the time of formation of the coalition government in May, there are now six vacant ministerial positions left for the Congress and two for the JD(S). This will be the second expansion of Kumaraswamy's ministry, who currently heads the 26-member cabinet. Meanwhile, several Congress leaders from Hassan district, reportedly upset over the style of functioning of Kumaraswamy's brother and district in-charge Minister HD Revanna, on Thursday met senior leaders including KPCC chief Rao and Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru, requesting them to ""save"" the party in the district. ""We have been fighting against JD(S) and Revanna over years, we remained silent (on joining hands) obeying high command's orders... now we are being targeted. Their intention is to suppress Congress for their survival in Hassan,"" Congress leader Putte Gowda told reporters. According to sources, the leaders have petitioned the Congress leadership against Revanna. However, Rao said, they hadcome to explain about the party and political situation in thedistrict and not to complain against any one. ""They had come with issues relating to party workers and seeking more representation for them in any government related nominations,"" he added. Revanna, on his part, said, ""Let Siddaramaiah or Parameshwara speak to me if there are such issues. I don't practice hate politics.... there is no such thing."" Hassan, the home town of HD Deve Gowda and his sons Kumaraswamy and Revanna, is a JD(S) strong hold and Congress had been fighting the party bitterly over the years. Both parties joined hands to form government in the state after the 12 May Assembly polls threw up a hung verdict.",2018-11-29,"Congress,Dinesh Gundu Rao,G Parameshwara,HD Kumaraswamy,HD Revanna,JD(S),Karnataka,NewsTracker,Rahul Gandhi","Karnataka cabinet will be expanded before 10 December, says state Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/karnataka-cabinet-will-be-expanded-before-10-december-says-state-congress-chief-dinesh-gundu-rao-5643431.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday demanded quota for Muslims, hours after the Maharashtra legislature passed a bill proposing 16 percent reservation in education and government jobs for Marathas. The AIMIM said Muslims, too, deserve benefits of the reservation system as they have ""lived for generations in poverty."" In a tweet, the Lok Sabha from Hyderabad said depriving backward Muslims of their fair share in public employment and education was a grave injustice. ""I have consistently argued that there are backward castes in Muslims who have lived for generations in a cycle of poverty. Reservation is a tool that will break this cycle,"" he stated. AIMIM legislator from Maharashtra Imtiaz Jaleel questioned the BJP-led government's ""indifferent"" attitude towards the minority community. ""The state government has shown an indifferent attitude towards the Muslims by completely ignoring their valid demands for 5 percent reservation in education which 
was endorsed even by the High Court,"" Jaleel said. He said the ""hurriedly"" passed Bill for reservation to Marathas mentions the backwardness of the community on the basis of findings by a government-appointed commission. ""Going by the same logic, the plight of Muslims who have been regarded as socially, educationally and economically backward by three commissions - the Sachhar Commission, the Ranganath Mishra Commission and the Mehmood Rehman commission - should also have been given the same benefits as those being given to Marathas,"" he said. ""But irrespective of which party is in power nobody cares for the welfare and upliftment of minorities,"" Jaleel claimed. He said the previous Congress-NCP government ""cheated"" the community by not giving them reservations while in power for 15 years and now the BJP-Shiv Sena administration is ignoring the community's legitimate demands which is ""highly condemnable"".",2018-11-29,"AIMIM,All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen,Asaduddin Owaisi,BJP,BJP-Shiv Sena,Hyderabad,Imtiaz Jaleel,Maratha Community,Maratha Reservation Bill,Mehmood Rehman Commission,Muslim Community,NewsTracker,Ranganath Mishra Commission,Sachhar Commission","After Maharashtra Assembly passes quota bill, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi demands reservation for Muslims",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/after-maharashtra-assembly-passes-quota-bill-aimim-chief-asaduddin-owaisi-demands-reservation-for-muslims-5643411.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Thursday coined a new ""gotra"" for Congress president Rahul Gandhi, mocking his Italian lineage through his mother and party leader Sonia Gandhi. Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party chief Mahendra Nath Pandey called it ""gotra Itlus”. This is the latest remark in the row over Gandhi's gotra. A priest at Pushkar lake in Rajasthan recently said Gandhi gave out his gotra during a ritual as ""Dattatreya"", who are Kashmiri Brahmins. Some BJP leaders challenged the ""claim"", reminding that Gandhi's paternal grandfather was a Parsi, not a Hindu with a ""gotra"". Pandey told reporters in Gorakhpur that Gandhi has ""no gotra"", going by the traditional male lineage. ""And if we take his gotra going by his mother, it should be gotra Itlus,"" he said. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had said Tuesday that the 'gotra' mentioned by Gandhi while offering prayers at Pushkar was that of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and not of the Congress president. ""Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi, Maneka Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi have come and offered prayers at the ghat and it is recorded with us,"" Pushkar priest Dinanath Kaul had said. The priest claimed he possessed old records showing this. Mahendra Nath Pandey also said the BJP supported the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, which will built through ""any means"". ""The case is in court and we hope that the decision will be in our favour. However, the temple will be constructed by any means,"" the BJP leader said, referring to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute the Supreme Court is hearing. But he added that the BJP had never contested elections on the Ram temple issue and the party's agenda was always development. He also defended Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for an alleged remark in which he called Lord Hanuman a Dalit. Pandey said the statement should be seen in a wider context. ""The chief minister expressed his views about Hanuman, the one who was behind uniting all in the Ramayana. But people who worry about 'gotra' started finding caste and 'gotra' in this too,"" he said.",2018-11-29,"Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Congress,Gorakhpur,Mahendra Nath Pandey,NewsTracker,Pushkar,Rahul Gandhi,Rahul Gandhi Gotra,Rajasthan,Ram Temple Agitation,Ram Temple Dispute,Sonia Gandhi,Uttar Pradesh,Vasundhara Raje,Yogi Adityanath","Uttar Pradesh BJP chief takes jibe at Rahul Gandhi's 'Italian' lineage, says he belongs to 'gotra Itlus'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/uttar-pradesh-bjp-chief-takes-jibe-at-rahul-gandhis-italian-lineage-says-he-belongs-to-gotra-itlus-5643511.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service," Calling Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao ""Khao Commission Rao"", Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lambasted him for enriching his family at the cost of Telangana, and promised all-round development if the Congress-led Peoples Front won the Assembly elections. Addressing successive rallies, Gandhi simultaneously targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and KCR for crony capitalism and denying rights and protection to tribals and farmers. He asserted the Congress-led coalition will first dethrone the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the state and then the Modi regime in Delhi. ""KCR's only job has been to rename old Congress projects only by enhancing their costs, and getting commission for himself and his family. KCR stands for Khao Commission Rao,"" said Gandhi addressing a rally in Nizamabad. Pointing at how ""KCR supported and endorsed all moves"" of Modi and the BJP-RSS, including demonetisation, Gandhi said the TRS party should rename itself to ""T-RSS"" to reflect ""its bond with the RSS"". ""KCR's only aim is to ensure his family rules in Telangana and Modi rules in Delhi. But time is up for both,"" asserted Gandhi. Addressing another rally in Bhupalpally of Jayashankar Bhupalpally district, Gandhi said: ""Modi at the Centre and KCR in the state diluted laws meant to protect tribal lands. The result is tribal land is being snatched away for industrialists without proper compensation. Despite having so much land and forest, tribals here have no protection and their rights are consistently being trampled upon."" Accusing KCR of plunging Telangana into debts, Gandhi said: ""When he became the chief minister, Telangana was at a surplus of Rs 17,000 crore but today it is reeling under debts of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore."" ""On one hand KCR is burdening every family with debts, on the other hand his son's income has grown by over 400 percent,"" said Gandhi, referring to KT Rama Rao's annual income that has increased from Rs 29 lakh in 2014 to around Rs 74 lakh in 2018. Claiming that over 4,500 farmers committed suicide during the KCR regime, Gandhi pledged to cancel farm loans to the tune of Rs 2 lakh each and also promising minimum support price (MSP) for 17 crops, including Rs 2,000 for paddy, Rs 7,000 for cotton and Rs 10,000 for chillies. He also promised setting up of 30-bed hospitals in every subdivision and giving Rs 5 lakh to eligible families to build houses. He assured the setting up of a tribal university in the state and preventing the privatisation of the Singareni coal mines. Besides doubling old-age pension to Rs 2,000, he also promised providing Rs 3,000 as unemployment allowance and jobs to one lakh youth. Ridiculing KCR for not fulfilling the promise of building 22 lakh houses, Gandhi said it was time for the TRS chief to take rest in his ""Rs 300 crore"" house and let the Congress-led coalition work for the state. Besides the Congress and Telegu Desam Party (TDP), the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) are constituents of the People's Front.

FP Politics,"The first signs of an anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) grand alliance emerging from North India has all the bearings of the initial idea of a Third Front. According to latest reports, the political parties in Uttar Pradesh are busy drafting the stencils of what could be a  (a grand alliance without Congress). After dumping the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have apparently worked out a formula to align non-BJP, non-Congress caste based parties in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. quoting sources from the parties, reported that Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati have been holding talks over the last few days. The duo have readied a basic framework for a larger alliance. Included in the scheme of things is the Rashtriya Lok Dal, led by Chaudhary Ajit Singh, the son of former prime minister and farmers' leader Charan Singh. The report further stated that the parties are waiting for the result of the Assembly elections in five states, before they hold a formal meeting and go public with the finer details of the arrangement. Sources told  that the seat sharing formula being deliberated upon seems to be slightly skewed in favour of BSP. The party, which has a strong support base amid the Dalit voters, will get somewhere around 30 to 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha. RLD, which has considerable reach among farmers and Jats in Western Uttar Pradesh, may get three to four seats. The alliance will also set aside a few seats in reserve, in case it is able to lure Om Prakash Rajbhar's Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, which is currently a very bitter BJP ally in Uttar Pradesh. Feelers have also been sent out to the Krishna Patel faction of Apna Dal, a party whose other faction is led by Union Minister Anupriya Patel. The Samajwadi Party will contest on the remaining number of seats, while the alliance is expected to not contest from Raebareli and Amethi, seats traditionally contested by Congress president Rahul Gandhi and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. That being said, working out the finer details may be easier said than done as the constituencies in Uttar Pradesh are usually a complex mix of caste and class equations. Ajit Singh's party, once a force to reckon with amid sugarcane farmers of Western Uttar Pradesh many of whom were from the Jat community, has only just started reorganising its strength. The likely areas, where it wields influence, are currently held by Samajwadi Party, which holds appeal amid a larger cross-section of castes. Similarly, the presence of Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party in a BSP-dominated alliance may also complicate things, as Rajbhar and Mayawati may not see eye on the fundamental issue of reservation. While Mayawati's core support base constitutes of Dalits, the primary beneficiaries of the reservation policy, Rajbhar   for his community. Rajbhar also supports  reservation on economical backwardness than only social backwardness. The eastern UP on average has   and in some assembly segments like Sehar and Selampur in Ballia district, their share in population is as high as they are as many as 35 percent and as per 2011 census,   21.1 percent of Uttar Pradesh population. Meanwhile, the Congress which initially floated the idea with much enthusiasm by collaborating with Akhilesh in last state Assembly election, seems to have missed out on the chance to be part of the grand alliance in the most politically-important state. It is Congress that has been reiterating the need to bring the smaller and regional parties together to defeat the 'greater evil', and yet buoyed by the possibility of winning in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls it failed to honour the demands of these smaller parties, which could have served its greater interest in Lok Sabha. A win in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, can be a game-changer in national elections for any party, as it accounts for 80 out of 545 parliamentary seats. After the Congress failed to reach an understanding with both Samajwadi Party and BSP, Akhilesh had strongly criticised the grand old party for its arrogance and incapability of being able to take along the non-BJP forces. Akhilesh   for going solo saying, ""It was good they did not choose us or the BSP, as now we have the chance to highlight their mistakes."" “Congress is responsible for BJP ruling the country,” he added claiming that had it been an alliance among Congress, SP, BSP and Gondwana Gantantra Party, the coalition could have mustered 200 plus seats in Madhya Pradesh. After the alliance discussions with the BSP collapsed in Madhya Pradesh, Congress leader Kamal Nath claimed that it was not a setback for his party. And yet, if the talks of such a grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh solidifies, it is Congress' loss in all plausible caste equations. Narayan Dutt Tiwari, popularly known as ND Tiwari, was the last Congress chief minister in Uttar Pradesh. Since the 90s, the grand old party has been increasingly relegated to the margins by the rise of regional satraps like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati. The party, which contested 105 seats in the Assembly polls, could win only seven, and in last Lok Sabha polls, the party was restricted to an abysmal two seats. To add to this, Congress' major support base of Hindu upper caste is long lost to the BJP, and nothing seems to indicate that things may have changed on ground, at least in Uttar Pradesh. Dalits, who abandoned Mayawati and got divided between BJP and Congress, are much more likely to go back to the BSP than vote for Congress. Similarly, Muslims who have been voting for Congress in other states, will find an attractive alternative in the Samajwadi Party. However, Congress leader   that leaving Congress out of the grand alliance will eventually benefit BJP. Khurshid, who has been Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Chief twice, asserted that parties should not write off the Congress in the state and it was important that it is part of an alliance with the SP and the BSP to take on the BJP in the 2019 polls. Asked about talk of Congress being given very few seats in Uttar Pradesh or excluded from the grand alliance, Khurshid said, ""I would think it will be very myopic. I am not saying it because we stand to gain from the opposite view, but I think excluding the Congress or making Congress look (like a) dwarf in UP will be myopic."" He said the BJP would also benefit if such a scenario pans out. Khurshid said that The SP and BSP can certainly go up to 24, 25 or to 26 percent vote share, but it doesn't mean that the Congress is ""nothing"". He said that it should be kept in mind that the Congress had done well in the state in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. ""And we did that, while we still were considerably behind them (the SP and BSP) in vote share because the big cities voted for us in a major way. Today, at the worst, we are 7 percent and they (SP and BSP) are three times our vote share. But if we were to go out on our own, we are not going to be 7 percent, we will probably once again touch 10, 11 or 12 percent that we have shown repeatedly we can touch,"" he said. ""It will not be correct to write-off the Congress as despite being battered repeatedly in polls, it has about 10 percent vote in the state that has stuck to it which is crucial in many seats,"" Khurshid said.  ",2018-11-30,"Apna Dal,Bharatiya Janata Party,Congress-Mukt Mahagathbandhan,Grand Alliance,Grand Alliance In UP,Grand Alliance In Uttar Pradesh,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Mahagathbandhan,Om Prakash Rajbhar,PoliticsDecoder,Rashtriya Lok Dal,Samajwadi Party,Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party,Uttar Pradesh","Ahead of 2019, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati devise new formula for mahagathbandhan, one which keeps Congress out",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ahead-of-2019-akhilesh-yadav-and-mayawati-devise-new-formula-for-mahagathbandhan-one-which-keeps-congress-out-5644651.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sandipan Sharma,"Navjot Singh Sidhu is practicing in Punjab what the Congress is pursuing across India — an overt realignment towards the Right of Centre. While Rahul Gandhi is trying to position himself, ergo the Congress, as a devoted   (one who wears the sacred thread) with a Hindu lineage, Sidhu has taken over the role of becoming the face of Sikhism in Punjab. So, those who are under the illusion that Sidhu is letting his heart race ahead of political pragmatism better get this straight: There is a method to his madness, and it is called the pursuit of a panthic agenda. The wily Sardar is trying to upstage the Akalis at their own game and, simultaneously, also become a viable replacement (not alternative) for Captain Amarinder Singh as and when the incumbent chief minister retires from politics. To understand Sidhu's politics, let’s go back to the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections in Punjab. In the run-up to the polls, two major events were playing out in the Punjab theatre. First, AAP was drawing huge crowds and support in rural areas of Punjab. Many of supporters, it was believed then, were disgruntled Akali voters searching for an alternative. Two, the Congress was struggling to address the leadership question. While Rahul Gandhi was keen on trying out a young set of leaders, he had to ultimately succumb to pressure from Amarinder, who dropped veiled hints of quitting the Congress — something that had the potential to damage the Congress. The AAP began to self-destruct just before the elections and gradually turned into a non-entity. But, Sidhu knows that the soft-Sikhism appeal that helped AAP make initial gains in Punjab is still a viable poll strategy. Also, he knows Amarinder is growing old and there will be soon be a vacancy in the Congress for a leader who is both urban and, like the chief minister who quit the party after Operation Blue Star, acceptable to Sikhs in the hinterland. Sidhu's public posturing on the Kartarpur corridor — a bridge that allows Indian pilgrims visa-free travel to Guru Nanak’s final resting place in Pakistan — is a calculated ploy aimed at fulfilling his own ambition of becoming the leader of the Sikhs and, thus, the Chief Minister of Punjab. You can ridicule, criticise and vilify Sidhu as much as you want, but he knows the political advantages of wooing the majority community in a Sikh-dominated state. That Kartarpur is important for every political party is evident. Asked about its importance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi compared it with the fall of the Berlin Wall. This is a logical extension of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's desire to have the corridor opened during his historic bus trip to Lahore. The Akalis, similarly, do not want to miss the bus, a desire revealed by Harsimrat Kaur Badal's presence at the ceremony on the Pakistan side of the corridor. A day earlier, she was the star guest at the ground-breaking ceremony in Gurdaspur. Pakistan now has an unconventional prime minister. In Sidhu, Punjab has an unconventional politician — someone who wears many turbans with ease and chutzpah. Their camaraderie is capable of producing unconventional results. Sidhu, we can be sure, is aware of the potential of this cricketer-turned-peacemaker partnership. The problem with Sidhu, however, is that he is impulsive, ambitious, impatient, rebellious and a compulsive talker. He is perhaps from the school of thought that says, I can't bend my head even if it is severed. These traits sometimes force him to self-combust. Several years ago, he ruined his cricket career by walking out of the Indian team midway through a series in England. His act was reportedly triggered by his refusal to let then Indian skipper Mohammad Azharuddin belittle and denigrate him. Had he not taken the rash decision to quit and exercised restraint, perhaps his career would have taken a different route, keeping in mind Azhar's eventual fall from grace. Similarly, as a BJP lawmaker, Sidhu had frequent run-ins with the Akalis, a feud that led to his eventual departure from the saffron brigade. A few weeks later, he got into ego clashes with Arvind Kejriwal, whose party was keen to snare Sidhu into its fold, because he was adamant on being projected the face of the AAP campaign in Punjab. The point is: Sidhu lets his ambition run ahead of him. And when it is thwarted, he turns on his own allies and mentors. He also suffers from the Subramanian Swamy syndrome: An ailment that makes a public figure a compulsive talker, seeker of controversies, dispenser of wisdom and the final word on almost everything. An ambitious person with a penchant for frequent rebellion and desire for compulsive articulation of every brainwave always runs the risk of harming himself and those around him. 
Sidhu's Kartarpur politics is loaded with potential for him and his party.

Press Trust of India,"Three-time Shiv Sena MLA Vijay Auti on Friday was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Earlier, Harshvardhan Sakpal of the Congress and Independent legislator Bacchu Kadu withdrew their nomination papers. The announcement of the election was made by Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil escorted Auti to the seat of the Deputy Speaker which is next to that of the Leader of Opposition. Fadnavis described Auti as a leader rooted to the ground who enjoys unstinted support from his constituents in Parner Assembly seat in Ahmednagar district. 
The NCP's Ajit Pawar said the post was lying vacant for four years and the appointment indicates the BJP and Shiv Sena have patched up and an alliance between the two saffron parties was a possibility. Pawar said, as per tradition, the deputy speaker's post goes to the opposition but the tradition was not followed by the Congress-NCP government either. ""We thought Fadnavis would revert to the tradition,"" Pawar added. Vikhe Patil, Ganpatrao Deshmukh (PWP), Water Conservation MInister Ram Shinde, who hails from Ahmednagar district, congratulated Auti on his election. The 13th Assembly was the one without a Deputy Speaker for the longest time. The post had been lying vacant since the BJP government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis assumed office on October 31, 2014 and won the trust vote on 12 November. The Congress' Vasant Purke was the last deputy speaker before 2014. In 288-member House, the BJP is the largest party with 122 MLAs, followed by the Shiv Sena with 63, the Congress with 42 and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with 41. During the Sena-BJP rule between 1995-99, Sharad Tasare of Congress held the post of Deputy Speaker.Later, during the 15-year rule of the Congress-NCP, the speaker's post was with the NCP while the Congress had its nominee on the Deputy speaker's post. Of the 22 deputy speakers so far, a majority were from the Congress party. Gajananrao Garud, who served as deputy speaker between 21 March, 1978 and 5 April, 1979, was an Independent MLA. Suryakant Dongre, who held the post between 7 April, 1979 and 9 June, 1980 belonged to the Republican Party of India (Khobragade group). Kamalkishore Kadam (1 March, 1985 to 22 June, 1986) was from the Congress (Socialist) which at the time was headed by current NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. Laxman Alias Anna Joshi, who was the deputy speaker from 20 October, 1990 and 3 July, 1991, was from the BJP while Moreshwar Termude (19 July, 1991 to March 11, 1995) was from the Janata Party. Before the state of Maharashtra came into existence in 1960, there were five deputy speakers of the Legislative Assembly of Bombay Province, which later came to be known as the bilingual Bombay State. The Congress' Shanmugappa Angadi was deputy speaker of the Assembly of Bombay Province from 1946 to 1952. Deendayal Gupta, who was the deputy speaker of the 
bilingual state from 20 June, 1957 to 30 April, 1960, went on to become the first deputy speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on 1 May, 1960.

Kashif Kakvi,"The epicentre of the farmers’ protest in Madhya Pradesh and a fortress of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – Malwa region – registered a record high voting percentage of 84.19 percent in the   held on 28 November. After the death of six farmers in   on 6 June, 2017, farmers' protests had erupted in several districts, including Mandsaur, Ratlam, Neemuch, Ujjain, Shajapur, Agar Malwa, Sehore and rural areas of Indore. Malwa is the biggest region in the state, and the road to electoral power here goes through this region. No party can form a government if it is defeated in this region. which has around 66 Assembly seats, which account for nearly 30 percent of the total strength of the Assembly. The highest jump in the voting percentage as compared to the previous election (4.2 percent) has been recorded in Neemuch district, which is adjacent to Mandsaur. Sehore reported the second highest increase of 4 percent, while Shajapur recorded the lowest increase of 1.8 percent, according to data provided by the state election commission. A total 74.85 percent voters cast their ballots from a total voting population 5.4 crore. According to political experts and journalists, a four percent jump in farmer-dominated areas and other rural areas of the state indicates voters’ anger against the government. Farmers have been protesting over the failure of the Bhawantar Bhugtan Scheme, glitches in crop insurance, not getting the actual minimum support price, problems they faced at   and the killing of six farmers in Mandsaur. They have also sought the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations. “The high turnout in the farmer-dominated districts, including Bundelkhand, indicates voters’ anger against the government, and that the BJP government failed to please the farmers,” said senior journalist SA Pateriya. He further said “If we look at the voting percentage of rural and urban areas, there is a major difference. For example, people in rural areas of Indore district have voted in large numbers, in comparison to the urban areas, and there is a difference of almost 4 to 5 percent between the two.” Ahead of the 2013 Assembly elections, Narendra Modi (then chief minister of Gujarat) addressed 11 rallies in the Malwa region. The BJP had secured a stunning victory in 56 out of 66 Assembly seats in the region. The Congress was left with only nine seats, while one seat went to an Independent. Another political expert Girja Shankar sees this jump in a different way. He said that if there had been anger against the government coupled with a rise in the voting percentage, then the ruling party would have borne the brunt. This had happened in 2003, when voters were angry with the Congress, and the voting percentage rose by 2 percent. “But in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress failed to convert voters’ disappointment into anger. Indeed, the voting percentage has risen in the Malwa region, but since the Congress failed to cash in on the opportunity, the ruling party may retain power despite all odds and a high turnout.” Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Sharma, along with 500 farmers, had visited more than 300 blocks of the Malwa region after the Mandsaur shooting, and had appealed to voters to come out in large numbers to cast their ballots. “Such a rise in the voter turnout is an indication of a change in the government. The farmers have expressed their anger against the government. It is clear that the BJP will be thrown out, and Congress will form the government with a clear majority.” Amritlal Patidar, another farmer leader, and the main accused in the Mandsaur protests case, said, ""After the killing of our fellow farmers last year, the farmers of the Malwa region have pledged to vote out this anti-farmer government in the upcoming election...The high turnout is an indication of voters’ anger.” When asked for the reason behind the anger, Patidar mentioned a slew of reasons. He said that the Bhawantar Bhugtan Scheme, which was launched after the Mandsaur farmers' protest, has been benefiting businessmen and not farmers. ""Since then, the prices of major crops have crashed to a record low. Instead of punishing the police officers who opened fire on farmers, the state government has given a clean chit to them. Besides, the government has booked thousands of innocent farmers on allegations of creating unrest in the area, and they are running from pillar to post to end this case."" Speaking on the issue, senior journalist Ashutosh Shukla said, “The voter turnout was high in drought-hit Bundelkhand. In many places, BJP leaders were shouted away because people are unhappy with the current regime. In this context, the high voting percentage may not hold positive news for the BJP."" State Congress chief Kamal Nath said, “The high turnout shows the anger of voters against the current government. The people want to overthrow the BJP and bring the Congress to power.” Hitting back at the Congress, BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya tweeted, “The record turnout shows voters' trust in the BJP, and their willingness to give us another chance.” The counting of votes is on 11 December.",2018-11-30,"Assembly Election 2018,Bhawantar Bhugtan Scheme,BJP,Congress,Farmers,Kamal Nath,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election,Malwa,Mandsaur Firing,PoliticalPlay,Shivraj Singh Chouhan","Madhya Pradesh elections: High turnout in Malwa, farmers' anger may mean bad news for BJP, say political experts",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-elections-high-turnout-in-malwa-farmers-anger-may-mean-bad-news-for-bjp-say-political-experts-5648891.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": Former Union Minister and Odisha MLA Dilip Roy, and senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra resigned from the party on Friday. Besides sending a joint resignation letter to BJP president Amit Shah, Roy, who represents Rourkela constituency in the Odisha Assembly, also resigned as legislator. Roy said he called on Assembly Speaker Pradip Amat Friday morning and tendered his resignation from the membership of the House. 
""It is with deep anguish that I have decided to quit as the member of State Legislative Assembly as well as from the membership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" Roy said in a twitter post. Both the leaders had for a long been alleging delay in construction of a second bridge over the Brahmani river, establishment of a super-speciality hospital in Rourkela and lack of job opportunities for local youths in Paradip oil refinery. Mohapatra told reporters that the interest of the state is important and their future course would be announced after about a fortnight. He also alleged that their suggestions and views were ignored by the party. In the resignation letter to the BJP national president, Roy and Mahapatra said, ""We regret to state that despite repeated efforts in appraising you on the sorry state of affairs of the party here, neither you nor any senior central party leader bothered to consult, review or take corrective measures.""

The letter claimed that the people of Odisha were ""disillusioned."" ""Several leaders in the party here shared our concerns, but remain silent fearing denial of tickets. You would agree that such silence is a bad sign for any democratic party,"" it said. ""Well-meaning suggestions by us were construed as a threat by certain ego-centric self-serving politicians who resorted to dirty tricks and a campaign was launched in our respective constituencies to try and deride us,"" the letter said. Noting that they cannot be treated as ""furniture"" in the party, Roy and Mahapatra said, ""For us, the interest of the state is supreme.

The panel had suggested that looking at exceptional circumstances and extra-ordinary situations generated on declaring Marathas as socially and educationally backward and their consequential entitlement to reservation benefits, the government may take appropriate decision within constitutional provision to address the emerging scenario in the state.

Approximately 400 announcements were included in the document. AICC general secretary Avinash Pande, Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot, former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and chairman of the manifesto committee Harish Choudhary released  .

Sursingh Rajpurohit," Osmania University in Hyderabad has nurtured many a political stalwart in its 100-year history. This tradition will transition into this Assembly elections as well, with several former and current student leaders in fray. Many of them are going up against bigwigs like Akbaruddin Owaisi of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) floor leader and former state unit president Kishan Reddy and Telangana health minister C Laxma Reddy. The move could be an effort by young leaders to kickstart their political careers the way previous Osmania alumni, including Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, PV Narasimha Rao, C Vidyasagar Rao, N Kiran Kumar Reddy, Jaipal Reddy, Keshav Rao, V Hanumantha Rao, and Muralidhar Rao. Major political parties in the region have tried their best to mobilise the student community and recruit leaders who played a key role in the Telangana statehood movement. However, only a few were successful in drawing them to mainstream politics — either by giving them an Assembly ticket or by promising a key post in the parties. While some of the student leaders are contesting the elections as independent candidates, several others aligned with smaller parties after being denied tickets by major political outfits. This development reflects how student movements are still integral to state politics in Telangana. This reporter met some of these student leaders to assess their vision and analyse their poll strategy against senior politicians. Here's what they had to say: A former national executive member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) — the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — and an alumna of Osmania University who joined the BJP recently, Syed Shahzadi is pitted against Akbaruddin Owaisi from the Chandrayan Gutta Assembly constituency, which the AIMIM leader has claimed for four consecutive terms since 1999. ""People living in this area are flooded with problems that were neglected by the legislators in power for decades. The leaders who claim to be the representatives of the minority community have not done anything for the community or the constituency,"" Shahzadi said, blaming Owaisi for neglecting the youth and not carrying out developmental works in the Old City. Stressing the need for women's empowerment, education and skill development, the novice contender also promised to create educational institutes for women and skill development centers if voted to power. She also blamed the sitting MLA for failing to bring metro services and banking facilities to the constituency. Accusing the AIMIM of believing in divisive politics by creating differences along the lines of caste, creed and religion, Shahzadi said her party believed in the development of all. A research scholar who leads a Joint Action Committee at Osmania University, Nijjana Ramesh was picked by the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) to contest from Amberpet against three-time BJP legislator Kishan Reddy, who won the last election by a whopping 60,000 votes. Citing how his mentor and TJS founder M Kodandaram allotted two seats to university students despite having only a few seats from the alliance, Ramesh said he would take the opportunity to use his 14 years of experience in student politics and be the voice of the student community and unemployed youth of the state. ""The youth should be empowered as they have the zeal to rise for a good cause. We proved it during the statehood movement,"" Ramesh said, adding that welfare schemes should reach the downtrodden and they should be able to enjoy the fruits of development. ""Students and youth across the state are looking towards Kodandaram, and I'm sure they will vote for the people's alliance."" A student leader from Osmania University, Kongala Pandu filed his nomination on a Samajwadi Party ticket and will take on state health minister Dr Laxma Reddy, who is the incumbent candidate from the Jadcherla Assembly constituency. He had won the seat in 2014 as well as in 2004. ""All major political parties are neglecting our university students and their leaders who were instrumental in the Telangana statehood movement. So many of us chose smaller parties like the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Bahujan Left Front, or are contesting as independent candidates. We want to prove that elections can be fought without corrupt practices, and I'm sure we will win with our sincere efforts,"" he said. ""My opponents may be powerful candidates, but my local support in Jadcherla will help me win the elections,"" Pandu declared confidently, adding that the present legislator was neglecting problems such as industrial pollution, erratic supply of drinking water and irrigation woes. He vowed that if voted to power, he would work to resolve these issues. Anji Yadav, a Backward Classes leader at Osmania, chose the Kodad Assembly segment to make his political debut against sitting MLA N Padmavathi Reddy, wife of Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy. He is contesting the polls as an independent candidate. ""The leaders governing the constituency are not as powerful as presented in the media. It is just a perception. None of them were seen in the Telangana statehood agitation. I had participated in that cause and was even sent to jail for it,"" he said. He also accused the incumbent legislator from Kodad of neglecting the Backward Classes community and not visiting many villages during her five-year term. ""So I decided to be the voice of Backward Classes community, which has been neglected over the years, and I'm sure that people will vote for me... The public has also realised that though the Backward Classes constitute over 50 percent of the total population, they are still kept away from political power."" Furthermore, Yadav urged youngsters to enter politics. ""The old leaders of age-old parties are not giving enough chances to young students. This is the reason I'm contesting this election as an independent,"" he said, adding that his candidature got a positive response from all sections of people in Kodad constituency. J Kalyan Nayak, the current vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Telangana, chose Devarakonda constituency for his entry into mainstream politics. He is a research scholar in the Department of Political Science as well as the chairman of the Unemployed Youth Joint Action Committee at Osmania University. ""Since students across the state are facing unemployment issues, they will play a key role in the upcoming Assembly polls and vote for student leaders like me who can stand up for them and resolve their issues,"" Nayak said. He added that present day politics is ""flooded with corrupt practices, where most political leaders focus on the growth of their individual assets and neglect the public"". ""People of constituency are waiting for a leader who is well-educated and aware of the problems they face. Devarakonda is a tribal-dominated area, and I chose this constituency to serve the people who have been neglected for ages."" Nayak also claimed that the constituents were migrating to other places due to unemployment and fluoride contamination. Several prominent faces like M Krishank, Daruvu Yellana, Bala Laxmi, Manavatha Roy and Durgam Bhasker — who had all played a key role in the Telangana statehood agitation — were denied Congress tickets. While expressing their dissatisfaction with the decision, the student leaders maintained that they will still campaign for the party if asked to as they were not like seasoned politicians who change their political affiliations overnight. ""Some state leaders in the Congress do not recognise the value and respect that Osmania University student leaders have in public. People who have previously lost elections twice or thrice are being recommended because they are close to these leaders,"" Yellana claimed, adding that the party also cited its financial status and the unwillingness of local leaders as reasons behind student leaders being denied tickets. Bhasker alleged that the present state and district leaders in Telangana see student leaders ""as a threat to their positions"". ""They only need puppets who act according to their wishes. We are not demanding tickets without putting in any efforts. We have been in the battlefield since the Telangana movement,"" he said. “As Dr BR Ambedkar said, political power is the master key. We thought a political party would provide us with a common platform where we can raise our voices and chose the Congress as it gave us our state. But denying us tickets has sent a negative message in the student community,"" Bhasker pointed out. Laxmi, another student leader at Osmania University, said the Congress should have fielded at least a few student leaders to convey a message that the Grand Old Party stood with the community. ""Although denied tickets, we are ready to campaign for the party if called upon,"" Laxmi added. Roy said that the welfare of Telangana and providing employment opportunities to the youth were ""more important than my candidature"". Noting that the party had given a chance to former student leaders of Osmania University such as Addanki Dayakar, Dr Sravan Dasoju and Medipally Satyam, he said, ""We had participated in the Telangana movement not for our individual benefits but for the welfare of the people, which is priority, and for that, the Mahakutami — the Grand Alliance of the Congress, Telugu Desam Party, Communist Party of India and TJS —has to come to power, and we all will work for it.""",2018-11-29,"2018 Telangana SSC Class 10 Result,Assembly Election 2018,Osmania University,Osmania University Student Leaders,PoliticalPlay,Student Leaders,Student Politics,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Elections,Telangana Movement,Telangana Polls,Telangana Student Leaders","Telangana Vidhan Sabha polls: Osmania University's student politicians in fray, but Congress has ignored this crucial group",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/telangana-vidhan-sabha-polls-osmania-universitys-student-politicians-in-fray-but-congress-has-ignored-this-crucial-group-5638431.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Politics,"Punjab culture minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan are unlikely to see eye to eye on any particular matter. However, all three leaders, despite their contrasting stance and agendas, agreed on one thing on Wednesday: That Sidhu's popularity in Pakistan soared during his last two controversial visits to the country. While Harsimrat, who was representing the Government of India at the ground breaking ceremony of Kartarpur Corridor in Pakistan, taunted the Congress leader for his popularity in the 'rival country', Imran said that Sidhu was perhaps the only Indian politician who could easily win an election even in Pakistan. Sidhu himself accepted after   visit in August that the what he got in two days there, he didn’t get in his lifetime here. But as promising as all the love and praise heaped on Sidhu may appear to be, truth remains that Sidhu's political ambitions lie here in India, and not Pakistan. Why then has he brazenly courted controversy when many in his own party remain uncomfortable over his subsequent visits to the neighbouring country? To answer this, it is first important to look at what all Sidhu seems to have lost by tactless praise for Pakistan and Imran. In doing so, Sidhu   from the Opposition in Punjab, and some serious backlash on social media. He also   the subsequent Indian government's efforts in opening the pilgrimage route to first Sikh guru, Nanak Dev's final resting place. A 1.5 kilometre safe passage for visa-free entry of Sikh pilgrims was first envisaged in 1999 by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, it took almost 20 years spanning over the regime of various Indian and Pakistani governments to have reached this point. Furthermore, Sidhu, by appearing alongside a pro-Khalistani Sikh leader in Pakistan, gave the much needed arsenal to the Opposition. Gopal Singh Chawla, who had reportedly   in Lahore to meet Indian Sikh pilgrims, was first seen shaking hands with Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Soon after, Chawla released a photo on his Facebook page (not a verified account) where he was seen hugging Sidhu. The BJP attacked Sidhu over the picture as party leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, asked Sidhu whether he cared for India’s sovereignty and Punjab’s peace. Harsimrat, who was observing protocol in Paksitan, lashed out at Sidhu once she reached India. Speaking to  , she said, ""He (Imran Khan) offered him (Navjot Singh Sidhu) to fight elections from Pakistan. He (Sidhu) seems to have more love and respect in Pakistan than what I noticed over here. He has some good relationships over there."" The picture was especially embarrassing for the Congress as Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh   an invitation to attend the event citing Pakistani conspiracy to disturb peace in Punjab.  In an interview to   on Tuesday, Amarinder said that he had advised Sidhu against the visit and had told him he was taking a stand on Pakistan terror. ""Yet he went,"" he said. ""Sidhu gets carried away sometimes,"" he said. Leaders of the Congress party have decided to stay silent on the issue, except Tripat Bajwa who came out against Sidhu openly after Amarinder's comments. But Sidhu may have decided to go ahead with his 'pro-peace' agenda, in face of all the criticism, seeking to burnish his credentials among the Sikh electorate in Punjab. He already seems to be getting support from unexpected quarters. According to a report in  several radical Sikh outfits have praised Sidhu and even demanded the title of Fakhr-e-Quam from Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee (SGPC) for him. Groups like All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) and Dal Khalsa have hailed Sidhu for his 'courage' to leverage his friendship with Imran for the benefit of the nation. The report further said, that internally within the Congress, the mood is not entirely against Sidhu. Many party leaders believe that retrospectively, Sidhu's move will help Congress government claim credit for the Kartarpur Corridor, even if the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP may have sidelined them now. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor also came out in support of Sidhu.  Moreover, some members of the Sikh community from outside India also congratulated Sidhu for his pro-peace approach.     quoted Daljit Singh Khalsa, former General Secretary of Stockton (California state) Gurdwara Sahib as saying, ""Sidhu did great work on both religious and Indo- Pak relations fronts which forced the Centre government to take an early decision on this which is directly related to Sikh religion."" Sidhu's   have been an open secret ever since he quit BJP and subsequently toyed with the idea of joining Aam Aadmi Party or launching his own outfit before joining Congress. Even at the time of joining Congress, when it became clear that Sidhu's chief ministerial ambitions may have to take a back seat, the cricketer turned politician made a cryptic remark when pestered over his chances of leading the Punjab government. "" ? (The wheat is in the fields, the child is yet to be born and you are making preparations for the wedding),""   to persisted questions on becoming the chief minister. In contrast, 76-year-old Amarinder had previously hinted that he may not run for another term as chief minister owing to his advancing age.

FP Staff,"While political rhetoric surrounding the Kartarpur Sahib corridor plays out in India and Pakistan — with the project caught in a scramble for credit between New Delhi and Islamabad, Gopal Singh Chawla, a pro-Khalistan leader, is back in the limelight after his handshake with Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Chawla was spotted with Bajwa at the ground-breaking ceremony for the long-awaited Kartarpur corridor which will facilitate visa-free travel for Sikh pilgrims to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur on Wednesday. Known to be one of the key Khalistani activists seeking a separate homeland for the Sikh community, Chawla is   the general secretary of Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. A video accessed by  shows Chawla inciting people in the name of the ""Khalistani cause"". He can be seen hailing Pakistan for being committed to the 'cause of Khalistan' and slammed India for ""trying to convert the nation into Hindustan"". The pro-Khalistani leader also called upon the audience to commit to the cause of Khalistan and be ""ready for sacrifice"". He could be also be heard likening Khalistan's ""freedom struggle"" to that of Kashmir and repeated his demand for ""Referendum 2020"". Various pro-Khalistan organisations headed by 'Sikhs for Justice' demand a plebiscite in Punjab to demand a separate nation under Referendum 2020,   reported. Chawla had on 14 April stopped Indian officials from visiting a Gurudwara in Lahore to meet Sikh pilgrims who had travelled from India. In a viral video, Chawla could be heard telling the officials that there are Khalistani supporters inside, reported  He  was also involved in pasting photos of ‘Referendum 2020’ outside gurdwaras in Pakistan when the Sikh pilgrims from India had visited the neighbouring country on Baisakhi. Two days earlier, Indian officials were stopped from meeting the Sikh pilgrims when they reached Wagah — the first station after a train crosses over to Pakistan, reported  . Chawla is also believed to have ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed and the two also seemed to have shared a dais in the past, a picture of which is in the public domain, reports  . Photographic evidence had also emerged that Pakistan based terror-outfits Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) were backing Sikh militants as LeT chief Saeed was seen with Chawla in Lahore, reported  . New Delhi has time and again pointed fingers at Pakistan for supporting terrorists forces against India, including Saeed's LeT. Chawla's alleged connection with Saeed came to the fore again after the Amritsar grenade blast on 18 November in which three people were killed and several injured. The blast occurred at a religious gathering on the outskirts of Amritsar and   took place when members of the Nirankari sect were gathered at Nirankari Bhawan at Rajasansi village near the Amritsar international airport. A day later,  , had revealed pictures of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed meeting Chawla a few months prior, claiming that their meeting could be related to the attack. Senior Congress leader and former Ludhiana MP Manish Tewari agreed with the chief minister, describing the blast as the ISI’s attempt to reactivate the Khalistan file, as reported by  Tewari drew linkages between Sunday’s attack and the first Akali-Nirankari clashes of 13 April, 1978 in Amritsar. ""It all started on 13 April, 1978 like this. The ISI has activated its Khalistan file again... The recent terror attacks in Gurdaspur, Pathankot and now Amritsar are the ISI's gameplan,” said Tewari. In an interview on Pakistan's  , Chawla can be heard saying: ""The Sikh community's bonding with Pakistan is similar to Pakistan's relationship with Saudi Arabia."" Cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Thursday, came under fire once again when his picture with Khalistani activist Gopal Singh Chawla appeared on the social media. Sidhu's picture came a day after Chawla was spotted with Bajwa during the Kartarpur event.

Srinivasa Prasad,"Will Narendra Modi attack HD Deve Gowda? This question was asked before the prime minister began his campaign for the May 2018 Karnataka Vidhan Sabha election. This was because of the talk doing the rounds at that time that BJP and Gowda's Janata Dal (Secular) might join hands to checkmate Congress in case of a hung Assembly in Karnataka. Will Modi attack Telangana's caretaker chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR)? This was asked before Modi launched his campaign for the 7 December Telangana Vidhan Sabha election. This was because of the possibility of KCR’s ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) joining hands with BJP when the die is cast in future. In Karnataka, although Modi first heaped praise on Gowda, he later advised people not to ""waste"" their votes by supporting the JD(S). This didn't stop the BJP from making an unsuccessful effort to get Gowda's support to form government after the election. But tge Congress beat BJP to it and teamed up with JD(S) and stole the government. In Telangana, Modi didn't mince his words in attacking KCR. At a couple of election rallies this week,   for having done nothing during his four-and-a-half years of ""family rule"" in the state. The Karnataka-Telangana similarity doesn’t end there. Like in Karnataka before, each party in Telangana accuses the others of having secret alliances. Before polling in Karnataka, Congress accused the JD(S) of having a covert understanding with the BJP. On its part, the BJP spoke of a sinister deal between the Congress and JD(S) during the run-up to the election. It's worse in Telangana. The only open and official alliance in Telangana is called the Mahakutami — or Grand Alliance — comprising Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) headed by M Kodandaram, a key leader who had fought for the separate state of Telangana, and CPI. Ranged against this alliance is the TRS, with BJP being only an also-ran. This is the official lineup. Now look at the allegedly unofficial ones. Congress accuses TRS and BJP of having a hush-hush deal, an allegation that is not entirely without basis. In what passes off as sparkling wit and biting sarcasm in post-Modi elections, Congress president Rahul Gandhi dropped a pearl of wisdom saying that  . The case of TRS and BJP may be like the story of Antony and Cleopatra, two lovers with an on-again and off-again romance, whose future nobody was sure about till the end. Nobody can deny that it was only after a wink and a nod from BJP that KCR, in the first place, dissolved the Telangana Vidhan Sabha on 6 September and went in for elections that would have otherwise been held many months later along with the Lok Sabha polls. And nobody has forgotten that KCR supported the BJP in matters including demonetisation and the presidential election. A key element of Modi's oratory in Telangana was an insinuation that meant indicated the Congress and TRS were hand-in-glove. This is a wild allegation, for which there is neither an ideological nor circumstantial basis, but in the ongoing season of post-truth polemics, decibels drown out facts. That's not all. TRS has a ""friendly” relationship — but no alliance— with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM), a rabble-rousing Muslim party led by Asaduddin Owaisi who, for the record, swears by nothing less than the world’s finest secularism. Owaisi’s party is contesting only eight seats, leaving most of the Muslim-dominated constituencies for TRS to win. When Modi said the Congress and TDP were two sides of the same coin, he fired up the imagination of a Congress leader. He said that, if any coin could have three sides, that would be TRS, AIMIM and BJP. One conspiracy theory comes from KCR himself. According to him, Naidu has ganged up with the Congress (as part of the Mahakutami) with the nefarious design of remote-controlling Telangana, whose formation as a separate state the Andhra Pradesh chief minister had opposed. ""Do we still want Andhra hegemony?"" asks KCR, who had been at the forefront of the agitation for a separate Telangana state. Yet another conspiracy theory is what Congress leaders toss around. It's that the BJP's attacks on KCR are aimed at dividing the anti-incumbency vote against his government and indirectly helping him come back to power. That amounts to saying that BJP is campaigning against TRS to make sure that the TRS wins! It's easy to see that a TRS victory would suit the BJP better than a win by the Mahakutami. That's only because, a triumph of the alliance could boost the morale of Naidu and others who are advocating a Congress-inclusive front to fight BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. But saying that the entire gamut of BJP leadership including Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath are descending on Telangana only to indirectly ensure a TRS victory not only stretches our collective imagination, but even strains our sanity. The only thing that can be said with any amount of certainty at this point is that KCR, who had opted for early elections with the brash confidence of expecting a cakewalk, is now clearly rattled by the coming-together of Naidu and the Congress, whose combined vote share of 39.5 percent in the 2014 election  . Similarities between the Karnataka and Telangana Vidhan Sabha elections may even extend to the final result. That’s what the BJP hopes. The party hopes that, like Karnataka, Telangana will turn out an uncertain election result, and if that happens, it wants to be the kingmaker. But that hope of BJP rests on another hope: That the party will win a sizable number of seats, at least in double digits. In 2014, BJP won only five seats and 7.1 percent of the votes (in alliance with the TDP). ""What we are staring at,""  , ""Is in all probability a hung kind of an Assembly and the BJP emerging as a decisive player."" The projection by Rao, a psephologist and politician rolled into one, is possible if not probable. But what Rao doesn’t talk about is that even for the kingmaker’s position, BJP has competition.   in case of a hung result. If that happens, there can be no doubt whom Owaisi will support. He has already declared that Telangana is doomed unless KCR returns as chief minister. But, for a party that spoke of ""sweeping"" Telangana as late as last year, it's a great come-down for the BJP now to aspire to become only a kingmaker.",2018-11-29,"Amit Shah,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,K Chandrashekar Rao,Narendra Modi,PoliticalPlay,Rahul Gandhi,TDP,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Polls 2018,Telangana Vidhan Sabha Election 2018,TRS",Telangana Vidhan Sabha election gets new twist with talk of 'secret' alliances; also-ran BJP hopes to be 'kingmaker',https://www.firstpost.com/politics/telangana-vidhan-sabha-election-gets-new-twist-with-talk-of-secret-alliances-also-ran-bjp-hopes-to-be-kingmaker-5639131.html,firstpost,-1,0

The planned corridor will connect Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev's final resting place in Pakistan's Kartarpur to the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Punjab's Gurdaspur district in India, fulfilling a long-pending demand of the Sikh community.

FP Staff,"Amid a controversy over a photograph with Pakistan Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee general secretary Gopal Singh Chawla, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday denied that he knew the identity of the pro-Khalistani leader. Sidhu gave the statement after returning to India, following his visit to Pakistan for the groundbreaking ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor project. ""The blessings and dreams of 12 crore Guru Nanak followers have now turned into reality,"" Sidhu said while addressing the media after crossing the Wagah border. He said that he was hopeful of peace with Pakistan. ""The ice between India and Pakistan is melting. Mountains can be moved if people agree to talk. It's time to brush aside trivial affairs. It's time to end the tale of India-Pakistan enmity,"" he said. Sidhu, who had already been receiving criticism for attending the event, sparked a new controversy when Chawla shared a photograph of the two on his Facebook page. At the ceremony on Thursday, Chawla was also seen shaking hands with Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. 
 The Shiromani Akali Dal lashed out at Sidhu and asked him if ""India is his priority"" or not. ""There was a link between Gopal Chawla and a terrorist attack that took place in Amritsar (on Nirankari Bhavan), which is his (Sidhu's) constituency.

Team 101Reporters," Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were first deployed by the Election Commission of India in 1999 during Goa Assembly elections. Two decades later, every time India votes, it still somehow begins with complaints related to faulty or malfunctioning EVMs which leads to loss of crucial voting hours. On Wednesday, even as the excited lot of early electorates in Madhya Pradesh reached their respective polling booths, not everyone had a smooth run at voting. Videos were shared from various polling booths showing voters waiting for Election Commission officials to fix the malfunctioning EVMs and VVPAT machines. Chief Electoral Officer for Madhya Pradesh, V L Kantha Rao, got a first hand experience of the persistent trouble with electronic voting apparatus when he had to wait for half an hour before casting his vote at the Char Imli VVIP polling booth in Bhopal. While widespread failure of EVMs during mock polls delayed the start of voting process in many constituencies by half an hour to two hours, a proportional number of technical snags were reported while voting was in process until 3 pm. Addressing media at 3 pm, CEO Rao said that a total of 1,545 of VVPAT units, 563 Ballot Units and 583 Control Units were replaced till 3 pm, including the 732 VVPAT units, 352 BUs and 369 CUs that had to be replaced during mock polls. Satna district, where 20 percent EVM units had to be replaced, was the worst affected, said Rao, and added that extra units had to be brought in from neighbouring district Rewa when Satna ran out of stock. Hundreds of voters returned to their homes in the district after waiting over an hour. The state recorded 50 percent voting till 3 pm, and Rao claimed the final turnout was expected to touch the target figure of 80 percent. After 12 pm, the Election Commission officials in Madhya Pradesh said at least 250 EVMs had been replaced in the ongoing elections. The number is likely to increase as reports of more such instances pour in. At several places, even the machines that were substituted did not function properly, and had to be replaced. The areas that reported technical snags in EVMs included Mandla, Char Imli, Betul, Harda, Indore, Bhopal and Satna, among other constituencies. While poll officials at polling booth 42 in Rampur Baghelan, Satna, were waiting for new machines to arrive as allotted EVMs malfunctioned, the voters had started to return without casting their votes after having waited for hours. Wednesday morning polling could only start after a delay of two to three hours at several polling booths after the glitch was reported. For example, voting at the Tilak Nagar booth in Indore-5 constituency, where first vote was cast at 10.54 am, was halted after a glitch was reported. At booth no: 96 in Harda, crucial 40 minutes were lost due to a technical snag. Voting process had to be halted due to EVM glitches in at least 26 booths across Bhopal, according to reports till 1pm. Videos from the Pusali village in Betul constituency showed voters squatted on the ground around the polling booth as they waited for polling to resume. “We have been waiting for two hours but the machine is not working,” said one irate male voter upon noticing a mobile camera approaching him. State Congress president Kamal Nath alleged that the voting seemed to be affecting areas which were Congress stronghold and suggested that the Election Commission must consider re-polling in constituencies where fair practice was questionable. His party colleague and Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner seeking an extension of polling time at the booths where voting hours were lost due to EVM and VVPAT malfunctioning. CEC O P Rawat responded saying that it was up to the local officers to take a call on extending polling time. Congress leader   that EVM malfunctioning was being reported from polling booths that had a favourable mood towards Congress. He advised Congress polling agents to note down the number of the changed machines and check the machine by casting 50-100 votes as mock poll. Congress candidate from Bhopal-Madhya, Arif Masood filed a written complaint with the Election Commission stating that voting begun late by at least two hours at more than two dozen polling booths in his constituency and urged the Election Commission to give additional time to voters. Many women voters left polling booth 159 in Burhanpur without casting their vote as the process was halted for about one and a half hours despite the Collector and the SP reaching the spot to resolve the issue. Political analyst C K Naidu said that EVMs developing faults on polling day might have a direct impact on voting percent as lot of voters return back after waiting for hours. Reports came from Bhind that voters had created ruckus after waiting in queue for a long time. ""The election commission should also be questioned as to what preparations were done after large scale reporting of EVM faults in by-election in Uttar Pradesh,"" said Naidu. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been reportedly leading a pack of Opposition parties that sought from the EC a reversal to ballot paper voting instead of EVMs for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Several petitions have been filed by political parties at various courts, including the Supreme Court, against the possibility of tampering of EVMs. Responding to these petitions, the EC on its website said the credibility, reliability and robustness of EVMs has been validated by various high courts in all the cases after detailed analysis of various aspects of technological security and administrative safeguards around use of EVMs. In response to a FAQ about EVMs that go “out of order”, the EC said: “If an EVM of a particular polling station goes out of order, the same is replaced with a new one. The votes recorded until the stage when the EVM went out of order remains safe in the memory of the Control Unit and it is perfectly fine to proceed with the polling after replacing the EVM with new EVM and there is no need to start the poll from the beginning. On counting day, votes recorded in both Control Units are counted to give the aggregate result of that polling station.” The EVMs have been devised and designed by the technical experts committee of the ECI in collaboration with Bharat Electronic Limited, Bangalore and Electronic Corporation of India Ltd, Hyderabad, the two public sector undertakings that manufacture the device. CEO Rao informed that 78,870 ballot units (BU) and 65,367 control units (CU) are being used during polls besides 65,367 VVPAT machines. Moreover, 15,548 BU, 12,248 CU and 13812 VVPATS are kept in reserve. About five lakh employees have been engaged to conduct voting at 65,341 polling booths across 230 constituencies in Madhya Pradesh where about 5.04 crore voters will exercise their franchise on Wednesday. Voting was to be conducted between 8am and 5pm in all constituencies barring three that fall under naxal-affected Balaghat district, including Baihar, Lanji and Paraswada.

Adityanath, who has reportedly been of the BJP's star campaigners during the ongoing season of Assembly polls, was campaigning in the Malpura constituency.

According to the report, Adityanath's exponential mentions of Hindu deities has been proportional with saffron organisations' efforts for the Ram Mandir in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya. In Madhya Pradesh, Adityanath kept up his divisive diatribe in response to a video of state Congress chief Kamal Nath asking for Muslim leaders to ensure that 90 percent of the community votes for the Congress. Adityanath, in a blatantly communal comment, said that the  , while ""  was enough"" for the saffron party. According to reports, he also said, ""I recently read a statement by Kamal Nathji that the Congress does not need SC/ST votes. The Congress only wants Muslim votes.""

Press Trust of India," Maharashtra Legislative Assembly will get a deputy Speaker after the longest gap of four years, with the election for the vacant constitutional post being announced on Wednesday. The election will be held on 30 November, Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde said after question hour. The 13th Assembly would have gone down in history as the one without a deputy speaker for the longest gap of period had the elections been not announced. Vasant Purke of the Congress was the last deputy speaker before 2014. He had held the post in the previous assembly. However, the post has been lying vacant since the last four years after the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis assumed office on 31 October, 2014 and won the trust vote on 12 November. Announcing the schedule, the speaker said the process of filing of nominations will begin on Wednesday itself and scrutiny of papers will be done on Thursday. The nominations can be withdrawn by 10.30 am on 30 November. ""The election, if necessary, will be taken up between 11.30 am and 1 pm on 30 November,"" he said. The 13th Assembly has met 15 times since October 2014 when the new government took. The current winter session is the 16th session of the assembly. Deputy Speaker is elected from among the members of the Assembly. In the 288-member House, the BJP is the largest party with 122 MLAs, followed by the Shiv Sena at 63, the Congress with 42 and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with 41. During the Sena-BJP rule between 1995 and 1999, Sharad Tasare of the Congress held the post of Deputy Speaker. Later, during the 15-year rule of the Congress-NCP, the speaker's post was with the NCP while the Congress had its nominee on the deputy speaker's post. Of the 22 deputy speakers so far, the majority were from the Congress party. Gajananrao Garud, who served as deputy speaker between 21 March, 1978 and 5 April, 1979, was an Independent MLA. Suryakant Dongre, who held the post between 7 April, 1979 and 9 June, 1980 belonged to the Republican Party of india (Khobragade group). Kamalkishore Kadam (1 March, 1985 to 22 June, 1986) was from the Congress (Socialist) which at the time was headed by current NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. Laxman Alias Anna Joshi, who was the deputy speaker from 20 October, 1990 to 3 July, 1991, was from the BJP while Moreshwar Termude (19 July, 1991 to 11 March, 1995) was from the Janata Party. Before the state of Maharashtra came into existence in 1960, there were five deputy speakers of the Legislative Assembly of Bombay Province, which later came to be known as the bilingual Bombay State. The Congress' Shanmugappa Angadi was deputy speaker of the Assembly of Bombay Province from 1946 to 1952. Deendayal Gupta, who was the deputy speaker of the bilingual state from 20 June, 1957 to 30 April, 1960, went on to become the first deputy speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on 1 May, 1960.

FP Staff,"Nearly 74.61 percent of voters exercised their franchise till 6 pm Wednesday in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections which were marred by complaints of faulty Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and stray incidents of violence. According to latest updates, 745 EVMs and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines were replaced after complaints of technical snags, Madhya Pradesh's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) VL Kantha Rao said. The number may go up as reports of technical glitches have continued to pour in. This may result in repolling at several booths following complaints of malfunctioning of EVMs, as senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia demanded the Election Commission make up for the time wasted in replacing faulty EVMs by extending the polling time in concerned booths. ""I want the EC to compensate for the time lost in replacing the EVMs. It should extend voting time at places where EVMs failed to work,"" Scindia told reporters after landing in Gwalior to cast his vote. ""I have already spoken to Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat and Madhya Pradesh chief electoral officer VL Kantha Rao over the phone,"" the Lok Sabha member from the state's Guna seat said. Scindia said he wanted maximum people to cast their vote. The poll panel said it may reconsider conducting a re-poll if the officers report that people were unable to cast vote due to technical glitches. ""Our polling agents have been constantly observing and interacting with voters to record all grievances and the rate at which EVMs are malfunctioning is alarming,” Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat said. On the extension of poll time, Rawat said, ""There are provisions for extension of time. Local officials can take a call as they see fit. The matter does not need to be handled by the election commission."" State Congress chief Kamal Nath also expressed concern over complaints of technical snags in EVMs. ""Several reports are coming from across the state that EVMs are not working. This has been affecting the polling. Long queues are being witnessed in the city. EC should immediately take decision. The EVMs should be changed,"" he said in a tweet. Polling was held from 8 am to 5 pm in 227 seats, while in three Assembly segments of Lanji, Paraswada and Baihar in the Naxal-affected Balaghat district, the voting hours were from 7 am to 3 pm. Two polling officials died due to health issues while performing their duties in Indore and Guna districts, Rao said. The families of these employees would be given an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh each, he said. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the Bharatiya Janata Party's candidate from Budhni seat, and his wife Sadhana Singh cast their votes at his native village Jait, which is part of his Assembly constituency. Earlier, Chouhan also offered prayers at a local temple. The Congress  fielded former Union minister Arun Yadav against Chouhan. Kamal Nath cast his vote in Chhindwara district while the party's campaign committee chief Scindia exercised his franchise in Gwalior. Rao said polling was going on peacefully in all the Assembly constituencies and long queues were seen in the Naxal-affected seats and other places. However, some disturbance was reported from Bhind and Morena districts. Reports said three people were arrested after gunshots were fired outside a polling both in Bhind. Meanwhile, reports said around 10 candidates from five seats in the sensitive Bhind district were detained in view of maintaining law and order. The police earlier detained BJP and Congress candidates from Ater in Bhind, Arvind Singh Bhadauriya (BJP) and Hemant Katare (Congress), to prevent any kind of untoward situation. They have been kept at the circuit house. The district is located in the Gwalior-Chambal region. The region is expected to witness tense contest between BJP and Congress. The region has 34 seats. Meanwhile, in Morena, a Congress polling agent was shot and rushed to a hospital in Gwalior in a critical state. In Bhopal North, BJP-Congress workers clashed in Kotwali area following reports that Rs 10 lakh cash was recovered from a BJP minister's car. However no action was taken against Devraj Singh Parihar, a senior BJP leader and a state minister, after initial inquiry. As many as 2,899 candidates, including 1,094 Independents, are in the fray for the 230 seats, but the main contest is between the Congress and BJP – the big two of Madhya Pradesh politics. The state has 5.04 crore eligible voters. Over three lakh government employees, including nearly 45,000 women, are on poll duty. As many as 1.80 lakh security personnel, including those drawn from central paramilitary forces, have also been deployed to ensure free and fair poll, Rao said.",2018-11-28,"Baihar,Balaghat,Bhind,Budhni,Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs),EVM,EVM Malfunction,Gwalior-Chambal Region,Jyotiraditya Scindia,Lanji,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Morena,NewsTracker,OP Rawat,Paraswada","Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls: EVM snags, stray incidents of violence dominate day; 74.61% turnout till 6 pm",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-vidhan-sabha-polls-evm-snags-stray-incidents-of-violence-dominate-day-55-turnout-till-3-30-pm-5633121.html,firstpost,-1,0

  56 percent voter turnout was recorded at Tuikum as of 2.30 on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson from the Election Commission said. Hrangturzo recorded 55 percent, South Tuipui 51 percent,  and Thorang 59 percent, the official said. Forty-two VVPATs, 25 ballot units and 19 control units were replaced, following malfunctions at various polling stations across Mizoram, Chief Electoral Officer Ashish Kundra said. Voter turn out was recorded at 45 percent in Aizawl district and at around 55 percent in Serchhip, chief electoral officer Ashish Kundra said. He said that the overall voter turnout in Mizoram was recorded at 50% till 1.30 pm. Former chief minister of Mizoram Zoramthanga, who was in power from 1998 to 2008, said that he was confident that his party MNF would win this time in a landslide victory. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla cast his vote at Zarkawt at around 12:15 pm. He is hopeful to win simple majority by bagging more than 27 seats. Thanhawla said the Congress would not forge post poll alliance with the BJP. Inspite of contesting in 39 seats, BJP will not win more than five seats in Mizoram this time, vice-president of BJP's Mahila Morcha in Mizoram Vijay Lakshmi Rai said. ""BJP's campaign was better this year but due to this 'Hinduva' tag on the party, we are going to lose in many seats. BJP has never won a seat here, so winning even 2-3 seats is good for us. I hope my party forms government with the help of other like-minded parties after the result,"" Rai said. The overall voter turnout for the 40-member Mizoram  Assembly polls was recorded at 29 percent until 11 am. Until 10.30 am on Wednesday, 664 Bru voters cast their votes at Kanhmun in Mizoram's Mamit district. Brisk polling is underway in Mizoram with nearly 25 percent of 7.68 lakh voters casting their votes in the first three hours on Wednesday, an official said. Men and women dressd in traditional attires were seen queued up outside the many polling stations in all districts well before voting began at 7 am. Around 25 percent of the 7,68,181 voters cast their votes by 10 am, Deputy Additional Chief Electoral Officer CC Lalchhuangkina told   over the phone quoting reports from all eight districts. ""Conducive situation and favourable weather helped the people to exercise their franchise smoothly,"" he added. ""Except for a few EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines)- VVPAT (Voters Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) device malfunctioning, no untoward incident was reported so far. ""Like previous elections, polling was absolutely peaceful. As Mizo society is very disciplined and Church guided, electioneering has always been incident-free in the state,"" he said. Congress has been trying to retain its grip on its last bastion in the North East. The grand old party has been in power since 2008 and is eyeing its third consecutive term, is being led by Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla, who in recent elections thwarted the BJP's attempts to gets its lotus to bloom in the Vidhan Sabha of this Christian-majority state. However, the BJP has reason to be optimistic. From anti-incumbency to alcohol, a variety of factors could make the Congress' quest to retain its hold on power more difficult. Mizoram witnessed a 15 percent voter turnout till 9 am, as per the Chief Election Commission. The voting process started at 7 am and will continue till 4 pm. Polling for Bru refugess will end at 3 pm. Mizoram's international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh, as well as state borders with Tripura, Assam and Manipur, have been sealed since Sunday in view of the polls. Lalthanfela, a differently-abled first-time voter cast his vote at Zarkawt-II in Aizawl, and said that he hopes that Congress retains power in Mizoram. Young voters in the state want infrastructure development, improvement of road and education system. Incumbent chief minister Lal Thanhawla is also slated to cast his vote at Zarkawt-II in Aizawl, which falls under Aizawl North-III constituency. Of the 865 voters at this polling station, 107 voters have so far cast their votes since 7 am. The area's sitting Congress MLA Lal Thanzara, who also holds the health portfolio, cast his vote at 7 am as well. He was tipped against MNF nominee C Lalmuanpuia, BJP's VL Awia, ZPM candidate C Lalhmingthanga and Zoramthar Lalremsiama Ralte. Altogether, 47 of 1,179 polling booths have been classified as 'critical' and as many as 'vulnerable' by the Election Commission. Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum demanded setting up a special polling station in a relief camp in Tripura's Kanchanpur to help pregnant women, senior citizens and differently abled people to cast their votes. The Forum's General Secretary Bruno Msha said that the election commission has been made aware of the demand on Tuesday. However, chief electoral officer Ashish Kundra confirms that there are 12,026 Bru voters coming from relief camps in Tripura. Former Mizoram chief minister and MNF leader Zoramthanga rules out the possibility of a hung Assembly, adding that he was confident enough to form the party. He also said that one of the promises that the party would keep is the ban of liquor. ""Congress had failed the Church and the people by selling liquor,"" Zoramthanga said. Eight parties are in the fray for the 40-member Mizoram Assembly. Polling started for the Mizoram Assembly election at 7 am on Wednesday. The total number of candidates this time is 209, almost 67 higher than 2013. Mizo National Front (MNF) Leader Zoramthanga will cast his vote at Aizwal's Ramhlun Venglai. The MNF is an integral regional party which was in power for two terms between 1998-2003 and 2003-2008. The state's electorate is 7,68,181. Gearing up its entire machinery for assembly polls in Mizoram, the authorities have decided to connect all polling booths through wireless communication for the first time leaving no ""shadow areas"" at all. Mizoram, having a difficult hilly terrain, is going for assembly elections on Wednesday to elect 40 MLAs. ""For the first time in Mizoram's election history, all polling booths will be covered by wireless communication. It will help in timely reporting of every development and progress of the polling,"" Mizoram Deputy Inspector General of Police (Training & Armed Branch) Joseph Lalchhuana told   in an interview. Till the last election in 2014 for the Lok Sabha, not all areas were connected through wireless technology and there was a delay in receiving information from far-flung booths, he added. Lalchhuana, who is also the Assistant State Police Nodal Officer for the assembly elections, said: ""By doing this (wireless connection), we have eliminated all shadow areas from Mizoram. Shadow areas means the place where there is no communication."" For operating the system as per the Election Commission of India guidelines, special training sessions were conducted for the Mizoram Police personnel and now everything is in place to conduct the polls efficiently, he added. ""We take pride in it. We have tested it under the direct supervision of our DGP Balaji Srivastava and are fully confident of supporting the Election Commission as and when required,"" Lalchhuana said. Mizoram has 7,70,395 registered voters who will cast their franchise in 1,164 polling booths across the state, while an additional 15 special booths have been created at Kanhmun village in Mamit district for the Bru refugees coming from six camps in Tripura. Lalchhuana said that during the poll campaigning, which ended last evening, the Mizoram Police had formed 84 flying squads, 39 dynamic check posts, 80 static surveillance teams and 80 quick response teams across the state to prevent any unlawful activities. ""We have over 50 zonal police officers in the rank of DSP to SP. They are looking at the macro security arrangements in their respective areas. Above them, we have four grid DIGs along with the existing two range DIGs for overall responsibility,"" he added. Mizoram has 38 police stations and it has recently set up five new outposts for ease of surveillance and confidence-building among voters. ""The total sanctioned strength of Mizoram Police is around 13,000 personnel, but we have around 9,000 persons at present. They all will be involved in the poll process,"" the DIG said. Mizoram Police is being assisted in its poll-related activities by 40 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF), comprising personnel from BSF, SSB, CRPF and Assam Police. Lalchhuana said special attention has been given along the state's borders with Assam, Manipur and Tripura, while the Mizoram DGP has sought cooperation from his counterparts in these states. ""At four inter-state border points, we are monitoring the movement of people through CCTV. This is a new initiative and we installed it before the poll process started,"" he added. Lalchhuana also praised the public for cooperation in overall peace-keeping efforts during the election campaign across the state. He appreciated the people for depositing their licenced arms as soon as the election notification was announced despite this being the harvest season that typically sees attacks by wild boars on farmers' produce. ""We are repeatedly thanking the people for their cooperation. Mizoram has a track record of holding free and fair polls in the past. I had joined in 1986 and since then, I have witnessed no violence before or after the polling or after declaration of results,"" Lalchhuana said. The ruling Congress and the main opposition party Mizo National Front (MNF) have fielded 40 candidates each, while the BJP is looking to open its account in the state for the first time by contesting in 39 seats. The Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM), an alliance formed by two political parties and four groups, is contesting in 35 seats. Counting of votes will be taken up on 11 December. Ahead of the voting to elect a new Assembly in Congress-ruled Mizoram on Wednesday, the authorities on Tuesday sealed India's borders along the northeastern state with Myanmar and Bangladesh, an official said here on Tuesday. A senior Mizoram Police official said that around 11,100 security personnel comprising central paramilitary and state security forces have been deployed to further tighten the security to foil any attempt to create any trouble during the Wednesday's polling. ""In view of the Assembly polls, BSF and Assam Rifles troopers have been asked to seal Mizoram's borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar and further intensify their vigil along the international frontiers to prevent any kind of cross-border movements by inimical elements,"" Mizoram's Joint Chief Electoral Officer Zorammuana told  . He said: ""Following the directions of the Election Commission, the authorities also asked the security forces to further tighten the security along Mizoram's inter-state borders with Tripura, Assam and Manipur. No movement other than of those associated with the election process would be allowed at the inter-state borders."" Mizoram shares 310-kilometre unfenced borders with Bangladesh and 510-kilometre boundaries with Myanmar without any fencing. The Border Security Force (BSF) troopers have been deployed along the Bangladesh borders, while the Assam Rifles, under the Army, have been posted along at the Myanmar borders. Zorammuana said around 7,075 electoral officials have been engaged to conduct the elections from 7 am to 4 pm Chief Electoral Officer Ashish Kundra said in Aizawl that the electoral officials escorted by security personnel have already reached all the 1,164 polling stations across the state. The Election Commission has set up 15 special polling stations at Kanhmun, a village along the Mizoram-Tripura border, to facilitate voting by Reang tribal refugees, sheltered in Tripura for the past 21 years. Of the over 35,000 tribal immigrants, 11,232 are eligible to cast their votes in the Assembly elections. The CEO said that around 40 all-women managed polling stations have been set up across the constituencies in which the entire polling staff, including the police and security personnel, are women. ""The VVPAT (Voters Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) machines would be used along with EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) in all the 40 constituencies to enhance transparency and credibility of the elections,"" Kundra told the media. Unlike in other states of the country, Church-backed Mizoram People's Forum (MPF) plays a unique role in ensuring free and fair elections in Christian-dominated Mizoram. Started in 2006, it launched an initiative equipped with a mechanism to name and shame any wrongdoing by a candidate or any individual on community loudspeakers for one and all to know. Significantly, the entire exercise is sincerely followed by each member of the deeply religious Mizo society. A total of 209 candidates, 67 higher than in 2013 state polls, are in the fray for the Wednesday's elections to the 40-member Mizoram Assembly. Of the 209 candidates, 15 are women. In 2013, only six women had contested and none were successful. Like the previous elections, women voters once again outnumber the men in Mizoram. Of the 768,181 voters, there are 393,685 women and 374,496 men. The five-year term of the Mizoram Assembly ends on 15 December. Besides two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), many regional and local parties have fielded candidates in most of the 40 Assembly constituencies. They include main opposition Mizo National Front (MNF), People's Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM), Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) and Meghalaya-based National People's Party (NPP). However, the main contest is likely to take place between the ruling Congress and the MNF. The Congress has been in power, except for 10 years, since the Mizoram become a full-fledged state in 1987. The MNF, a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), ruled during those 10 years -- 1998-2003 and 2003-2008. Vote will be counted on 11 December along with four other poll-bound states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Chhattisgarh.",2018-11-28,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,BJP And Congress,Congress,Lal Thanhawla,Madhya Pradesh,Mizoram,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Assembly Elections,Mizoram Assembly Elections Live,Mizoram Assembly Polls,Mizoram Assembly Polls Live,Mizoram Elections,Mizoram Elections Live,Mizoram National Front,Mizoram Polls,Mizoram Polls Live,MNF,NEDA,NewsTracker,NPP,PM Modi,PRISM,Zoram's People's Movement,Zoramthanga,ZPM","Mizoram Assembly elections updates: 56% voter turnout recorded at Tuikum till 2.30 pm, 51% at South tuipui, 59% at Thorang",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-assembly-elections-live-updates-56-voter-turnout-recorded-at-tuikum-till-2-30-pm-51-at-south-tuipui-59-at-thorang-5627861.html,firstpost,-1,0
Team 101Reporters,"Mizoram went to polls on Wednesday with 7.7 lakh names in the electoral rolls, including 3.9 lakh women and 32,545 first-time voters. The overall voter turnout in the state until 6 pm was 73 percent. In 2013, when the turnout was over 83 percent. With 209 candidates in the fray, Mizoram is likely to witness a closely fought battle. While the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Mizo National Front (MNF) have 40 candidates each, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded 39, the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) has 36, and Zoram Thar has 22 candidates vying for a win. The People’s Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM), former Aizawl-based anti-corruption watchdog which launched a political party last year, has fielded 13 candidates. The National People’s Party, which launched its Mizoram unit in late September this year, has nine candidates while the National Congress Party (NCP) has five candidates. Five independents have also thrown their hats in the ring this time. Members and volunteers of the Mizoram People’s Forum (MPF) were spotted on election duty in Mizoram. MPF was founded in Mizoram in 2007 to ensure free and fair elections, says Joe RZ Thanga, an MPF volunteer. The initiative is active only during the elections and is supported by the Young Mizo Association (YMA), which is in turn backed by the Presbyterian Church in Mizoram. The volunteers were seen helping the elderly, the differently-abled and others in need of assistance. Lalthanfela, a differently-abled first-time voter, was casting his vote at Zarkawt-II in Aizawl. Lalthanfela was quite candid about his pick for the government. “I hope the Congress retains power in Mizoram. The focus should be on infrastructure development, improvement of roads and education,” he said. The election day also saw Brus arriving in large numbers from six refugee camps in Tripura to Kanhmun in the Mamit district to cast their votes amid tight security. The total number of Bru voters in the electoral rolls was 12,026, according to the Chief Election Officer (CEO). Fifteen polling booths had been arranged for Bru voters who were coming from Kanchanpur in Tripura. Up until 4 pm, the polling percentage was 52 percent in Kanhmun, as opposed to 11 percent in 2013. Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF) had also demanded setting up of a special polling station in a relief camp area in Kanchanpur in Tripura to help old, pregnant women and differently-abled voters cast their votes. Bruno Msha, the forum’s General Secretary, said that they had communicated their demand to the Election Commission on Tuesday. The Brus and the Mizos have shared a complicated history in the state, with no love lost between the two communities. Sentiments against the minority Chakma community and Bru refugees had flared up once again ahead of the elections. Earlier this month, student associations and civil society groups had demanded the removal of former Chief Election Officer (CEO) SB Shashank for allegedly favouring the Brus and determining how to conduct the elections. Ashish Kundra is the current CEO who replaced SB Shashank. But for some voters, this may just be the deciding factor. Lalrinawma Pachuau from Thentlang Village in the Serchhip district says that he is concerned about the Chakma and the Bru issue more than developmental issues in the state. “I want a government that is strong and capable to safeguard Mizoram from illegal voters and immigrants,” he says. While the issue of ‘illegal immigrants’ is playing on the minds of some voters, there are others who want alcohol prohibition in the state. Lalsiamliana, a voter from Thentlang village, says that he is against the Mizoram Liquor (Prohibition and Control) Act (MLPC) 2014, which permits sale of liquor in the state. “I hope God-fearing people are elected this time to keep a check on alcohol in the state,” he says. The Congress government had lifted the ban on sale of alcohol in 2014, replacing Mizoram Liquor Total Prohibition Act of 1995 with the MLPC Act, 2014. MNF has promised prohibition in the state if voted to power. But Lalsiamliana’s sentiment is not shared by Thasiama from the same village, who says that Congress should come to power for a third term. “I don’t have to worry about drinking spurious alcohol because we are allowed to drink. I want Congress to win,” he says. The key constituencies in the state are Serchhip, Tawi, Aizawl East-I, Aizawl East-II, Palak, Tuichawng, Hachhek, Aizawl West- I & II, Chalfilh. According to political observers in the state, among leaders who stand a good chance of winning are Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla from Serchhip and Champhai South, Zoramthanga (MNF chief) from Aizawl East-I, Lalduhoma (ZPM CM candidate) from Serchhip and Aizawl West-I, JV Hluna (BJP chief) from Tawi, R.Lalzirliana (MNF, former home minister) from Tawi and Hiphei (BJP, former Assembly speaker) from Palak. Lal Thanhawla cast his vote at Zarkawt at around 12.15 pm. He said he is hopeful that Congress would win by bagging more than 27 seats. He also ruled out Congress entering a post-poll alliance with the BJP. Vice-president of BJP’s Mahila Morcha in Mizoram Vijay Lakshmi Rai admitted that chances of BJP winning more than five seats in the state were slim. “The BJP’s campaign was better this year but due to the Hindutva tag attached to the party, we are going to lose in many seats. But the BJP has never won a seat here, so winning even three seats is good for us.” She hinted that the BJP was open to lending support to other “like-minded” parties in forming the government. Woman candidate from Aizawl South-III constituency, Mrs F Lalremsangi, says, ""BJP is a new party in Mizoram and we fought well. Now, if the result doesn't come in our favour, we'll not feel disappointed. If we can reach out to such a large number of people with less than a year, the party will perform far well in the future."" The BJP had six women candidates this time out of a total of 15. Former chief minister of Mizoram Zoramthanga from the MNF cast his vote at Aizawl East-I constituency. Zoramthanga is also the MNF’s candidate from the Aizawl East-I constituency.

Team 101Reporters," Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday reflected the paradoxes that the Hindi heartland lives by. Though voting is conducted electronically, hundreds of electors returned after waiting for hours, when Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) — made by BEL, Bangalore and ECIL, Hyderabad — malfunctioned. After 15 years of one party rule, the state also had entire villages boycotting the election citing a lack of basic amenities. Another significant voter section, Madhya Pradesh’s farmers, made their unhappiness with the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government abundantly clear. Spurts of violence also broke out in Bhind and Mehgaon regions, which was resolved by security personnel. The state recorded 74.61 percent voting till 6 pm, higher than the 72.07 percent voting recorded in 2013 Assembly polls, according to Chief Electoral Officer for Madhya Pradesh VL Kantha Rao, who had to wait for a while due to malfunctioning EVM units before he could cast his vote at the Char Imli VVIP polling booth in Bhopal. Neemuch and Shajapur districts recorded highest voting percentage (81 percent). Three Maoist-affected seats — Baihar, Lanjhi and Paraswada — reported encouraging voter turnout. According to reports, 66 percent turnout was recorded in Baihar, 64 percent in Lanjhi, and 68 percent polling was reported in Paraswada. With heavy security assigned, voting was carried out peacefully in these areas. A total of 1,545 of VVPAT units, 563 Ballot Units and 583 Control Units were replaced till 3 pm, including the 732 VVPAT units, 352 BUs and 369 CUs that had to be replaced during mock polls. In Majesara village of Mandsaur, 856 voters boycotted the elections citing corruption. In Vicharpura village of Shahdol, a lack of water and road infrastructure led voters to call a boycott. Not a single vote was polled in Ruparel village under Sunser Assembly Constituency in Agar Malwa. Villagers were protesting a lack of roads leading to the village. Villagers of Piliyakhal in Harda and Govindgarh and Janakpur in Bhander AC also took the boycott route. They demanded electricity, canals and roads. Water woes kept villagers of Patpara, Tikra Maheshpuri, Khalhe and Maheshpuri Chirapani in Dindori district away from polling booths. Pradeep Singh Bhadauria, polling agent of the Congress candidate in Mehgaon Assembly constituency, was shot and is reportedly seriously injured. According to reports, he was rushed to a hospital in Gwalior. Incidents of violence were also reported from Bhind district, where gunshots were fired in front of two polling booths. Sources said the assailants immediately fled, and the firing was done with the intention of disrupting the poll process. Mehgaon is located in the Gwalior-Chambal region. The region has 34 seats and is a tense contest is expected between the BJP and the Congress. In 2013, the BJP won 20 seats, followed by Congress’ 12. The BSP had managed to win two seats. Madhya Pradesh has the second largest population of Patidars after Gujarat, with nearly 60 lakh voters belonging to the community, of which 40 lakh are from the Malwa region. Of the 230 seats in contention, the fate of around 34 would be predominantly decided by a majority of Patidar voters in these constituencies. Ambalal Patidar and Gopal Patidar, farmers in Mandsaur, blame the present dispensation for the problems farmers face. They hold the government responsible for the police brutality on protesting farmers last year in Mandsaur, and state that they want to “overthrow” the government. Also on Wednesday, four polling officials passed away due to cardiac arrest while on Election Commission duty. The EC announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the kin of three EC officials: one from Guna and two from Indore. The fourth official passed away in Dhar district.",2018-11-29,"Betul,Bhopal,Char Imli,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Election Commission,EVM,Harda,Indore,Kamal Nath,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Polls,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Elections,Mandla,Satna,VVPATs",MP election 2018: High turnout in Assembly polls amid EVM snags perfectly captures paradox of Hindi heartland,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/high-turnout-in-madhya-pradesh-assembly-polls-amid-evm-snags-perfectly-captures-paradox-of-hindi-heartland-5634731.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,"A right-wing group in Rajasthan has sent a legal notice to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath asking him to apologise within three days for allegedly calling Lord Hanuman a Dalit. During a poll rally in Malakheda of Alwar district on Tuesday, Adityanath had said, ""Hanuman was a forest dweller, deprived and a Dalit. Bajrang Bali worked to connect all Indian communities together, from north to south and east to west"". ""This was his resolve as it was Lord Rama's wish. Just like him, we should also not rest till we fulfil that wish,"" he added. He also said that the people of the district would vote for 'Ram bhakts' and not 'Ravana'. Rajasthan Sarv Brahmin Mahasabha president Suresh Mishra has now sent a notice to Adityanath, accusing him of dragging Lord Hanuman's caste for political gain for the BJP in the state where Assembly polls will be held on 7 December. The notice reads, ""I am saddened that Uttar Pradesh chief minister called Lord Hanuman deprived. His statement has hurt religious sentiments of several devotees. Those who are deprived they get strength to fight the odds. It is a sheer attempt to take political mileage in election"". Adityanath's comments have triggered a political row prompting the Congress to blame the BJP for its ""dual face"". Congress leader Pramod Tiwari condemned the Adityanath's remarks, saying the BJP divides individual and the society but it is for the first time that it has divided gods into castes.

FP Staff,"Are state governors in India mere political pawns? Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik's recent   out of the Raj Bhawan for dissolving the state Assembly appears to indicate just that. Malik had said he was not sure when will he be transferred from Jammu and Kashmir, but the ""threat of a transfer is there"". Although he is not the first governor (and likely not the last) to have found himself in the middle of a political controversy, but his statement has revived   and if at all it's possible for the constitutional head of a state to act without fear and favour and without being influenced by the powers that be. Earlier, Malik had implied that the Centre had wanted him to   to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir. Lone, whose party had only two seats in the Assembly, reportedly has the support of BJP legislators as well as some rebel MLAs of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). But he was not the only one staking claim to form the state government. PDP chief and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had also said she had sent a letter to Malik, claiming that her party has the support of the required number of MLAs — backed by Omar Abdullah's National Conference and the Congress — to form government in the conflict-torn state. Malik, however, had rejected both claims and dissolved the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, forcing fresh elections in the state in the next six months. His decision received a sharp reaction, with most critics accusing the governor of   and not giving Mufti a chance to form the government in the state. While Mufti and her supports claim that Malik had acted in an ""unconstitutional"" manner because BJP-backed Lone didn't have the numbers, it is also believed that the NC-Congress-PDP alliance caught the Centre off guard, and since it didn't want Mufti back in office, dissolving the Assembly eventually served the BJP well. The Jammu and Kashmir governor also claimed that he dissolved the Assembly because Mufti was never interested in forming the government and wanted fresh polls. He said the alliance would not be stable for the state, even though it is not his job to test the future stability of the government nor is he qualified to make such as judgement. Malik's actions and his revelations from earlier this week have shown that the position of a governor can easily be compromised to serve the Centre's political interests, though he said he was not afraid of a backlash from those who had installed him in the Raj Bhawan in the first place. But can all claim to act without personal prejudice and in favour of the state? The spats between the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi and the Lieutenant-Governor is well documented. Similar issues have also been witnessed in Puducherry, where the chief minister of the Union Territory is locked in a bitter battle over powers with L-G Kiran Bedi. While much of these power tussles have been about the authorities themselves, history in states shows a completely different ball game. In 2016, Arunachal Pradesh governor JP Rajkhowa had triggered a constitutional crisis in the notheastern state by unlawfully advancing the Assembly session, which had led to the imposition of President’s Rule in the state. In Tamil Nadu, then governor C Vidyasagar Rao was often accused of not performing his constitutional duties and for allowing the   that followed former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's death, the subsequent arrest of her aide Sasikala and the split in the AIADMK to get out of hand. In an ideal situation, a governor is supposed to be anything but a political pawn. The qualities and qualifications for a governor listed out by the Sarkaria Commission say: ""The governor should be eminent in some walk of life and from outside the state. He should be a detached figure without intense political links or should not have taken part in politics in the recent past. Besides, he should not be a member of the ruling party."" But these rules are hardly followed anymore in choosing a governor. Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala was a member of the BJP and is a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In fact, Vala had even vacated his seat for Modi. That intense political links are still present became apparent when Vala had called on Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa to form the state government even though he lacked majority support in the Assembly. Although a governor is the Centre's representative at the state level, according to Article 159 of the Constitution which lists out the oath of the governor, s/he should ""devote himself to the service and well being of the people of state"". A governor must work towards the benefit of the people of the state, not towards a party, an ideology or association, or a government. More often than not, governors have done the latter, be it the UPA or NDA at the Centre. This then pleads a question — was Malik thinking about the people of Jammu and Kashmir when he dissolved the Assembly? Did he have them in mind when he said he fears he might get transferred for not having listened to the Centre's diktat?",2018-11-28,"BJP,Congress,Governor's Role,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly,Jammu And Kashmir Governor,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,PDP,PoliticsDecoder,Sajad Lone,Satya Pal Malik","J&K governor Satya Pal Malik's revelations reiterate vulnerability of state heads, indicate their difficulty in rejecting central power play",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-governor-satya-pal-maliks-revelations-reiterate-vulnerability-of-state-heads-indicate-their-difficulty-in-rejecting-central-power-play-5632651.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ajay Singh,"On my trip from Indore to Bhopal, I was given an eye-opening lesson in sociology and politics by Roop Singh, the driver of my hired Innova. What he told me was so nuanced and deep that it made me not only understand the current election in a new light, but also helped me figure out why touring journalists seldom read polls right. The general wisdom among political pundits is that this time around, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is on a sticky wicket because of, among various other reasons, the fact that BJP's traditional upper caste support base is upset. Word is they are angry with Chouhan for his alleged bias towards Dalits and OBCs. So, I lobbed the question to Roop. Pat came his answer: “You see, sir, upper castes are like frogs on a   (weighing scale). They jump from one scale to the other habitually just to disturb the scale.” He was using a modified   (adage) which talks about the impossibility of weighing frogs on a scale and felt the need to explain it. “I do not know to which caste you belong,” he said.  “I am a Thakur and assuming that you are also a Thakur. But what is common between you and me?” What he left unsaid was: ""Then why do you expect me to vote like you?"" He was right. Even if I were a Thakur, I'm not, there would be nothing even remotely common between the two of us. Using a simple adage, he was educating me on why urban India should not treat caste as a homogenous group: one that eats, lives, behaves and votes as one. In an urban, each-one-to-their-own milieu, class divisions obfuscate and even override caste similarities. In his view, a section of the rich upper castes, guided by the frog-in-the-balance-syndrome, was trying to disturb the political scale for their self-interests. “Contrast this with the behaviour of Muslims, and you will find them sitting tight on one of the scales,” he added. Roop is a BJP supporter. But what was significant in his formulation was the underlying theme of communal division. Given the presence of the BJP’s robust organisational structure in the state, Hindutva seems to have permeated deeply into the state’s body politic. It is not without reason that even top Congress leaders are running from Datia Pitambara Peeth to the Mahakal temple in Ujjain to seek divine blessings. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi led this show to establish the party’s pro-Hindu credentials. But that seems not only too little too late, but also an obsolete idea. In the past, the Congress was for long regarded as more pro-Hindu than the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS). This was all the more true when Dwarka Prasad Mishra was chief minister from 1963 to 1967. Even during Indira Gandhi’s time, the party was never regarded with the slightest bit of suspicion by Hindus, though the RSS-BJS had a strong presence in the state. This situation reversed only during Digvijaya Singh’s second stint (1998 to 2003) when he embraced a brand of secularism which was projected as a tactic of minority appeasement. What compounded the Congress’ folly was its reliance on the premise that the socially-marginalised groups would not join the Hindutva fold, which was largely perceived as pro-upper castes. Digvijaya successfully stalled the BJP’s march in 1998 on account of his pro-poor approach that roped in the socially-marginalised sections to the Congress’ fold. However, his over-reliance on this strategy proved counter-productive in 2003 when “bijli, sadak and paani (electricity, road and water)” became the reigning slogan for the people. Though the BJP projected Uma Bharti as its chief ministerial candidate, it did not harp on Hindutva. It promised basic amenities to lure in voters. Since then, the Congress has been unable to find its feet on the state's electoral ground. And it is unlikely the Congress can do so this time either, despite a propitious political circumstance. The reason is not far to seek. The state government has been recklessly overindulgent on social spending to mitigate rural distress. Take, for example, the Rs 600 crore worth purchase of onions to assuage farmers’ plight. Or the introduction of Bhavantar scheme under which farmers are directly paid the difference between the minimum support price (MSP) and the actual market price, in case the latter is higher. In many of these schemes, there is a huge potential for irregularities. Yet, spending has invariably benefitted local traders and farmers and substantially mitigated the anger against the government. At the same time, rapid urbanisation and expansion of the irrigation network has brought prosperity and lifted a substantial section of the poor above the distress level. This improvement in the economic profile has resulted in a sea change in the state's social complexion. Even the upper castes that migrated to urban areas in search of jobs are more aligned to class division than caste allegiance. That is what Roop explained so beautifully in his own way. That does not mean that Chouhan will have a cake walk. He is certainly encumbered by indiscretions of his own government; in the Vyapam scam, and other scams in social welfare spending, giving free rein to mining mafias and others. Add to that the unbridled hubris of BJP’s local cadre and leaders. But what makes his task a bit easier is the clear distinction between the BJP and the Congress: while the former is firing on all cylinders to win, the latter is awaiting a windfall.",2018-11-29,"Betul,Bhopal,Char Imli,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Election Commission,EVM,Harda,Indore,InMyOpinion,Kamal Nath,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Polls,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Elections,Mandla,Satna,VVPATs","Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls: Of frogs, scales and why (upper) caste equations may not worry Shivraj Singh Chouhan",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-assembly-election-of-frogs-scales-and-why-upper-caste-equations-may-not-worry-shivraj-singh-chouhan-5634961.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"It was only three months ago, on 21 August to be precise, that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised the nation by appointing Satya Pal Malik as governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Privately, many in the ruling BJP asked one question: “Why him?” But then all such discussions ended with the belief — and hope — that it must have been decided after due deliberations at the highest level for the greater good. Three months later, Governor Malik has been pulling off one surprise after another. He has been talking non-stop. All he needs is an audience: either directly, on the phone or the mike of a TV channel. His latest outburst is the most interesting: claiming he is now faced with the ""threat of transfer"" by the ruling dispensation, which over 90 days ago, thought it prudent to give him command of this critical state. However, Malik still thinks that he wouldn’t or couldn’t be removed, that he will continue to enjoy position and perks of a being governor at a different Raj Bhawan, perhaps at a less scenic and less important state. Speaking at an event in Jammu Tuesday, Malik said: ""As long as I'm here — it's not in my hands — I don't know when I will be transferred. I will not lose my job, but the threat of transfer is there. As long as I'm here, I assure you people that whenever you call me, I will come here to pay tribute."" Malik is in the eye of a political storm, not because he dissolved the Jammu and Kashmir Vidhan Sabha at 9 pm on 21 November, a holiday on account of Eid Milad ul-Nabi, the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, but because what he said in an interaction in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh  ""Had I looked towards Delhi (the Centre), I would have been compelled to invite Sajad Lone to form the government,"" Malik said. ""Then I would have gone down in history as unscrupulous. But I ended the whole thing. Those who want to abuse me can do so, but I am convinced I did the right thing."" The facts of the case remain unknown. Who spoke to whom, who said what and what he wanted to say. But surely governance and decision-making on subjects as sensitive and critical as formation of an alternative government in a House under suspended animation or its dissolution is complicated and confidential to the core among participants, also filtered at various levels. Malik is wittingly or unwittingly letting out things that are making the situation extremely difficult for the BJP, the Modi government and Lone. Malik's statement embarrassed the government. Malik, 72, has been in political life long enough to understand the implications of the statements he's made these past few days. Since last Wednesday evening, Malik has been all over the media: print, TV and digital. He has been speaking at length to try to justify why he dissolved the Assembly. And while Malik was hogging the headlines, there was concern in New Delhi's corridors of power that Malik was talking too much and to too many people. Malik has now proved those concerns were not without merit. Malik, a late entrant to the BJP, is not used to the ruling party's “discipline”. Apparently, the socialist in him is still alive: speak first and think about the consequences later. The turn of events suggest that Malik was trying to keep around him a halo, portraying himself as a righteous man defying his political bosses and employer to protect the dignity of his post. Malik may not have had any staff at Raj Bhawan to serve him food or to attend the fax machine when most urgent and important letters were sent by a former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister because it was a holiday. But a social media alert made him work overtime — in the loneliness and solitude of his majestic residence — and inspired him to work in the best interests of the state and the nation and abruptly dissolve the Assembly over two years ahead of schedule. Malik was attempting to let the public know that he didn't care whether he had any staff to assist in this most defining task of his governorship. He also didn't care whether he landed from Delhi only hours ago, was tired and it was time for him to relax, but the call of duty told him that he must act and act fast, sign the Assembly dissolution order and have it released to the world. If Malik is removed or transferred now, as he fears, fingers would be pointed at the Centre. Malik has played his card. It’s now Centre’s turn. Malik knows a governor’s term is five years, but as per provisions of the Constitution, he holds his office “at the pleasure of the president”. Malik's continued tenure may no longer please President Ram Nath Kovind. What perhaps gives Malik confidence of holding his seat is his social roots. Malik is a Jat from Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat. Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP would not like to get on the bad side of the Jat community, given its penchant for reacting emotionally.",2018-11-28,"BJP,Fax Machine,InMyOpinion,J&K Assembly,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Governor,Jammu And Kashmir People's Conference,Kashmir Chief Minister,Mehbooba Mufti,NC,Omar Abdullah,PDP,People's Conference,Raj Bhawan,Sajjad Lone,Satya Pal Malik,TheySaidIt","Facing 'threat of transfer', J&K governor Satya Pal Malik takes his case to public, banks on Jat roots to keep BJP onside",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/facing-threat-of-transfer-jk-governor-satya-pal-malik-takes-his-case-to-public-banks-on-jat-roots-to-keep-bjp-onside-5632611.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rashme Sehgal,"People’s Conference chairman Sajad Lone belongs to new generation of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir. Lone was confident that although he had only two seats in the Assembly, he could have won over disgruntled elements from the Peoples Democratic Party to achieve his ambition and become chief minister. This, he believed, would have come his way: apart from of course enjoying the support of the BJP MLAs. Fearing this would result in horse-trading, Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik put paid to Lone's ambitions and dissolved the Assembly. Malik claimed he took such a step because he did not want to go down in history as 'unscrupulous'. Lone, in an interview, talks about his struggles in politics, taking on the 'dynasties' in the Valley and Governor Malik. I don’t know. The governor should answer that question. But he's presenting a new version every day. Today, he's come up with yet another version. To set the record straight, on that particular day, ( 21 November),  I spoke to him on the phone and conveyed I wanted to stake a claim to form the government. He told me to send a fax. I tried, but did not succeed. I called his secretary, who said he was putting me through, but the governor did not take my call. This went on for three hours. We could not get through to any of the Raj Bhawan numbers. Finally, I sent my letter on WhatsApp. An hour-and-a-half later, Mehbooba Mufti’s letter staking a claim to form the government popped up on Twitter. Someone must have passed on the information that we were staking a claim, which is why she put up her letter on Twitter. I was going to stake a claim within the ambit of the Constitution. I would not do something outside its ambit. If I didn't have the numbers, I would not have been allowed to form the government. After all, an anti-defection law is in place. I'm not mad. A huge group within PDP approached me. They wanted to join me, I did not go to them. He was not involved, but there were many others. When these three parties — National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and Congress — were coming together to stake a claim, did they consult their legislators? They did not. The days of herding your legislators are in the past. There is decision-making at the macro levels and decision-making at the micro level. But legislators are not being taken into confidence at the micro level. Unfortunately, these parties did not involve them at the micro level and this led many MLAs to gravitate towards me. I had the support of the BJP and would have raised required numbers. How can this be called horse-trading ? The governor should be more careful about what he is saying. He (governor) should know when to keep his mouth shut. But the governor is going against me hammer and tongs. Does the governor want to get me finished? There are violent elements across the Valley and we have to be careful about what we say. The misrepresentation of facts is also going on in the media and this vilification campaign needs to end. Kashmir has a long history of unfortunate incidents. Everyone knows what happened at the polls in 1987. Elections have been blatantly rigged. This is nothing new: be it the National Conference or the Congress. Look how these parties rigged the 1987 elections. As a result, more than 1 lakh people have died in the Valley. The 2002 elections, when the PDP managed to get 15 MLAs, were no better. And 1996, when Farooq Abdullah came to power, was no election, but a selection done with the connivance of the Centre. This time around, those belonging to  dynastic politics ganged up against me. Both dynasties, Mufti and Abdullah, were in cahoots to keep me out. Sometimes, I get the impression that the governor is acting at the behest of these parties. I regret to say that he (governor) is the setting sun whereas my career in politics is on the ascendancy. I am not part of any dynasty. I have been struggling for the past sixteen years. Everyone knows the circumstances under which my father was killed. The next day, I was appointed chairman of the People’s Conference. One year later, I was kicked out by Hurriyat separatists. Both Mehbooba and Omar Abdullah have been groomed by their fathers and all the uncles and aunties they know in Delhi. They have a great network. I've had to learn from my mistakes. They don’t want any challenge, and I have shown the courage to challenge them. When Mehbooba tied up with the BJP, it was alright but when I make a similar attempt, we are labelled 'RSS'. When they tie up with the BJP, then it is alright. They don't want to see a ""commoner"" as chief minister. No. This is the crux of the matter.  I went to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union ministers after they won the 2014 elections and they (Mehbooba and Omar) found this unacceptable. Why should someone else create his own sphere? No doubt, they had their fathers to help them. They have been at the helm for most of the time. The tipping point was 1987 and for the last 30 years, our state has not been able to come out of this vortex of violence. This is not to say this violence will not end. It will happen, but there can be no short-term solutions. Assuming there are apprehensions, all political parties have been with them (BJP) at one time or another. Mehbooba was with them for three years.

Press Trust of India,"Exuding confidence that the grand alliance or   will form the next government in Telangana, Telegu Desam Party's (TDP) state chief L Ramana has alleged K Chandrashekar Rao used the opportunity as the first chief minister to benefit his family and the mega tie-up of Opposition parties has been formed to save people from his ""dictatorship rule"". In an interview to  , Ramana said that KCR, as the state's first chief minister is popularly known as, has failed on many fronts despite spending Rs 8 lakh crore and borrowing Rs 2.2 lakh crore. ""The alliance was formed to save people from the dictatorship rule of KCR. People elected TRS in 2014, but the opportunity given to KCR was used for the benefit of his family. The dictator's rule is not good for welfare of Telangana. Therefore, four parties have come together,"" he said. KCR is seeking a second term as chief minister after dissolving the Assembly in September. KCR's party Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is fighting in all seats, while TDP (Telugu Desam Party) has joined hands with Congress, CPI and TJS to form a grand alliance. When asked why TDP joined hands with the Congress in spite of bitter rivalry in the past, Ramana said, ""There has been a change in Congress now. The party has changed its earlier ways of working and attitude and therefore it made PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh as prime ministers."" He added, ""In the event of changes seen in the Congress, we have allied with the Congress to form  , the grand alliance that comprises two other parties Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) and Communist Party of India (CPI)."" On TDP being portrayed as an ""anti-Telangana"" party, Ramana said, ""The NTR Bhavan at the centre of the city (Hyderabad) is an example of where TDP's roots lie. The then TDP government created the Cyberabad region and boosted the service sector, the fruits of which are still available. Our base is here."" Claiming that the BJP has a secret pact with KCR and also has friendly ties with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, Ramana said, ""Presently, about 4 crore people of Telangana are feeling as if they are captive. We want to free them by throwing TRS out of power."" Ramana said his party's main focus in Telangana would be to increase opportunities to improve the revenue and make a surplus budget state. The TDP won 15 seats in the 2014 state elections, not 12 of them had defected to the ruling TRS. ""I believe one should live in whatsoever situation comes. We need to have faith and be loyal. Our effort is to strengthen the faith and stay united. We remained strong and undeterred when TRS took away our MLAs and MLCs between 2014 and 2015,"" Ramana said.

Sreemoy Talukdar,"In 2006, Rahul Gandhi, then a newbie in politics, announced at the Congress plenary session that he follows two religions —  . Twelve years is a long time in politics. The Gandhi scion is now the Congress president, busy shedding his 'secular' credentials. Rahul flaunts his ' ' (sacred thread), pitches a journey to Kailash Mansarovar as the high point of his ' ', criss-crosses between temples across India during elections, sports a 'tilak' on his forehead and tells the head   (caste). Once the self-anointed custodian of 'secular' politics, the Congress is now desperate to be rebranded as a 'Hindu party'. 'Secularism' has travelled a long way in India. The ongoing election season reinforces the death of 'secularist' politics. While Assembly elections will be held in five states this year, the big one is next year, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek to extend his mandate. Amid this dance of democracy, the absolute silence of Muslim voices points to a decisive shift in identity politics. Muslims, who were   in India till 2014, suddenly find themselves sidelined, marginalised and even forgotten. In a   that has since gone viral, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath was recently heard telling Muslim leaders that if the Congress does not get 90 percent of the total Muslim votes in the state, the party will ""suffer a big loss"". There's nothing wrong with the pitch, but the fact that the comments were made at a private, closed-door meeting, where Nath also pleaded with leaders from the community that ""you will have to bear everything till the day of voting"" and ""we will deal with them (RSS and BJP) later"", indicates that the Congress is now scared of the 'pro-Muslim' tag that was ironically its  . In a report,   quotes a Congress leader as saying that the party believes that being sympathetic to Muslim causes has ""harmed its electoral prospects"". This shift from a 'pro-Muslim' stance — as the AK Antony Committee had pointed out after the 2014 drubbing — to a 'pro-Hindutva' approach is not a preserve of the Congress. In West Bengal, for instance, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee underwent a similar trajectory. At one point, she was busy burnishing her 'secular' credentials by announcing a  , or imposing restrictions on Durga Puja immersions, for which she was admonished by the Calcutta High Court. The court had observed in 2016 that the state government ""has been irresponsibly brazen in its conduct of  , thereby infringing upon the fundamental rights of people worshipping Maa Durga"". However, in recent years, Mamata has been busy  , greeting the nation on Hanuman Jayanti or   and power bill relief for Durga Puja organisers in the state. A part of this shift has undoubtedly happened due to the rise of the BJP as the dominant force in national politics, but the crucial bit about the saffron party's ascendancy has been the way it has forced a shift in mainstream political discourse from 'secularism' to 'Hindutva', so much so that other parties are being forced to play by its rules. The Congress initially tried to solve this problem by driving a difference between 'Hinduism' and 'Hindutva', but it lacks the ideological conviction and political capital to communicate that strategy. Consequently, a desperate Congress shed all 'secularist' pretenses and embarked on an aggressive brand of Hindutva politics to beat the BJP in its own game — almost as if to show that the BJP is a 'pseudo-Hindutva' party just as the Congress is a 'pseudo-secular' one. Accordingly, All India Congress Committee general secretary and senior Congress leader in poll-bound Rajasthan, CP Joshi, was heard telling participants at a rally in Nathdwara that  , not Modi or Uma Bharti (who belong to a lower caste), in a constituency that has a sizeable portion of Brahmin representation. Joshi was apparently ""chided"" by the party president, but soon after, Rahul's ' ' was leaked to the media, where his Brahmin credentials were reinforced to go with his   appearance. After all, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala did claim that his party has "" "". Meanwhile, the   vows to build the route taken by Lord Ram in his exile, cow shelters in every panchayat, commercial production of cow urine, opening of a spiritual department and developing the Narmada Parikrama, while senior Congress leaders are seen   in their hands during news conferences. This comical, competitive Hindutva seems to be a tactical attempt to reclaim the ground that Congress assumes it has lost to the BJP. The fact that it feels it will be in a better place to do so by revamping itself as a 'Hindutva' party,   instead of reinforcing its 'secular' credentials, speaks of the quiet death of 'secularism' as a driving force in Indian politics. This isn't a surprise because the Congress-championed 'secularism' — a model that was followed by all 'secular' parties — had long collapsed under the weight of its contradictions. Instead of an ideological anchor, it degenerated into a rent-seeking exercise. As Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav writes in  , ""Unlike other castes and communities, you don't need to offer education, jobs,  ,  ,   to secure Muslim votes. Just keep them insecure and keep offering them security. Muslims were perfect political hostage to 'secular' politics. Anything that pandered to Muslim 'sentiment' as defined by its leadership was kosher, as secular politics was seen to be pro-minority. Any party opposed to the BJP could call itself secular."" This tactic may have brought electoral dividends to 'secular parties', but it was a game of diminishing returns, which also kept Muslims out of the development route and fuelled anti-minority consolidation among Hindus for the BJP to exploit. This tactic has come full circle as the Gandhi scion now has to bare his   to convince Hindus that he, too, is a Hindu. For the BJP, this presents an opportunity to replace the discredited concept of 'secularism"" and cement Hindutva as the new normal — an inclusive, ideological agenda that RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat speaks of — which isn't complete without Muslims and celebrates diversity rather than feeling threatened by it. That may free Muslims from the bondage of rent-seeking 'secularism' and lead to true empowerment.",2018-11-27,"BJP,Congress,Hindu-Muslim,Hindutva Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rahul Gandhi Gotra,Secular Politics,Secularism,Secularism In India","Silence of the Muslims: Congress' Hindutva shows death of 'secularism', gives BJP chance to set new inclusive agenda",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/silence-of-the-muslims-congress-hindutva-shows-death-of-secularism-gives-bjp-chance-to-set-new-inclusive-agenda-5625961.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The Maharashtra government will table in the state Assembly the 'action taken report' (ATR) on the State Backward Class Commission's recommendations for Maratha quota, before introducing a bill to make a provision for the reservation, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Tuesday. The government is committed to providing quota to the Maratha community in jobs and education, he asserted while speaking in the Assembly. As per rules under which the State Backward Class Commission has been set up, only the ATR on its recommendations is tabled in the House, he said. This is the 52nd report of the commission and the earlier 51 reports were not tabled in the Legislature, he added. ""My government is committed to providing reservation to the Maratha community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Community (SEBC) category over and above the existing 52 percent reservation in the state,"" Fadnavis said. He alleged that the Opposition's intention in seeking the commission's report to be made public was to create ""division"" among communities in society. He said the report of Tata Institute of social sciences (TISS) on reservation to the Dhangar (shepherd) reservation was being studied. ""We will also table the ATR of this report. The reservations of the Scheduled Tribes (STs) will be protected. The recommendations of the TISS report will be sent to the Centre and reservation would be given without hurting the existing quota for STs,"" he said. Criticising the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over the issue of quota for Muslims, Fadnavis accused them of trying to mislead the minority community. ""52 backward castes among Muslims were given reservation by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP state government (in 90s). To give reservation, the castes need to be declared as backward first. Those demanding quota should first approach the State Backward Class Commission, and the commission's report will be binding on the government,"" he said. ""Our government is providing educational benefits to the backward communities among Muslims. For Congress and NCP, Muslims are just a vote bank and they never cared for their well-being,"" he charged. Accusing the opposition of indulging in politics, Fadnavis said he can give a political response to such acts. The Opposition members objected to the chief minister's reply and the House had to be adjourned for 10 minutes amid uproarious scenes. Notably, Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil, who heads the Cabinet sub-committee on the Maratha quota issue, had told reporters on Monday that the government will introduce a bill on Thursday to provide reservation to Marathas under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) category before the end of the Legislature's winter session. The state Legislature's winter session concludes on Friday. After the House reassembled, Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil accused the chief minister of misleading the House. The Opposition members squatted in the well of the House and shouted slogans in support of their demand that reports recommending quotas for Maratha and Dhangars be tabled in the Legislature and five percent reservation in education to Muslims be restored. Vikhe Patil said the earlier 51 reports of the State Backward Class Commission were not tabled in the Legislature since no demand was made for it. Amid the din, some supplementary demands and nine bills, including amendment to the APMC Act and the GST Act, were passed by voice vote. Earlier, when the House reassembled at 12.15 pm after the first two adjournments, Vikhe Patil demanded tabling of reports recommending reservation for the Maratha and Dhangar communities and restoring quota for Muslims in education. ""Fadnavis has asked people to rejoice on 1 December. We need to know the recommendations and what is mentioned in the report. Why is the government's stand ambiguous? This is an insult to the Maratha community,"" he said. NCP leader Ajit Pawar said people want to know what is mentioned in the commission's report. The situation prevailing now is different from when the previous 51 reports of the Backward Class Commission were prepared, he said. The Opposition members later staged a walkout and the House took up a discussion on the drought situation in the state. The Maratha community, which constitutes over 30 percent of the state's population, has been demanding quota for a long time and its agitation for the same in July and August this year had taken a violent turn.",2018-11-27,"Chandrakant Patil,Devendra Fadnavis,Maharashtra Assembly,Maratha Quota,NewsTracker,State Backward Class Commission","Devendra Fadnavis says Maharashtra govt committed to giving quotas to Maratha community in jobs, education",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/devendra-fadnavis-says-maharashtra-govt-committed-to-giving-quotas-to-maratha-community-in-jobs-education-5625661.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sandipan Sharma,"The defining linguistic feature of a Marwari — people born in areas around Jodhpur — is his complete reluctance to say the Hindi alphabet   and  . For reasons that are both hilarious and serious, a Jodhpuri would always replace   with a  . So, if you hear a Jodhpuri accusing of speaking   (lie), don’t be under the illusion that you have resorted to half-truths. What you are guilty of is actually speaking     (clear lie). Similary,   (truth) becomes  ,   (needle) becomes  (betel nut) becomes . Go back further down in history and some linguists in Jodhpur would even trace the origin of the word Hindu in this linguistic variation — a himple, err simple, substitution of the S in Sindhu by the sound H. But, that’s a different debate. In adjoining Jalore, also part of Marwar,   and   becomes  and, funnily,   becomes   or   And with this primer on the Marwari phonetics, let’s come to the point, which is the ongoing election for the Assembly in Rajasthan. In Jalore, most people will tell you that there is very little chance of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, or if we were to keep in mind the Marwari linguistic feature, Vachundhra Raje, returning to power. They argue, this year the fight is between Achok Gehlot (Congress leader Ashok Gehlot) and Chashin Pilot (Sachin Pilot). The reason, as a woman asked Raje point blank at an election rally, is clear: Educated youth are sitting at home. They do not have jobs or employment. “ ? (Why should we vote?)” Also, they argue, farmers (  in Jalore) are on the verge of ruin because of low yields and falling prices of crops. The Congress has got its finger on Marwar’s painful nerve. At a rally in Pokhran on Monday, Rahul Gandhi addressed both these issues when he promised to waive off loans to farmers and guaranteed that the next chief minister of Rajasthan will work 18 hours a day just to ensure the youth get jobs. From their linguistic preferences, you can infer Jodhpuris are lazy (some argue they replace   with   because uttering the former alphabet requires more effort or the labour of spitting out the   they have stuffed in their oral cavity) as well as pragmatic. Notice that they use an H in place of S only when the word starts with that alphabet. If an S or Sh appears in the middle or at the end, they leave it untouched. So, unlike in Jalore, Vasundhara doesn’t become Vahundhara in Jodhpur and Ashok doesn’t become Ahok, but Sachin morphs into Hachin. (Legend has it that when India once played a one-dayer at the Barkatullah Stadium here, the stands echoed with the quasi-familiar chant of ‘Hachin, Hachin.’) So, in this election, the Jodhpuri voter is taking both the easy way out and being pragmatic. The easier route is reflected in their preference for the BJP on seats where the Congress has put up Muslim candidates, especially in Jodhpur’s Soorsagar. Here, before the election began, the consensus was the BJP candidate Suryakanta Vyas was on her way out. Vyas, interestingly, is almost 75 years old and should have by now earned appellations like aunty or granny, but, for some reason, is still called   (elder sister). The Congress has revived  ’s chances by fielding a local mathematics professor Dr Ayub Khan. Unfortunately, the caste and community arithmetic doesn’t seem to favour him. The Jodhpuri’s pragmatism is evident in the steadfast loyalty to Gehlot, who wins every election by the simple expedient of announcing his candidature from the city’s Hardarpura (Sardarpura) constituency. Voters know that even if all of Congress were to be decimated, they would still have a powerful man representing them in the Assembly. So, whatever by the nature of the poll — Modi wave, anti-incumbency, Ram Mandir — Gehlot is certain to win by a huge margin. Jodhpuris love sweets,   and   (green chilly)  . Many of them start their day with spicy hot snacks that an average Indian would eat only at the risk of summoning the fire brigade to douse the fire that erupts from every pore. The election in the region, in accordance with the gastronomic taste, is also not bland. The Congress believes it has the edge because of rising anti-incumbency and the presence of Gehlot, one of the frontrunners for the top job. But the old-school ticket distribution by the party — three Muslims, four Jats, three Rajputs, four SC — has shifted the debate from Raje’s tenure to caste equations. And since the outcome now depends on local factors, the BJP is back in the race. Also, Gehlot as a frontrunner, is a bit of a double-edged sword. While some communities support him blindly, there are others who oppose him with equal vigour. In the end, this love-hate relationship with Gehlot generally balances the gains and losses. Once upon a time, Jats of Marwar believed their stalwart leader, the late Parasram Maderna, would become the chief minister. But Maderna was pipped by Gehlot and the Jats still hold it against him. But this year, the presence of Pilot in the fray — he spoke just before Rahul Gandhi at Pokhran and thus occupied the higher position in public perception in the Congress pecking order — may bring Jats who don’t want Gehlot as chief minister back to the Congress fold. But the BJP too is going out of its way to retain Jat voters. Since the situation is fluid, there is no point asking a Marwari:   (tell honestly), who could be the next chief minister? You are unlikely to get a   picture.",2018-11-27,"Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,India,PoliticalPlay,Politics,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha Election: Jodhpuri voter will take pragmatic approach in choosing between BJP, Congress",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-vidhan-sabha-election-jodhpuri-voter-will-take-pragmatic-approach-in-choosing-between-bjp-congress-5626691.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Mocking Rahul Gandhi's poll promise to waive farmers' loans within 10 days of the Congress being voted to power in Rajasthan, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Tuesday said the party is resorting to such slogans as it knows it is not going to come to power. Jaitley said they had made this promise both in Karnataka and Punjab, but reduced the waiving of loans to a ""make-believe formality"", when they found that they cannot do it in Punjab. The Union finance minister was apparently referring to the partial waiving of farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh, taken from cooperative banks only. But waiving the loans even partially resulted in a huge shortfall of funds for developments, he said. “Those, who do not have the knowledge of a subject, tend to seek cheap publicity. It needs vision, and not slogans, to run the country,"" he said. It has become a trend to give slogans to hide ignorance, said Jaitley, adding the slogan-giving custom was started in 1971 with 'Garibi Hatao' but the country is still grappling with the problem. The time of politics through sloganeering is over now as people's expectations from political leaders are high, he added. In an election campaign rally in Jaisalmer district Monday, Rahul had said, “You are going to make the Congress party's government in the state. Within ten days of the government's formation, the Congress will waive farmers' loans in the state.” Rahul said he had made the same promise during Punjab and Karnataka elections and the Congress governments there have waived farmers' loan. Jaitley also hit out at the Congress over making unemployment an election issue, saying it was the Congress which created the problem during 50 years of their rule in the country. “Those who created the problem of unemployment are making it an issue today. Has the unemployment been there only for the last two years?” Jaitley asked. The Union finance minister said the people across the world used to mock at India for 40 years for its two to three percent growth rate. It is for the first time that India has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Talking about the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and demonitisation, Jaitley said it was an achievement of the government that it could bring 334 commodities under 12 and 18 percent tax ambit after implementation of GST. “VAT and excise collectively had cascading effect and the tax rate was 31 percent. The BJP government brought 334 commodities under 12 and 18 percent slab. Those who looted 31 percent as tax were 'Gabbar' or those who reduced the tax slab?” he asked. The Union minister said only 3.8 crore people used to file tax returns when the BJP came to power in the country. After four years of the BJP rule, the tax base has almost doubled. “After four years of the BJP rule, 6.86 crore people have started filing tax returns and we hope it would touch 7.6 crore mark by next year,” he said.",2018-11-27,"Arun Jaitley,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,TheySaidIt",Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha polls: Arun Jaitley says Congress promising loan waiver as it knows it won't come to power,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-vidhan-sabha-polls-arun-jaitley-says-congress-promising-loan-waiver-as-it-knows-it-wont-come-to-power-5626501.html,firstpost,-1,0
K Nageshwar,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at his first election meeting in Telangana's Nizamabad, called Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao ""anti-development"", claiming he believes more in superstitions and astrology than in public welfare and perpetuates family rule. His   comes completely contrary to his appreciation of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief in the past, that too on the floor of Parliament. While making a comparison with the Andhra Pradesh chief minister and his estranged ally N Chandrababu Naidu, Modi had described KCR as a leader with maturity and one who focuses on development rather than picking up political squabbles. In a bid to answer the critics who describe   in Telangana's political terrain, the BJP leader in Modi made a frantic attempt to not only dispel this thesis but also call TRS as an extended ally of the Congress-led UPA. At a time when the TRS and Congress are engaged in a do-or-die battle, such remarks by the prime minister sound insipid and devoid of any political significance. However, it was inevitable that Modi said so, as he has to ensure a split in the Opposition vote that would harm the Congress, his principal foe in national politics. Modi's speech was clearly aimed at presenting his party as an alternative to both TRS and the Congress-led grand alliance. Therefore, he described both parties as two sides of the same coin. In fact, Modi said KCR had his apprenticeship in dishonest and corrupt politics in the Congress. This is half truth as KCR spent most of his political career in the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) before the launch of TRS, though his political debut was in the Congress. Surprisingly, the prime minister made no mention of the TDP-Congress alliance in the state, which is now the hot topic in the electoral discourse. The Telangana BJP has joined the chorus with TRS in criticising the Congress for enlisting the support of what it calls the Andhra party led by Naidu. But Modi chose not to speak even a word on Naidu, his bitter critic, even though the latter's role in the Telangana elections is now under intense scrutiny. Modi disappointed the average residents of Telangana by speaking nothing on the long list of grievances of the young state. The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre is under fire for not implementing several provisions of Act under which the state was bifurcated and formed and the promises made therein. Instead, the prime minister confined his speech to naming some of his schemes, such as the Ujjwala Yojana, and the estimated benefits due to the implementation of such central schemes in Telangana. In 2014, while speaking at a public meeting in Mahbubnagar on the eve of the elections, the then Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj had said that the next NDA government would grant the Palamuru Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme the status of a national project. The promise remains unfulfilled. Modi is now conspicuously silent on it and many such benefits that have to be accrued to the new state from the central government. The Telangana government has been requesting the Centre to accord such national status to its prestigious Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation project as it is normally a practice to provide every state with at least one national project. Such a status would alleviate the fiscal burden on the state government, thereby allowing it to take up a few more projects. During bifurcation, the state was also promised a steel plant at Bayyaram, a coach factory at Kazipet, a tribal university as well as a branch of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. These promises remain unimplemented despite legislative backing. Instead, with remarkable alacrity within days of coming to power at the Centre, the Modi-led government merged several   of Telangana with Andhra Pradesh through an ordinance. However, the most glaring failure of the central government has been in setting up two separate high courts for the residuary states. Moreover, the UPA government has sanctioned an Information Technology and Investment Region (ITIR) project to Hyderabad, but NDA government scrapped it altogether, thus harming the development of the state. On Tuesday, Modi chose to remain silent on many such complaints emanating from the political system and civil society of Telangana. He chose to dedicate most of his speech to attacking TRS and Congress. A request from the Telangana government is pending with the Centre to allow 12 percent reservation for Muslims and tribals in the state. Although BJP president Amit Shah had minced no words in  , Modi chose not to talk about it, except for criticising both TRS and Congress for their alleged politics of minority appeasement. While Shah repeatedly asked the people of Telangana to vote for the BJP to liberate the state from All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, the prime minister didn't mention this either. Modi's election speech was primarily aimed at carving out a political space for the BJP in Telangana independent of the TRS and the Congress, but he, nevertheless, failed to tell the electorate how the state benefitted under his regime and how it would prosper under BJP rule. Instead, his filled his speech with anti-KCR rhetoric, with occasional jibes at the Congress.",2018-11-27,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,K Chandrashekar Rao,KCR,Modi In Telangana,PoliticsDecoder,TDP,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Elections,Telangana Polls,Telangana Rashtra Samithi,Telugu Desam Party,TRS","In Telangana, Narendra Modi tries to shed image of BJP-TRS camaraderie, but fails to address voter concerns",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/in-telangana-narendra-modi-tries-to-shed-image-of-bjp-trs-camaraderie-but-fails-to-address-voter-concerns-5626751.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Gearing up its entire machinery for Assembly polls in Mizoram, the authorities have decided to connect all polling booths through wireless communication for the first time leaving no ""shadow areas"" at all. Mizoram, having a difficult hilly terrain, is going for Assembly elections on Wednesday to elect 40 MLAs. ""For the first time in Mizoram's election history, all polling booths will be covered by wireless communication. It will help in timely reporting of every development and progress of the polling,"" said Mizoram Deputy Inspector General of Police (Training & Armed Branch) Joseph Lalchhuana. Till the last election in 2014 for the Lok Sabha, not all areas were connected through wireless technology and there was a delay in receiving information from far-flung booths, he added. Lalchhuana, who is also the Assistant State Police Nodal Officer for the Assembly elections, said, ""By doing this (wireless connection), we have eliminated all shadow areas from Mizoram. Shadow areas means the place where there is no communication."" For operating the system as per the Election Commission of India guidelines, special training sessions were conducted for the Mizoram Police personnel and now everything is in place to conduct the polls efficiently, he added. ""We take pride in it. We have tested it under the direct supervision of our Director General of Police Balaji Srivastava and are fully confident of supporting the Election Commission as and when required,"" Lalchhuana said. Mizoram has 7,70,395 registered voters who will cast their franchise in 1,164 polling booths across the state, while an additional 15 special booths have been created at Kanhmun village in Mamit district for the Bru refugees coming from six camps in Tripura. Lalchhuana said that during the poll campaigning, which ended last evening, the Mizoram Police had formed 84 flying squads, 39 dynamic check posts, 80 static surveillance teams and 80 quick response teams across the state to prevent any unlawful activities. ""We have over 50 zonal police officers in the rank of DSP to SP. They are looking at the macro security arrangements in their respective areas. Above them, we have four grid DIGs along with the existing two range DIGs for overall responsibility,"" he added. Mizoram has 38 police stations and it has recently set up five new outposts for ease of surveillance and confidence-building among voters. 
""The total sanctioned strength of Mizoram Police is around 13,000 personnel, but we have around 9,000 persons at present. They all will be involved in the poll process,"" the DIG said. Mizoram Police is being assisted in its poll-related activities by 40 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF), comprising personnel from BSF, SSB, CRPF and Assam Police. Lalchhuana said special attention has been given along the state's borders with Assam, Manipur and Tripura, while the Mizoram DGP has sought cooperation from his counterparts in these states. ""At four inter-state border points, we are monitoring the movement of people through CCTV. This is a new initiative and we installed it before the poll process started,"" he added. Lalchhuana also praised the public for cooperation in overall peace-keeping efforts during the election campaign across the state. 
He appreciated the people for depositing their licenced arms as soon as the election notification was announced despite this being the harvest season that typically sees attacks by wild boars on farmers' produce. ""We are repeatedly thanking the people for their cooperation. Mizoram has a track record of holding free and fair polls in the past. I had joined in 1986 and since then, I have witnessed no violence before or after the polling or after declaration of results,"" Lalchhuana said. The ruling Congress and the main opposition party Mizo National Front (MNF) have fielded 40 candidates each, while the BJP is looking to open its account in the state for the first time by contesting in 39 seats. The Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM), an alliance formed by two political parties and four groups, is contesting in 35 seats.

Press Trust of India,": Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday sought to appeal to Telangana pride when he referred to AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi's recent remark that whoever became the chief minister of Telangana or undivided Andhra Pradesh had to bow before his party. Addressing a poll rally at Mahbubnagar, Modi asked the people whether they would vote for someone who bows at the feet of some leader.  ""A leader recently said whoever became the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh-Telangana had to be at his feet (kadmon ke neeche).

Press Trust of India,"In a series of rallies Tuesday in poll-bound Rajasthan, BJP chief Amit Shah slammed the Congress over corruption, caste-based politics and Bangladeshi migrants. Corruption was commonplace when the UPA government was in power at the Centre, he alleged in Pali. “From 2G and ISRO scam in space, AgustaWestland chopper scam in the sky, Adarsh Society scam on land, submarine scam underwater and coal mining scam beneath the earth, the Congress did not leave a place where they didn't do a scam,” he said. He claimed four generations of a family in the Congress enjoyed power for years but did not work for development. The party has no leadership, policy or principles, he charged. He targeted the Congress leaders for asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's caste, saying that the leaders of the Opposition party had stooped low. Shah addressed public meetings in Jalore, Sirohi, Pali and Udaipur districts of the state, which goes to the polls on 7 December. In Jalore, he reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party government was committed to sending back illegal migrants. “Vote for Vasundhara Raje in 2018 in Rajasthan and vote for Narendra Modi in 2019. We will find intruders and throw them out of the country, one by one,” Shah said. 
The Congress did nothing to address the issue of illegal migrants, he said. The allegation was also made in the manifesto for the Assembly polls, released Tuesday by the BJP in Jaipur. Attacking Congress president Rahul Gandhi, he said, ""Rahul`baba' asks us to give a report of our four and a half years of performance. He and his family have been in power for four and a half generations. They should be the first one to talk about their performance."" He said the Congress lost elections across states in the last four years and it is now difficult to find the party “even with binoculars”. “It is good to dream but the Congress chief is daydreaming to form the government in Rajasthan. I want to say once again that the BJP is going to form the government here,” Shah said. He referred to a reported incident in Bikaner where Congress workers raising 'Bharat mata ki jai' slogans were interrupted by 'Sonia Gandhi ki jai' slogans. “They are ashamed of chanting slogans for the country,"" he said.

Rangoli Agrawal,"Unlike the Congress' Madhya Pradesh manifesto, Lord Ram is unlikely to figure in the Congress’ Rajasthan manifesto. Rajasthan’s voters have more mundane and personal concerns: employment, healthcare and effective implementation of welfare policies. As was revealed in responses to the party’s “Jan Ghoshna Patra” campaign on social media, which was crowdsourced from voters. As part of the campaign, state Congress president Sachin Pilot tweeted: ‘Aap Rajasthan mein aane wali Congress se kya chahte hain? (What do you expect from the incoming Congress government?)’ The tweet gave a mobile number to which people could send suggestions using WhatsApp. Party officials said they received more than 95,000 suggestions between 3 and 23 November. “We have classified the suggestions into various categories and prepared a draft which will be considered while preparing the manifesto,” said Naresh Dadhich, member, Congress Election Manifesto Committee. “Many messages were complaints from government employees on issues that they want resolved. For example, about 26,000 teachers were recently selected for state schools but there has been no forward movement. Some teachers had been absorbed during Ashok Gehlot’s tenure, but their service conditions had some issues which are yet to be resolved. Similarly, some asked that the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations be implemented from 1 January, 2016, instead of 1 January, 2017. Different sectors have different problems, like those employed on contractual basis, that have not been resolved for five years, which they are bringing to us.” Plenty of responses raised the familiar issues of loan waiver and reduction in electricity bills of farmers. Also included were some less familiar ones, like animals roaming free on the roads. “There are problems which we are not even aware of,” said Dadhich. “The most common complaints are from government employees and youth demanding employment. But that too is divided into sub-categories. For example, students selected for the Rajasthan Public Service Commission are facing some unresolved issues”. Suggestions on education, health, and agriculture also figure in the replies, though employment generation remains the key concern. “We received several messages regarding poor implementation of state and central government schemes,” said Vibhuti Bhushan Sharma, advocate and member of manifesto committee. “Availability of medicines and ration for instance”. Respondents also pointed out that the skill development centre is not functioning properly. Other welfare schemes like Bhamashah have several shortcomings that need to be addressed. For example, the scheme has a special provision for urban poor, with a caveat that a city cannot have more than 69 percent urban poor. That figure has not been re-evaluated since it was first announced five years ago. As a result, many urban poor people are not receiving benefits of the scheme. “There is no system for revision of the list,” Dadhich said. Meanwhile, a Twitter war is raging regarding the number of jobs created by the BJP government. Sachin Pilot claimed only two lakh new jobs were created. Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje tweeted that 44 lakh jobs have been provided. “We have also skilled about 15 lakh youth, that is also a way of job creation,” Raje further tweeted. However, experts point out that a lack of credible and up-to-date data raises doubts on government’s claims. “Both the central and the state government have not done well on job creation,” said Nesar Ahmed, coordinator, Budget Analysis Rajasthan Centre. State BJP spokesperson Vimal Katiyar countered, “It is not the people but the Congress that is blaming us for non-implementation of policy. Go out and speak to people, they will tell you how much work is done and how much effort we have put in so that people can live with self-respect”. The Congress has also launched a website seeking suggestions from people across the country for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.",2018-11-27,"Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,Bharatiya Janata Party,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Demonetisation,GST,Narendra Modi,PoliticsOnTheGo,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2019,Rajasthan Polls,Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha 2019,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje","Congress crowdsources Rajasthan manifesto for Vidhan Sabha polls; employment, healthcare on voters' minds",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-crowdsources-rajasthan-manifesto-for-vidhan-sabha-polls-employment-healthcare-on-voters-minds-5627231.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sunil Dhavala,"Madhya Pradesh will vote on Wednesday to either give the BJP a fourth successive term in power notwithstanding anti-incumbency or give a chance to the challenger Congress to break the saffron party's monopoly over power for the last 15 years. The campaign has been high decibel, often marked by bitter personal attacks, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi leading the charge of their parties. The contest is mainly between the BJP and Congress though the Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party are also in the fray. Apart from Modi's appeal, the BJP is banking on the image of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and its organisational structure. Party President Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and union ministers Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley campaigned in the state. The Congress put up a spirited fight by raising issues concerning people and putting up a united fight by keeping the issue of leadership at bay. Rahul Gandhi sought to rejuvenate the state unit by appointing Kamal Nath as the party chief in April this year and naming Jyotiraditya Scindia, MP, as the campaign chief. Among the 2,907 candidates in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP has fielded candidates for all 230 seats while the Congress is contesting in 229 seats leaving one seat, Jatara in Tikamgarh district, for Sharad Yadav-led LJD.

FP Staff,"Mizoram, a Christian-majority state, has 39 out of 40 seats in the Assembly reserved for Scheduled Tribes. As the state goes to polls on 28 November, here's a look at the most important constituencies: Serchhip is set for a key battle on 28 November with four prominent leaders in the fray. Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla has won an Assembly seat from Serchhip for the past three elections: 2003, 2008 and 2013. This time too, he filed his nomination from Serchhip, apart from Champhai South. Former president of Mizoram Journalists Association Kapliana Pachuau, who recently joined the National People’s Party (NPP) will also be contesting from the constituency. Zoram Nationalist Party president and Zoram People’s Movement chief ministerial candidate Lalduhoma will also be in fray from Serchhip. The newly-formed Zoramthar party has fielded their president Rev Zaichhawna Hlawndo as their Serchhip candidate. Tuichawang and West Tuipui are Chakma-dominated seats. In 2017, the Mizoram NGO coordination committee — the apex body comprising major NGOs, including the Central Young Mizo Association and Mizo Zirlai Pawl — parties to not field Chakmas, who are branded ""illegal immigrants"" from Bangladesh. The ruling Congress, and BJP defied the committee's diktat. For Tuichawang, the Congress has fielded Amit Kumar Chakma, while the BJP has fielded former Congress minister and prominent Chakma leader BD Chakma. In West Tuipui, Congress legislator Nihar Kanti Chakma has been pitted against BJP's Kina Ranjan Chakma. Meanwhile, the MNF fielded Robert Lalhmingsanga, an advocate. In the 2013 election, the Congress won the Lengteng constituency after a neck-and-neck fight with the MNF. While Congress' H Rohluna polled 5,682 votes, MNF's Thangmawia secured 5,515 votes. This time, Congress again fielded Rohluna from Lengteng, while the BJP has given a ticket to a woman candidate, Laldinngheti.

Debobrat Ghose,"As the curtain comes down on the high-voltage electoral campaigning by the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress in Madhya Pradesh for the votes to be cast on 28 November, both parties are keeping their fingers crossed. Who will win Madhya Pradesh? The betting market is swinging on both sides: sometimes in favour of Congress and sometimes for the BJP. Uncertainty looms on whether the BJP under Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will return to power for a fourth consecutive term or if fortune will smile on the Congress after its long electoral drought. Political analysts think Congress hasn’t succeeded in building a narrative against Chouhan. People do not complain against Chouhan, but against the lower bureaucracy and uncaring BJP MLAs, some of whom are also corrupt, they add. In fact, Chouhan has, over the years, emerged as a brand not only of the party, but also the state. “Congress couldn’t build a strong issue-based narrative against Shivraj Singh government, except announcing debt waiver for farmers and tackling unemployment. It’s not necessary that those who’re unhappy (and not angry) with the BJP government will vote for the Congress,” Bhopal-based political commentator Girija Shankar said. The high-decibel campaigning in Madhya Pradesh witnessed 10 rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 27 of BJP president Amit Shah, 178 of Chouhan along with his Jan Aashirwad Yatra criss-crossing the state. Unlike the BJP, Congress didn’t have many star campaigners. While Congress president Rahul Gandhi addressed 15 rallies, Jyotiraditya Scindia held the highest rallies for the party (103). MPCC president Kamal Nath addressed a few rallies, with a focus on organisational support, while courting a controversy on a video allegedly slamming the RSS over minority issue. The issues raised by the BJP and the Congress leaders were more national than state-level: Ram Mandir, Rafale deal. The Opposition Congress couldn’t make ‘Vyapam scam’ a big issue. One may recall, five years ago the ‘Vyapam scam’—the biggest one till date in Madhya Pradesh—relating to irregularities in medical admissions and other recruitment examinations conducted by the state government was unearthed. It had almost dislodged Chouhan, but the BJP salvaged the crisis by handing the case to the CBI. The state population is nearly 90 percent Hindu, which prompted Congress to toe a soft-Hindutva line. It is in the battlefield of Madhya Pradesh where Congress president Rahul Gandhi visited Jyotirlinga shrines Omkareshwar and Mahakaleshwar, and was projected as a ‘Shiv-bhakt’, and ‘pandit Rahul Gandhi’. But Rahul's new avatar has drawn criticism. Congress has successfully raked up the farmer distress that erupted in Mandsaur in 2017. Despite the state government’s quick measures to quell farmers' anger, election results will show if the Congress succeeded in swinging the issue in its favour. “The pro-poor schemes of Shivraj Singh government will help the BJP to get support from the poor and economically-weaker sections of the society, especially the urban poor,” former   resident editor NK Singh told  . “However, on the issue of farmers, the house is evenly divided. A section of rich farmers who gained from the government would support the BJP. There’s no doubt that the state government has done a lot for farmers in comparison to the Congress government in the past, but it’s not enough. What has been offered to the farmers is less than their input cost. The government scheme ‘Bhaavantar Yojna’ is a big racket and plunder of the State exchequer, as traders (also middlemen) and a few rich farmers have got benefit, whereas the small and marginal farmers haven’t,” he added. · Unlike in the case of the former chief minister Digvijay Singh, there’s no anger directly against Chouhan. · No large-scale complaint against Chouhan on basic amenities like electricity, road and water, as against the Congress between 2000 and 2003. · Strong organisational base. · Active role of frontal organisations of RSS-BJP and their grassroots reach. · Chouhan’s image as a son of the soil. He brought in the ‘insider-outsider’ narrative into play during the last 15 years. · Strong support from those living in slums and economically-weaker sections (EWS) due to state government schemes, especially housing scheme (Awas Yojna). · Large-scale rebellion in the form of Independent candidates, who failed to get either a BJP ticket, a post or favour from the party. · Upper castes and a section of middle-class voters are disturbed over SC/ST Atrocities Act, high fuel prices. · Mid-level businessmen, small and medium level farmers who are politically influential are vocal against the BJP. · High-voltage campaigning in the form of rallies and roadshows with star campaigners like Modi, Shah and Chouhan. · Anti-incumbency factor against the BJP. · A section of voters wants a change in government. · Farmer distress that erupted in Mandsaur district and the anger among small and marginal farmers may help Congress, especially due to ‘Bhaavantar Yojna’. · People’s anger against bureaucracy and BJP MLAs · Long absence of senior leaders of Congress in the state. They are being considered more as ‘outsiders’, who have spent less time in state politics. · Weak frontal organisations of Congress that lack grassroots connectivity. · A large section of voters still unable to forget Digvijay Singh’s disastrous second term (1998 to 2003) and poor infrastructure that earned the state the infamous ‘Bimaru’ tag. · Lack of cohesive leadership in the state over the last 15 years, which has weakened the party at organisational level. · Factionalism within party’s state leadership. · Soft-Hindutva line adopted by the Congress won’t make much dent in BJP, rather it has attracted more criticism.",2018-11-27,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Caste Politics,Congress,Farmers In India,Farmers In Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Polls,MP Assembly Election,PoliticalPlay,SC/ST Act,Shivraj Singh Chouhan","Congress has failed to build narrative against Madhya Pradesh CM in run-up to Vidhan Sabha polls, say analysts",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-has-failed-to-build-narrative-against-madhya-pradesh-cm-in-run-up-to-vidhan-sabha-polls-say-analysts-5626911.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The day before the people of Madhya Pradesh cast their votes in the state Vidhan Sabha polls, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted a seven-second video of former prime minister Manmohan Singh purportedly praising the BJP state governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. However, this tweet attempting to blunt the Congress and its chief Rahul Gandhi's criticism of the two state governments seems mischievous because Malviya provided no context for the video. The tweet neither mentioned the date when the video was shot nor did it explain the context in which Manmohan said, ""The governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were very good."" In fact, apart from this one line in the video—which lasts for all of seven seconds— nothing else is clear. It is not even clear whether Manmohan was referring to the current Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh governments or some erstwhile regimes. But what is clear is that Malviya is claiming Manmohan was referring to the current governments. What is also probable is that this is a mischievous attempt at gaining votes just a day before Madhya Pradesh elections by posting a video which has as much context as this: During his rally in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar, Rahul   Prime Minister Narendra Modi betrayed the people, and claimed that he had not fulfilled promises of providing two crore jobs every year and ""depositing"" Rs 15 lakh in their bank accounts. Rahul addressed election rallies at Sagar, Damoh and Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region of poll-bound Madhya Pradesh on Saturday.

Debobrat Ghose,"Congress is gleefully lapping up the opportunity to poke fun at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for indulging in dynastic politics as the latter has distributed tickets to kith and kin of many party leaders for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election on Wednesday. For long the Congress has been at the receiving end on this account and it's now Congress' chance to turn the tables. As many as 42 candidates in the BJP's list for the 230 seats are either sons, daughters or relatives of party leaders. The Congress, by comparison, has a little over a dozen. Leaders from both the BJP and Congress whose children or kin have got tickets range from a former prime minister to former chief ministers and from the present Union ministers to former legislators. In this election, the BJP has given tickets to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s nephew Anup Mishra from Bhitarwar, former chief ministers -- Sunderlal Patwa’s nephew Surendra Patwa from Bhojpur, Kailash Joshi’s son Deepak Joshi from Haat Pipaliya, Virendra Kumar Saklecha’s son Om Prakash Saklecha and Babulal Gaur’s daughter-in-law Krishna Gaur from Govindpura in Bhopal. While Anup Mishra had been a minister in Madhya Pradesh in the past, Patwa and Joshi are currently holding portfolios in Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet. Krishna Gaur is also a former mayor. The BJP leadership gave a ticket to her after Babulal Gaur decided to contest as an independent candidate from Govindpura seat from where had been elected 10 times in a row. Due to age limitation factor (up to 75 years), he wasn’t given a ticket. BJP stalwart Rajmata of Gwalior Vijaya Raje Scindia’s daughter Yashodhara Raje has got a ticket to contest from Shivpuri. She’s also a serving minister in the state. Two former speakers of Madhya Pradesh Assembly – Ishwardas Rohani’s son Ashok Lohani and Brajmohan Mishra’s daughter Archana Chitnis — have been given tickets from Jabalpur Cantonment and Burhanpur respectively. Chitnis also served as a minister. Besides this, relatives of present and former Union ministers have got tickets for their children or siblings -- like Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot and Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Uma Bharti have got tickets for their son Jitendra Gehlot (Aalot) and nephew Rahul Lodhi (Khargapur) respectively. Former Union ministers Vikram Verma and Prahlad Patel have got tickets for their wife Neeta Verma (Dhar) and brother Jalan Singh Patel (Narsighpur). The rest 30 candidates are either sons, daughters or siblings of ex-ministers of Madhya Pradesh and present and former Members of Parliament and MLAs, including BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s son Akash Vijayvargiya. In comparison to the BJP, this time Congress has lesser numbers when it comes to distributing tickets to family members of party leaders. Former chief minister Digvijaya Singh has secured tickets for his son Jaivardhan Singh, who’s a sitting MLA from Raghogarh; brother Lakshman Singh — a former MP and MLA and nephew Priyavrat Singh. Former chief minister Arjun Singh's son Ajay Singh is contesting from Churhat seat. Congress has given tickets to children and relatives of former ministers in the Digvijaya Singh cabinet-- Hemant Katare, son of Satyadev Katare; Om Prakash Raghuvanshi, son of Hajarilal Raghuvanshi; Umang, nephew of Jamuna Devi; Kamleshwar Patel, son of Indrajit Patel and KK Kalukheda, brother of Mahendra Singh Kalukheda. Former Union minister in the UPA government, Kantilal Bhuria got tickets for his son Vikrant Bhuria, a physician by profession and niece Kalavati Bhuria to contest from Jhabua and Jobat respectively. The party has also given tickets to Alok Chaturvedi, brother of Rajya Sabha member from Khajuraho, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, who has been expelled from Congress on 19 November for six years. Sons of former deputy chief minister in the Digvijaya Singh government the late Subhash Yadav’s sons – Arun Yadav and Sachin Yadav have got tickets to contest from Budhni and Kasrawad respectively. Former Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee president and ex-Union minister in the UPA, Arun Yadav will contest against Chief Minister Chouhan, considered as the latter’s home turf. Congress president Rahul Gandhi in March during the AICC plenary session had said, “We will have to change the organisation. There are workers sitting at the back. They have the energy to change the country. But there is a wall between them and the leaders. My first task is to break that wall… give them preference while distributing tickets to contest elections.” But in reality, things are different to the claims made by leaders. Both the BJP and the Congress have claimed that tickets have been given to candidates based on ‘winnability’ factor. “Earlier also both Congress and BJP had given tickets to its own people like sons, daughters or close relatives. In the last election, BJP gave around 20 tickets; but in this election, it’s all-time high,” remarked Bhopal-based political commentator Girija Shankar. “This Assembly election is the toughest for the BJP in last 15 years, whereas it’s crucial for the Congress party,” Shankar said.",2018-11-27,"Akash Vijayvargiya,Anup Mishra,Assembly Election 2018,Babulal Gaur,Deepak Joshi,Digvijaya Singh,Haat Pipaliya,Jaivardhan Singh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Surendra Patwa,Yashodhara Raje",Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls: BJP list offers fodder for Congress to return the dynasty jibe,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-vidhan-sabha-polls-bjp-list-offers-fodder-for-congress-to-return-the-dynasty-jibe-5621871.html,firstpost,-1,0

Ajay Singh,"During his stint as BJP general secretary (organisation) and in-charge of Madhya Pradesh affairs in the late 1990s, Narendra Modi had acquired a new nickname. He was called  , because of his persuasive way of running the party's organisation and reshuffling the support base. Of course, in 1998 Madhya Pradesh emerged as a strong bastion of the BJP which retained a substantial support among urban areas and upper castes. Historically the state is also known for having the most robust organisation of the BJP and its earlier avatar, Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), on account of the party’s sustained activities on ground. Overseeing all this development and enabling the BJP to grow from strength to strength was the most efficient organisation man in the BJP – Kushabhau Thakre who also took over as the party president in 1998. But Thakre’s style of building and consolidating the party organisation was quite traditional, straight from the textbook. He roped in workers from within the Sangh Parivar constituents and trained them to become political activists. In 1998, Modi in introduced radical changes in the Madhya Pradesh unit that rubbed the traditional leadership of the party the wrong way. And MP had a plenty of top leaders ranging from Sunder Lal Patwa, Vikram Varma and Kailash Joshi to young, emerging leaders like Uma Bharti. Modi encouraged a new breed of leadership and goaded the organisaton into expanding its arc of influence to the scheduled castes and tribals whom he regarded as low-hanging fruits. His efforts met with strong resistance from within the BJP’s state leadership. Yet he continued with the strategy of reorganising the social bases and roping in marginalised sections to the Hindutva fold. Though the BJP lost the state election in 1998, the party's expansion was quite evident among tribals, OBCs and SCs – the sections that traditionally sided with the Congress. In 2003 assembly elections, the emergence of Uma Bharti and subsequently Shivraj Singh Chouhan was a natural corollary to the persuasive strategy of organisational expansion of none else but the “Master Sahib” of 1998. There is little doubt that the 15 years of BJP’s uninterrupted reign has come with a cost. Its traditional supporters, the land-owning upper castes, are substantially alienated. Yet, there is a strong possibility that this political attrition is replaced by an accretion of social bases from marginalized sections, particularly from SCs, tribals and the urban poor. Intriguingly, this numerically strong social base is not as articulate as conventional BJP supporters. In Malwa region of the state, the BJP does not seem to be on as sticky a wicket as it is in Chambal and Bundelkhand where the party is facing severe anti-incumbency. The region which comprises a significant part of the state is urbanised and prosperous. For instance, Indore is known as “mini Mumbai” for people of the state due to its prospering trade and business. The city is a delight for foodies and street-food is a craze. At Sarrafa Bazar, which is the biggest centre for business of gold, diamonds and ornaments, there is palpable dullness as compared to the past. “Yes, our business has gone down since demonetisation,” acknowledge shopkeepers. Yet, they do not hold it against the prime minister. “We are BJP voters and we cannot think of going elsewhere,” they say when asked if their voting choice will change this time. Indore is a strong bastion of the BJP from where Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan has won the eight times in a row. In the past decade, the city has transformed itself into a model for the rest of India on account of its cleanliness and civic facilities. Only 15 years back, the city was a veritable urban mess during Digvijay Singh’s tenure. Even slums are refurbished and provided with amenities to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. The changing face of Indore and its adjoining urban areas has found appreciation even among the marginalised people. By no indication, this BJP bastion is showing any sign of vulnerability. The union government’s schemes of facilitating house construction of the poor, access to electricity and cooking gas in rural areas have found great resonance among the electorate. There is no doubt that people’s aspiration has risen exponentially over the years. And 15 years is a long time for people to get weary of one dispensation. Yet the electorate is quite wary of a change for the worse. Given the history of Digvijay Singh’s one decade of governance from 1993-2003, a substantial number of people from the older generation is not only cynical about the Congress but recall with trepidation about the past. And the presence of a scion of the erstwhile Gwalior state, Jyotiraditya Scindia, and industrialist Kamal Nath does not adequately assure the electorate that the Congress leaders will change their spots. In this region, the BJP’s social engineering, robust organisation and Modi’s charm will combine to protect the turf of Shivraj Singh Chouhan. As far as the Congress is concerned, it seems to have internalised the dictum, “Losing, like winning, is a habit.""",2018-11-27,"Bharatiya Jana Sangh,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP Bastion,Congress,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Election,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Polls,MP Assembly Elections,Narendra Modi,PoliticsDecoder,Sonia Gandhi",Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls: Narendra Modi's 1998 experiments in social engineering might save day for BJP,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-vidhan-sabha-polls-narendra-modis-1998-experiments-in-social-engineering-might-save-day-for-bjp-5622571.html,firstpost,-1,0

Asian News International,": Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah on Monday hit out at the Congress party for not conferring former prime minister Atal Bihar Vajpayee with the Bharat Ratna. Vajpayee was presented the country's highest civilian award at his residence in 2015, few months after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power. ""Vajpayee told me that when he made his 1st speech, Nehru went to him and said Atal you will be the Prime Minister of this nation one day. He coming from an RSS background realised that this nation can't be built by one, but by all. Those who built this in the past can't be forgotten. The point I have against Congress is that they should have given him the Bharat Ratna when he was in alive and in good health,"" Abdullah said at a book launch event in the capital. Abdullah also accused Narendra Modi of not maintaining the dignity of the Prime Minister's Office and credited former prime ministers Rajiv and Indira Gandhi for where the country stands today. ""I think it is the quality of the people in the government. It is nothing else. The quality goes down to the level of forgetting what Nehru contributed to this country, what Indira Gandhi gave to this country. She gave her life. Rajiv Gandhi and other Prime Ministers- did they not give their entire time to build this nation? If we are sitting here, it is because of them. But what is he talking about?

Maheswara Reddy," As Telangana inches closes to polling day on 7 December, all's not well with the Mahakutami or Grand Alliance of the Congress, TDP, CPI and newly-formed Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) party in the state. As if the much-publicised trust deficit between the rivals-turned-allies wasn't enough, reports of how ""greed"" and ""lack of discipline"" among the alliance partners may cost them their chance to defeat the state's ruling TRS, are trickling in. This is most visible in the allies' squabble over seat-sharing that has been  . In the so-called ""friendly contests"" playing out between the Congress and TJS in at least four — Khanapur, Dubbaka, Asifabad and Warangal (East) — of the 119 Vidhan Sabha seats, the Grand Old Party has fielded candidates despite TJS candidates filing nominations as well. That there was little coordination among members of the   seemed visible from Day One. First, there was the delay over the announcement of candidates, then over   to the alliance partners and then the slow efforts to withdraw other candidates from contesting the seats given to the allies. The Congress was frequently blamed for acting as Big Brother but without commitment to the common cause. Now, the ""friendly contests"" are giving sleepless nights to candidates like K Vijay, TJS' man from the Asifabad constituency — not to mention ample opportunity to TRS campaigners to criticise the grand alliance as a ""grand failure"". ""How can you call it a friendly contest?"" asks Vijay, ""What is the meaning of a friendly contest? It is nothing but backstabbing. Congress leaders have not only cheated me but also our leader Professor Kodandaram (founder of TJS). It is the Congress that promised to allocate us eight seats including Janagaon from where our leader was supposed to contest. Finally, what happened? The Congress has fielded its candidates without bothering about our presence in these seats."" The pro-alliance voters too seem confused about who should get their votes in these seats — the Congress or TJS. ""We were very happy when the Congress, TDP, CPI and TJS joined hands. But now, we are in a dilemma in Asifabad. I am not sure whom Kodandaram will accompany during the poll campaign — the Congress candidate or the TJS candidate,"" says K Bheema Rao, a Congress supporter. Terming the Mahakutami a ""total failure"" and ""sham"", Telakapalli Ravi, political analyst and writer, alleges the alliance was shaky from the start. ""The 'friendly contests' will split the votes among the friendly contenders and finally help their main rival (TRS) win the election. It will not help the Mahakutami but may just help gauge the popularity of candidates. The Mahakutami should have avoided fielding more than one candidate from one constituency. Going by the Congress attitude, it seems it wanted to rope in Kodandaram, but does not want to help him in the election,"" Ravi opines. CH Rajendar, a TJS candidate contesting from Dubbaka in Siddipet district, also came down heavily on the Congress, accusing it of betrayal. He attributed caste as the main factor behind the Congress fielding its nominee, Maddula Nageshwar Reddy, against him. ""My joy knew no bounds when Kodandaram selected me to contest from Dubbaka. I belong to the backward class community. When I filed the nomination papers, Kodandaram accompanied me. The voters were enthusiastic. Around 18,000 people went with me for the filing. But not many are with me now that the Congress candidate has also filed nomination papers,"" he says. ""There was an offer from the Congress candidate, asking me to withdraw my nomination, but I declined. I do not want to be branded a cheat by accepting money from the Congress candidate. I am not saying I will win from Dubbaka, but it is an opportunity to showcase my popularity there,"" Rajendar adds. According to activist Professor Haragopal, a lack of confidence about the winnability of candidates is one reason behind the so-called friendly-contests. ""The other reason is that the party leadership has no control over the candidates. Also, they lack discipline and patience,'' he says. For him, such contests are aimed at getting publicity or money from opponents for withdrawing from the contest in their favour. ""Some candidates just want to test their popularity. It will tell them whether to remain in the party or to switch to another. It will also help the party leadership evaluate a candidate's capacity for future elections,'' the professor explains. But Kodam Kumar, president of the Telangana Vidya Vanthula Vedike, Jalagaon district, believes that money and muscle power play a key role in elections. ""I am sure that candidates who can spend crores of rupees can win. I want the Election Commission to ban meetings and campaign programmes during the polls. The candidates must remain at their homes or party offices, and voters should be allowed to select the right person,'' Kumar insists. Meanwhile, TJS spokesperson G Venkat Reddy made it clear that Kodandaram will canvass for his party's candidates and will accompany the Congress, TDP and CPI candidates where the TJS had not fielded its own. It also turns out that the squabble over seats was the very thing the professor had feared. , he had said that it was of utmost importance that the alliance’s seat-sharing deal be settled soon so that they can get on with campaigning as a united force — he was wary of losing the momentum that news of the Mahakutami had generated among those opposed to TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao’s rule.",2018-11-27,"Communist Party Of India,Congress,K Vijay,Mahakutami,NewsTracker,Professor Kodandaram,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Jana Samithi,Telangana Vidhan Sabha,Telangana Vidhan Sabha Election 2018,Telugu Desam Party","Curious tale of Telangana's 'Mahakutami': Trust deficit, 'lack of discipline' threaten to derail anti-TRS Grand Alliance",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/curious-tale-of-telanganas-mahakutami-trust-deficit-lack-of-discipline-threaten-to-derail-anti-trs-grand-alliance-5624001.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"In December 2006, Manmohan Singh was prime minister, heading the UPA government. At a meeting of the National Development Council in New Delhi, he sought to redefine secularism and outlined how his government liked to prioritise welfare of one community over everyone else in the country. He famously announced, ""Muslims must have first claim over resources"". Over a decade later, the Congress, struggling to counter the ""Muslim party"" tag, has gone a step further by proposing a series of benefits meant exclusively for the Muslim community in Telangana, if its government comes to power after the 7 December election in the state. The party is also proposing to offer some sops to the Christian Church, which has in various parts of the country often been at loggerheads with the Narendra Modi regime and the BJP. The manifesto is yet to be released. The leaked contents of a draft manifesto have been in circulation since Monday evening, but the Congress party has not denied the veracity of its contents. Some of the promises that the Congress outlined in its draft manifesto are as follows: Free supply of electricity to mosques and churches, some government contracts to be marked exclusively for Muslim youths, Rs 20 lakh in aid for impoverished Muslim students, residential schools for Muslim boys and girls, hospitals meant only for Muslim patients, strict governmental action against those private entities that refuse to hire Muslims and a selection panel to be constituted for recruitment of Urdu teachers. Jawaharlal Nehru's concept of secularism has clearly been twisted by the Congress under the dispensation of his great grandson Rahul Gandhi. From ""Muslims have first right to resources"" under the Sonia Gandhi-Manmohan Singh regime to free power supply for Muslims, in addition to hospitals, schools, monetary aid and so on, the Congress has taken long strides to seek the votes of one particular community. The question is why distinguish between citizens X and Y? Those needing medical care are entitled to an equal measure of attention by hospitals without distinguishing whether a patient was a Hindu or a Muslim. Why distinguish between places of worship of various religion in terms of government aid and support? What makes a mosque and church entitled to a free electricity supply in their premises and why should a temple or gurudwara be deprived of free electricity supply? The list of questions goes on. The Congress will need to respond to its new found governance model. By doing so, the Congress is trying to outwit the TRS and AIMIM in Telangana in a race to garner a larger portion of Muslim votes. The Congress lost its support base in the Muslim community in the 1980s and early 1990s, mainly because of the way the party conducted the Ayodhya issue and the way emerging regional parties in various parts of the country proved to be a better counter to the RSS-BJP's Hindutva mobilisation. The Congress could get Muslim support only in areas where the BJP and Congress were pitted head-to-head, where no strong regional force was present. The party suffered from a trust deficit from both the majority Hindu community and minority Hindu community. Ironically, in the places where the Congress is in direct contest with the BJP, it is making an overt Hindutva posture and where the BJP is a marginal force and the Congress is engaged in a fight with a regional force, the latter is taking a pro-minority tilt. That shows the kind of confusion from which the Congress currently suffers. In the Gujarat election, Rahul Gandhi became a ""Janeudhari Hindu"" (Brahmin) and for the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha elections, he would become an ""ananay Shiv bhakt"". His party promised to create a new spiritual/religious department in Madhya Pradesh, construct a Ram   path, build   (cow sheds) in every district, find a great deal of virtue in   (cow urine) and make lofty promises to commercialise it. Digvijaya Singh would tweet a recorded entry of Motilal Nehru in a register kept by a priest in Pushkar to claim that Rahul Gandhi is in fact a Kashmiri Brahmin. The issue here is not what Motilal Nehru or Jawaharlal Nehru's caste or   was. The issue here is Rahul's attempt to claim his grandmother’s father's Kashmiri Brahmin lineage (not his grandfather's Parsi lineage) in north India to suggest that he is a better Hindu than those in the BJP leadership, and the electoral benefits he is aiming in north Indian states. A few days ago, Congress leader CP Joshi had overtly pronounced that only Brahmins could speak of Hindus and Hinduism and in the same vein, had questioned Modi’s caste and religion. In the south Indian state of Telangana, the party is taking a completely different Muslim appeasement turn. The party perhaps is compelled to do so in Telangana because it does not have a Kamal Nath-like leader there, who in a closed-door meeting attempted to convince Muslims that at least 90 percent of the members of the community must come out and vote for the Congress.",2018-11-27,"Congress,Congress Manifesto,Muslim Appeasement,Narendra Modi,PoliticalPlay,Rahul Gandhi,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Vidhan Sabha Election 2018,Vidhan Sabha Elections 2018","Congress' leaked 'Muslim appeasement' draft manifesto for Telangana polls exposes confused, bipolar party",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-leaked-muslim-appeasement-draft-manifesto-for-telangana-vidhan-sabha-polls-exposes-confused-bipolar-party-5625671.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"grand old The debate whether India should be a dynastic democracy has been ignited by a self-goal of the Congress Party. The Prime Minister’s mother’s age was made a subject matter of the electoral debate. His father’s anonymity was commented upon as an inadequate credential of the Prime Minister. The argument given was that if you represent the legacy of a well-known family, it is a political point in your favour. Millions of talented political workers who come from modest family backgrounds would fail by the Congress test of leadership. Merit, talent, ability to inspire and lead would not be a virtue. The Congress considers only a great surname as a political brand. On hearing this rationale, I asked a few well informed friends of mine three questions: 
(1) What is the name of Gandhiji’s father? 
(2) What is the name of Sardar Patel’s father? 
(3) What is the name of Sardar Patel’s wife? None of my well informed friends had a definitive answer. This is the tragedy of Congress politics and its impact on the nation. Gandhiji led the most extraordinary freedom movement of India. He created, through political awareness, Satyagraha and non-violence, an environment where British found it impossible to continue in India. Sardar Patel’s contribution was second to none. Besides being a frontline leader of the freedom movement, he, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, negotiated the transfer of power with the British. He negotiated the integration of India with over 550 rulers. He gave to India, within a short period of few months, its present geography. Incidentally, Gandhiji’s father was Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, Sardar Patel’s father was Jhaverbhai Patel and his wife’s name was Diwali Ba. No photograph of his wife or her details are available even after extensive research by modern day historians. The reason for this is simple. Decades of Congress rule, naming colonies, localities, cities, bridges, airports, railway stations, schools, colleges, universities, stadiums after one family was intended to declare the ‘Gandhis’ as India’s royalty. They were ‘officially glamorised’ as the blue blooded family of India. The others did not matter. In fact, upon Sardar Patel’s death in Mumbai, Prime Minister Nehru requested many of his cabinet colleagues that the best tribute to the Sardar would be to work on the day of his funeral and not go to Mumbai. The then Head of State and several Union Ministers defied the advice. The proposal for building his statue at Vijay Chowk was rejected. The country had to be satisfied with the installation of his statue at a traffic round-about on Parliament Street. Many believe that Sardar Patel was a farmer leader because of his participation in Bardoli Satyagraha. On the contrary, he was one of Ahmedabad’s most successful practicing Barristers. Panditji is passed off as a great lawyer though he never argued a single case in his entire career. He only went to court once for reasons of tokenism to sit behind senior lawyers led by Bholabhai Desai who was arguing for the three INA officers in the mutiny trial inside the Red Fort. The dangers of officially glamorising one family at the cost of those who made a far greater contribution is dangerous both for the nation as also for the party to which they belong. The contribution of other great stalwarts like Patel and Subhash Chandra Bose is downplayed. Members of one family are projected as larger than life. Their aberrations become national aberrations. The party adopts them as its ideology. When Panditji promoted his daughter as his successor, he laid the foundation of India as a dynastic democracy. When the daughter, in 1975, turned dictatorial, it became the party’s ideology to convert India into a “disciplined democracy”. When the Sikh were massacred in 1984, communal polarisation against them was considered a legitimate electoral strategy. Today anti-BJPsm leads the Congress to a situation where it can tie up even with its political rivals and sympathise with the Maoists, separatists and disruptionists. The country pays a price for dynastic policies as we have witnessed in several regions. Three families – two of them in Srinagar and one in New Delhi in the last 71 years, have played with the destiny of Jammu and Kashmir. The consequences are obvious. Following the dynastic pattern of leadership within the Congress, several other parties have followed the same principle. In such organisations there is no inner party democracy, there are no ideological principles. There is a complete flexibility to switch sides and align with your erstwhile political opponents. In Andhra Pradesh, NTR filled up the political vacuum and created an alternative to the Congress. Gradually the party went into a control of the present Chief Minister who is willing to switch sides in every general election. There is no second line of leadership and the option offered is of “a coalition of rivals”. The political parties in question also pay a price. The only leaders who have a political future are the ones which are acceptable to the leaders of the dynastic parties. You fall foul of the family, you are thrown out of the party or marginalised. Talent has no space. Merit is no virtue. Organisational structure need not exist. The charisma of the family alone is the party’s vote bank. The crowd around the family is the cadre. This model, however, has one significant weakness. Strength of the party is co-existent with the strength of the current generation of the dynasty. If he is found to be non-inspirational or inadequate in leadership, the party has to throw all its eggs in an incomplete basket. The basket may be worth only 44 Lok Sabha seats, at times slightly less; at times slightly more. The ill-informed reactions of the leader become the new ideology. The silver lining, however, is that India is changing. It has very large middle class and very strong aspirational class aspiring to get into the middle classes. This aspirational India judges parties and leaders very harshly. They don’t accept whoever is imposed. They ask difficult and penetrating questions and their yardstick is very tough. They look for leaders of integrity, they look for men and women who can inspire them, who are decisive and can lead the nation. To them surnames don’t matter – competence and capacity does. The real strength of Indian democracy would be when the charismas of some families is completely shattered and parties, through a democratic process, throw up leaders of merit and competence. This was more than adequately proved in 2014 where most dynastic parties lost miserably. India of 2019 is different from India of 1971. If the Congress Party wants the 2019 elections to be between Prime Minister Modi, who is the son of lesser known parents and someone who is known only for his parentage rather than capacity, merit and competence, the BJP would gladly accept the challenge. Let this be the agenda for 2019. :   Firstpost",2018-11-27,"Arjun Jaitley Blog,Arun Jaitley,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Father,Jawaharlal Nehru,Mother,Narendra Modi,Prime Minister,Rahul Gandhi,Sonia Gandhi,TheySaidIt,Vilas Muttemwar",'What was the name of Sardar Patel's father?' asks Arun Jaitley in Facebook blog post hitting out at Congress,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/what-was-the-name-of-sardar-patels-father-asks-arun-jaitley-in-his-facebook-blog-hitting-out-at-congress-5624991.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sandip Ghose,"  *** Driving into Kota, one sees a statue of Rajiv Gandhi sitting on a rock with a laptop computer. Most likely inspired by Rodin’s famous sculpture of the 'Thinker' it is ironic at various levels. Tucked away in the south-east corner of Rajasthan, is the closest Indian comparison one can draw with University towns of the West. But, that would still be a huge stretch of imagination. Kota is not a modern-day Nalanda. It does not have a famous university. If education can be described as an industry, Kota is what Detroit used to be for automobiles in the US. Kota’s   out over 150,000 students each year for engineering and medical college entrance examinations. The city’s economy revolves around the coaching industry that had an estimated turnover Rs 1,500 crores in 2016. Now, it may well have crossed the Rs 3,000 crore-mark. The coaching tycoons of Kota are the new Maharajah-s. Understandably, they wield huge political clout. But, the erstwhile royals of Kota, or Kotah as it was called, are also in the news these days. Meanwhile, as one enters the town, numerous billboards of a beaming Shanti Dhariwal, the local Congress heavyweight, greet us. In contrast, BJP’s presence on the city skyline is muted. This can be partly attributed to the late declaration of candidates by BJP. Shanti Dhariwal has old roots in Kota. He was a senior minister in the Ashok Gehlot cabinet, but lost the last election due to the Narendra Modi wave. His contributions to the development of the city are well-recognised. Among his many notable achievements is the construction of Kota’s star tourist attraction – the “seven Wonders Park”. Yet, people are not entirely sure of his win this time. The answer to that lies in the underlying cross-currents and infighting within the various factions of the Congress. Congress faced a minor revolt after the party released its candidate list in Rajasthan. But, so did the BJP. The difference, people pointed out, is when the prospects of victory are higher loss of ticket hurts more. The mood in Congress is more buoyant at this time as those left out have greater angst than the ones in BJP who may be secretly viewing it as a blessing in disguise. My local associate insisted that I drop by at the residence of the Kota Royalty Brijraj Bhawan. The courtyard was bustling with party workers wearing BJP scarves. Just a couple of days back the crowd here were donning the Congress colours. In a swift last-minute move, the chief minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje won over the royal scion  , Kalpana Raje. Singh was the former Congress MP from Kota-Bundi. The family was miffed at the party choosing the wife of the Congress leader Naimuddin Guddu over her. Even a month ago Ijyaraj featured prominently in Congress communication. He was seen receiving Rahul Gandhi when he visited Kota to address an election rally in late October. He is yet to remove the pictures from his Facebook page at the time of writing. This is being seen as a coup of sorts. While Kalpana Raje will mobilse the Hindu votes in her constituency, being the ex-royal and former MP, Ijyaraj Singh has considerable appeal in the larger Kota area. Besides, he is expected to neutralise whatever gains Congress hopes to derive from Manvendra Singh by campaigning across the region, including Raje’s constituency Jhalawar. More importantly   would help to assuage the Rajput lobby, which was a trifle cut up with Vasundhara. I was ushered in to the make shift office in the outhouse. One is always a bit wary of meeting politicians at election time. But, I was pleasantly surprised by the Maharao who wore none of the characteristic arrogance of politicians or typical airs of royalty. The two together can make a lethal combination as one has seen in other politician princes and princesses. Ijyaraj appeared almost like a reluctant politician. That might be because he was yet to fully adjust to the new saffron livery. Kalpana Raje was campaigning in her constituency, while the Prince was managing the back office from home. But, clearly the Brijraj Bhavan was the centre of action. Talking about the mood of the electorate, Ijyaraj sounded circumspect. But, when mildly provoked by saying he was not sounding very enthusiastic — he quickly recovered to assert, we are very confident about our constituency but have to see what is happening around us. This is the common refrain one hears around the state. One can interpret either as a brave façade or cautious optimism. But, it does reinforce the impression that it is a much closer contest now than it appeared to be some time ago. Undoubtedly, the BJP’s stock has risen significantly in the past few weeks. Much of the credit for that has to go to Vasundhara Raje’s deft chess play. Kota falls in the Hadoti region of Rajasthan comprising the districts of Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar along with it. Nourished by the Chambal it is the relatively more fecund part of the state. Kota’s Seth Bhamashah Mandi is one of the largest in the country. It trades in cotton, millet, wheat, coriander, garlic and oilseeds. Industries are few. Among the handful of larger units are thermal power, fertiliser and caustic soda plants. Other than that, stone polishing, traditional textiles, cotton and oil seed milling are the only ones of significance. The Coaching Institutes have largely provided jobs to educated professionals coming from all over the country. The large student population has no doubt boosted the urban economy but has not done much for the rural areas. Therefore, the region remains primarily dependent on agriculture. And, there is the rub. Unlike other parts of Rajasthan, here the angst in Hadoti is directed at the Centre. Policies. Demonetisation and GST are the popular culprits but come with a twist. Traders, I met, were generally appreciative of demonetisation as a “one time” medicine for capturing black money. But, what they did not bargain for is the transparency and digitisation it would lead to. How can business be conducted entirely in “white”, one asked in all innocence. Similarly, GST is universally acknowledged as a good reform the time for which had come. However, they blame the government for not thinking through the implementation and the increase in bureaucracy. A dealer told me, “big companies have the staff to file returns. Whereas for us, we have to do everything. Where do we have the time? Why couldn’t they make the compliance quarterly instead of monthly?” But, they are lenient on Narendra Modi. The intentions of the prime minister are good ( ) but he was misled and let down by the ministers and the bureaucracy, they felt. Here, surprisingly the name of Piyush Goyal comes up. One person says, someone like Goyal would have understood the pains of the traders better. He refers to some of the “trader friendly” decisions taken during Goyal’s temporary stint in the Finance Ministry. Somewhat surprisingly, central government schemes like PMAY and Ujjwala are not much talked about. The much touted Smart City project, in which Kota was selected as one, has not taken off.The emphasis has been more on state government programmes. So, Vasundhara Raje remains popular. The Jaipur-Jhalawar highway has earned her huge kudos. With Udaipur already well connected with Kota, the region has become far more accessible. This has no doubt contributed to development and prosperity. The proposed airport in Jhalawar, which will also serve the adjoining areas of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, will be a major boon since at present railways form the principal lifeline. Thus, at the end of the day, much as they might vent their frustration with the BJP government the loyal voters may still press the Lotus button on the EVMs. The Express-way to Jaipur from Kota is a pleasure to drive on. Hotel Sheetal Tonk is one of the few places to stop for a bite and comfort break. This is where BJP’s wild card candidate, Yunus Khan, is camping with his troupes. Khan's  , perhaps, was a “googly” bowled by Raje in this election. The import of Raje’s decision is yet to fully sink into the political class outside the constituency. But, BJP Karyakartas in Tonk see this as a master stroke with fair chances of success. In the normal course, the minority votes would have naturally veered towards Congress. Everyone is eagerly waiting to see if Khan’s entry is going to queer the pitch. With BJP’s gamble on the SC/ST act Khan may also garner some of the backward class votes. Another factor that might work in Khan’s favour is that, he is seen as a candidate parachuted in to Tonk with a mission. Otherwise, he would have surely won from his home constituency Didwana.. Irrespective of the outcome, Khan will move out of Tonk before the next elections leaving the turf for the old BJP leaders. On the other hand, Pilot is viewed as a threat by the local Congress leadership. If he wins, then he is likely to make Tonk his home constituency. That will not quite please the minority community leaders who were till now ruling the roost. Though Pilot may still pull it off, it will not be a walkover for him as many had expected. Herein lies the importance of Vasundhara Raje Scindia – the strategist. Her own stakes in these polls are arguably the highest. If Sachin Pilot loses the war, he is young enough to wait for fighting another day. Ashok Gehlot has seen and done it all. He would be happy to play Rahul Gandhi’s Chanakya in Delhi. Modi and Amit Shah will move onto the bigger battle for Delhi. But, for Vasundhara a defeat could mean a long term political setback. Under these circumstances, Raje has played her cards brilliantly. First, she has unquestionably   for BJP as far as Rajasthan goes. This is reflected in how she had her way in distribution of tickets to her loyalists and now got RSS to throw its weight behind her. Secondly, she has repaired bridges with different caste blocs in the state. But, her biggest achievement has been in spreading disarray in the ranks of the Congress. She has brought BJP back into the race from great odds. Now, with a little help from Modi in the slog overs, when he is supposed to address 10 rallies, she might break the Jaipur jinx and come back for a second consecutive term.",2018-11-27,"Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,Bharatiya Janata Party,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Demonetisation,GST,Narendra Modi,PoliticsOnTheGo,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2019,Rajasthan Polls,Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha 2019,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha polls: From caste equations to tickets, Vasundhara Raje played her hand brilliantly",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-vidhan-sabha-polls-from-caste-equations-to-tickets-embattled-vasundhara-raje-has-played-her-hand-brilliantly-5623441.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya Pal Malik has purportedly said he would have made People's Conference chairman Sajad Lone the chief minister of the state had he listened to instructions from the Centre. A video has surfaced in the media in which Malik can purportedly be heard making the remarks, another   after the controversy over a supposedly non-functional fax machine last week. On 21 November, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had sent an official communique to the Raj Bhawan via fax, staking claim to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir in alliance with the Congress and National Conference. She later tweeted saying that her fax was not going through to the governor's office in Jammu, and thus she was making their decision public as a last resort to reach out to Malik. Soon after Mehbooba's claim, Lone also claimed he had tried to send his letter to the governor staking claim to form the government — with the support of BJP MLAs — via fax, but after receiving no response, he said he sent a copy of the letter to Malik's personal assistant on WhatsApp and shared a screenshot of the same. Not long after Mehbooba and Lone's claims, Malilk announced his decision to dissolve the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly. The next day, in  , Malik had claimed he had not received either letter as it was a holiday at the Raj Bhawan on account of Eid, and there was no one to man the fax machine. Malik reportedly made the statement about making Lone the chief minister at a public gathering on 24 November in Gwalior. Responding to a query on the turn of events, Malik said he believed he had done the ""right thing"" as he did not want to go down in history as a ""dishonest man"". Speaking to  on Tuesday after the video of him making the remarks surfaced, Malik claimed there was no political pressure on him or any interference from the Centre in the affairs of Jammu and Kashmir, and that his decision was ""completely apolitical"". He reiterated that the sole intention behind his decision to dissolve the Assembly was to ensure that Jammu and Kashmir gets a ""stable and elected government"".  he did not want any ""hanky panky, underhand... defection. ""Let them go to the polls, ... I want the people to decide who they want to form the government,"" he said, while avoiding questions on his purported statements from the video. The governor also claimed that Mehbooba had never called him even though he his ""always available on call"", and that Lone had sent his letter to the personal assistant of the previous governor instead. He said he did not receive any list of supporting MLAs from either side staking claim to form the government until Mehbooba went public with the development the next day. ""I was convinced that none of the parties had the numbers. They would have only indulged in horsetrading,"" Malik said. Since the   on 19 June, Jammu and Kashmir has been under Governor's Rule.

Joseph Lalrintluanga," When the first wine shop in Aizawl opened up on 16 March, 2015 after a period of 18 years, people queued up soon after to get their hands on legally sold whiskey and rum. The ban on alcohol sale in the hill state that came into force with the Mizoram Liquor Total Prohibition Act of 1995 was lifted by the Congress government by introducing the Mizoram Liquor Prohibition and Control Act (MLPC) 2014. Three years down the line, as the 7.68 lakh voters of the state prepare to elect the members to the next state Assembly on 28 November, the fate of alcohol seems to be a crucial factor that could influence the outcome. Among the parties in the forefront are the ruling Congress, the Mizo National Front (MNF) and the Zoram Peoples' Movement (ZPM). The Congress is seeking a third term, while the main opposition, MNF, vows to brush aside the Lal Thanhawla-led government. After the MLPC Act 2014 replaced the Total Prohibition Act, three wine shops were opened in Aizawl, which were run by state-owned corporations, namely Zoram Industrial Development Corporation (ZIDCO), Mizoram Food and Allied Industries Corporation Ltd. (MIFCO) and Mizoram Agricultural Marketing Corporation Limited (MAMCO). According to a ZIDCO official, Zoa, the average alcohol sales every day for almost five months amounted to Rs 8 lakh. Going by this figure, the state exchequer made Rs 2.40 crore from alcohol sales in a month on an average for the first few months. The MNF, however, is promising a complete ban on alcohol if they win the elections, citing its bad influence on the society and painting the legal sale re-introduced by the Congress as a sinful attempt at garnering votes. The talk of the town in Aizawl is that if one wants to have quality spirits for another five years, they must vote Congress. But, if one is happy drinking low-quality liquor at exorbitant prices, they may go with the MNF. Liansuama, one of MNF's advisors, said that if MNF wins the elections this time, total prohibition will be implemented as soon as possible. “People struggling with drug and alcohol addiction will be delivered from their bondage of sins through the services of NGOs and church efforts,"" he said. Meanwhile, the largest Christian organisation, the Presbyterian Church's Social Front, which studied the effects of alcohol in society, issued a 42-page report last year. It found that alcohol-related deaths in Mizoram had increased after lifting the prohibition. The survey said that alcohol-related deaths in Aizawl's four hospitals accounted for 16.32 percent of the total deaths. The survey interviewed 873 people, in which 93.81 percent believed that alcohol causes a ""negative impact on society"", while 63 percent people wanted total prohibition of liquor. Reverend F Lalrinnunga, chairman of Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee (all-Churches organisation) says, ""As members of the Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee (MKHC) we don't have anything to say about prohibition."" He adds that the biggest church in Mizoram, the Presbyterian Church Synod, had appealed to the government not to lift the prohibition, but failed in its attempt. State BJP president JV Hluna says that if they win the election and form a government, they will stop all liquor imports from other states, but will encourage locally-made liquor. Lallianchhunga adds that, as a party, they will have no hesitation in lifting the MLPC Act and reinstating the prohibition. But that would be after careful consultation with party workers and the church bodies, and only after going through the results of a study conducted by the state government, he said. Meanwhile, alcohol vendors and suppliers, who have invested lots of money in the industry, are worried about the outcome of the elections. If the ruling Congress loses the battle, it will mean the end of their high-yielding three-year business. V Lalliantluanga, a liquor vendor in Aizawl, says that if the Congress does not win the elections this time, and if the alcohol ban comes into effect, he'll have to look for a new job, along with several others in the industry. To purchase alcohol in the state, one would need a liquor permit, which is issued by the Excise and the Narcotics Department. This liquor permit puts a strict limit on alcohol, allowing only six bottles of hard liquor and 10 bottles of wine and beer for “personal bonafide consumption”. Those who visit the state can purchase alcohol by furnishing their inner-line permit. The excise department's website reveals that alcohol-related deaths went up from 22 in 2016 to 59 in 2017. However, a high-ranking official from the department said that the sale of alcohol has gone down tremendously in the past year, which means that people are now more aware of their health and spending. “As a society, we have learned how to drink more responsibly,” he said. Now, there are 48 liquor shops in Mizoram. The proceeds from the alcohol business are one of the main sources of revenue to the state government. In the latest report obtained from the department during the past financial year (April 2017 to March 2018), the revenue received under the MLPC Act was Rs 65.68 crore, surpassing the target of Rs 51.5 crore for the year.",2018-11-27,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Lal Thanhawla,Mizo National Front,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Presbyterian Church,Zoram People's Movement",Mizoram Vidhan Sabha polls: Alcohol traders drink to a Congress win as MNF threatens revenues with a five-year-long dry day,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-vidhan-sabha-polls-alcohol-traders-drink-to-a-congress-win-as-mnf-threatens-revenues-with-a-five-year-long-dry-day-5625521.html,firstpost,-1,0

Responding to a question regarding criticism of his decision to visit Pakistan, Sidhu said, ""I forgive those who criticised me."" ""I have been a fan of Imran Khan since I was a child,"" Sidhu said as he joked and recited verses in Punjabi. Kartarpur is located in Shakargarh in Narowal district of Pakistan's Punjab province.

Sreemoy Talukdar,"Omar Abdullah has wondered aloud on Twitter whether there are BJP sleeper cells inside Congress that become activated ahead of the elections to undermine Congress chances. The National Conference chief was reacting to the Congress' personal attacks on the prime minister's parents. Narendra Modi’s father passed away 30 years ago. His nonagenarian mother lives a quiet, simple life. She remains far away from politics. The references to Modi's parents during the election campaign indicate the paucity of imagination within Congress ranks and a sense of frustration at the lack of real issues with which to target the prime minister. It also exposes the hypocrisy of Rahul Gandhi's ' ' and his shortsightedness as a leader. The easiest way to hand campaign momentum to Modi is to launch personal attacks against him, target his caste, his past vocation of selling tea or his parents. That the Congress hasn’t learnt its lesson despite repeated setbacks points to a lack of leadership at the highest level. The buck stops with the party president. Last Thursday, while addressing a rally in the city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh that goes to polls on 28 November, Congress leader Raj Babbar compared the fall in rupee's value with  . In a video that has since gone viral, Congress leader Vilasrao Muttemwar is seen purportedly  , stating, ""The world knows who the father of Rahul was, who the grandmother of Rahul was, but nobody knows the name of Modi's father."" These remarks are not made by the Congress rank and file. Babbar is a senior leader and the chief of the party’s Uttar Pradesh unit. Muttemwar is a former Minister of State. To date, Rahul has not publicly condemned these statements or posted a tweet distancing his party from these remarks, creating space for Modi to exploit. The prime minister has blamed Rahul for tacitly supporting these remarks. Addressing a rally in Madhya Pradesh's Vidisha on Sunday,  , ""The Congress is running out of steam in this election, so it has started dragging my parents into politics. No Congressman would make such a statement against me or my family without the consent of the party president (Rahul). It is the   (dynast) who is making his leaders speak against me."" Opposition leaders and critics have accused Modi of hypocrisy, pointing out that he has criticised Rahul's parents in the past as well. This is a case of false equivalence. As holders of public office, Rahul's grandparents were open to criticisms of their work, and their contribution to politics and India's development since Independence is subject to public scrutiny. This criticism —   — cannot be compared to Congress' attacks on Modi's parents who never held public offices and has/had nothing to do with politics. Modi is not one to let slip the opportunity. He pointed out that his ""mother sits in her house, performing religious rites, confining herself to a room, and has never visited Madhya Pradesh. She does not even know the R of   (politics)"". He noted, ""Yesterday, they took the name of my mother and now my father. The Congress chief is behind this...   alleges that the prime minister takes the names of his family members. Yes, I have to take their names as they were in politics, unlike my family members who sit quietly in their home and do their job… Had my parents held any public post, they should also have been criticised."" If private citizens are to be made into political targets, then it does seem that the Congress lacks real issues with which to work. Modi has a point here. Now compare the Congress' bungled communication strategy with that of the BJP. The prime minister on Sunday turned the spotlight on the Supreme Court's stance regarding the Ayodhya title dispute, and suggested that the judiciary's reluctance to take up the case has something to do with the pressure that Congress has brought to bear even on judges of the Supreme Court. Speaking to the public in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, Modi on Sunday said, ""Whenever any Supreme Court judge wants to hear the Ram temple case, the Congress' Rajya Sabha lawyer used the threat of impeachment to 'scare' judges."" He was referring to the impeachment motion brought by Congress-led Opposition against former CJI Dipak Misra. ""This is a dangerous game. Congress has no faith in the judiciary. They are working to scare judiciary on the grounds of their numbers in the Rajya Sabha but I we will not let this happen in the temple of democracy. I would also like to tell judges not to be afraid and keep going on the path of justice,""  . As the clamour for a Ram temple in Ayodhya gathers momentum in the Hindi heartland, Modi has sought to turn the focus on election campaign to the trending topic, lent tacit backing to the movement, accused the Congress of delaying tactics and tied the judiciary’s reluctance on hearing the case with the impeachment motion that was moved by the Congress. There will be debates on the veracity of Modi's claims, but it is a superior communication strategy compared to the one where self-claimed ""messengers of love"" in politics are caught targeting the parents of their political rivals. Rahul needs to head to the drawing board.",2018-11-26,"BJP,Congress,Dipak Misra,InMyOpinion,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Narendra Modi,Omar Abdullah,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Vidhan Sabha Elections",Rahul Gandhi’s Congress has perfected art of handing campaign momentum over to Narendra Modi,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhis-congress-has-perfected-art-of-handing-campaign-momentum-over-to-narendra-modi-5618621.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The ruling CPI(M) in Kerala on Monday suspended its Shoranur MLA, PK Sasi, against whom sexual harassment charges were levelled by a woman party worker, for six months from the party's primary membership. The decision in this regard was taken at the CPI(M) state committee meeting at AKG Centre, the party headquarters in Kerala. The Left party, in a release, said Sasi was suspended from the CPI(M)'s primary membership for six months after it was found that he had conversed with a woman worker ""in a manner not befitting a party leader"". The decision will be implemented after getting the ratification from the party's central committee, the release said. A woman Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) leader had accused Sasi of trying to sexually abuse her following which the party had initiated a probe. A two-member party appointed commission, comprising law minister, A K Balan, and Kannur MP and central committee member P K Sreemathy, which probed the allegations had in its report stated that Sasi had not sexually assaulted the complainant, but had conversed with her inappropriately. Sasi, Palakkad district secretariat member, who had earlier dismissed the allegation against him saying it was a ""well planned conspiracy"" to malign him politically, Monday 
said he would accept any decision the CPI(M) took against him and would always remain with the party. According to media reports, the DYFI leader had filed the complaint alleging the MLA tried to sexually abuse her at the party office at Manarcaud in Palakkad. The complaint had been sent to CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat on 14 August and via an e-mail to CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury as well.

Armstrong Chanambam and Syed Sajjad Ali," With barely two days left for the 2018 Mizoram Vidhan Sabha election campaign to end, the   has amped up its poll pitch to secure an electoral victory in the only northeastern state where the party or its allies are not in power. Interestingly, the saffron party has entrusted its Tripura unit to woo voters from different constituencies in Mizoram. Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb — one of the star campaigners for the BJP — has visited Mizoram several times over the past one month. According to a member of the Tripura BJP who was stationed in Mizoram two months ago in the run-up to the polls, the Tripura unit was initially responsible for preparing the groundwork for the polls in 21 Vidhan Sabha segments. However, it is now officially working on five Vidhan Sabha constituencies in Mizoram — Hachhek, Dampa, Mamit, West Tuipui, and Tuichawng. Borrowing a page from Tripura where the party decimated the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front government of 25 years in February, BJP leaders in Mizoram are eager to talk about the “change” their party brought in the neighbouring state. “If we can do it in Tripura, we can oust the Congress in Mizoram as well. Unlike CPM, the Congress in Mizoram is in complete disorder and facing huge anti-incumbency,” said Pratima Bhowmik, general secretary of BJP Tripura. Bhowmik said that she and a few other BJP MLAs are in constant touch with BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor and Assam's finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is the party's election in-charge in Mizoram, and Biplab Kumar Deb. Tripura's social welfare minister Santana Chakma has also been one of the leaders actively taking part in the election campaigns. Bhowmik was among the handful of leaders from Tripura chosen to undertake a hectic campaign in Mizoram and woo voters from smaller and marginalised tribes like Bru, Chakma and Hmar. Stationed at Mamit near the interstate border in Mizoram, Bhowmik is currently engaged in wooing nearly 11,232 registered Bru voters staying in six refugee camps in Tripura. The   have had a tumultuous history of conflict and the 1997 violence razed Mamit district, forcing thousands of Brus, also known as Reangs, to take shelter in Tripura. Over 35,000 Reangs are living in the Kanchanpur makeshift camps in northern Tripura which shares its boundary with Mizoram. Several attempts even by the Ministry of Home Affairs to repatriate them over the past decade have failed. The refugee voters will be eligible to exercise their franchise and choose representatives for three constituencies in Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei district. Like other years, the Election Commission has made special arrangements allowing them to vote in one polling station at Kanhmun, inside Mizoram. They will be transported to Kanhmun on the morning of 28 November for security purposes and will return to the refugee camps in Tripura on the same day. The minority tribes — which have been fighting long to get recognised and are unhappy with the current state government over alleged prejudice — form a substantial voter base in at least 12 of the 40 Assembly constituencies in Mizoram. The BJP is leaving no stone unturned to benefit from the anti-incumbency and garner support of these refugee voters. On 18 November, Sarma visited some of the refugee camps in Kanchanpur in North Tripura and assured them that his party would intervene to solve their problems. He was scheduled to meet Bhowmik and a group of Bru leaders in Guwahati along with other senior BJP leaders. ""We attended a meeting in Guwahati on 21 November, during which Himanta Biswa Sarma briefed us about how we should go about our poll preparations,” Bhowmik said. Mizoram Congress spokesperson Maliana said the BJP knows they are outsiders in Mizoram and that the people of Mizoram will not vote for them. “BJP is bringing leaders from neighbouring states because they want to mobilise voters from tribes like Brus and Chakmas,” he said. Dr Lalrina, a key leader of the National People’s Party (NPP), said they do not mind if the BJP or the other parties are bringing campaigners from outside. “Despite having various ethnic communities, the North East is united, and no political party should try to divide people.” The NPP, which was launched in poll-bound Mizoram on 28 September, has a strong presence in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Meghalaya — where the party formed the government earlier this year after aligning with BJP and other parties. According to sources, the Tripura BJP members working in Mizoram are confident of delivering in seven of the nine Assembly constituencies where it is unofficially engaged in overseeing the party's poll preparations. While several senior leaders in Mizoram have made tall claims of forming the next government in Mizoram, the source added that party president Amit Shah thought differently. “He (Shah) is aware that the party cannot form the next government. However, we are focussing on having a say in the next government formation by capitalising on the Bru and Chakma voters who could be the deciding factors in nine Assembly segments,” the BJP member said on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, the Mizoram BJP unit dismissed all criticism over outsiders campaigning in the state. ""The practice is not just confined to Mizoram. Wherever and whenever the party needs us, BJP members are there. In fact, I was campaigning for the BJP in Manipur, Tripura, and Meghalaya during the Assembly polls there,"" said VK Hluna, Mizoram BJP president.",2018-11-26,"Assembly Election 2018,Biplab Kumar Deb,BJP,Brus,Chakmas,Himanta Biswa Sarma,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,National People's Party,PoliticalPlay,Ram Madhav,Tripura",Mizoram Vidhan Sabha election: BJP banks on leaders from Tripura to make up for marginal presence in state,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-vidhan-sabha-election-bjp-banks-on-leaders-from-tripura-to-make-up-for-marginal-presence-in-state-5619151.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"With the Supreme Court hardly showing any sense of urgency to resolve the Babri Masjid-Ram Temple issue in Ayodhya, patience among many principal stakeholders is slowly crumbling. On Sunday, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement seeking the deletion of the old English saying 'Justice delayed is justice denied' from textbooks is a testimony to the growing frustration. As a matter of fact, the case has seen far too many adjournments. Bhagwat made no attempt to hide his resentment against the Supreme Court's decision to postpone the case till January when a new bench will take over and then decide on a new hearing date. The apex court earlier this month refused to give the matter an urgent hearing as wished by many associated with Hindutva forces. The fountainhead of the Sangh Parivar, through his words and action, has made his action clear that after keeping quiet for last four years of the Narendra Modi regime he is going to aggressively mobilise support for the Ram temple. Bhagwat also sought the Narendra Modi government's intervention and frame a law for the construction of a Ram temple knowing fully well that the Centre is not quite keen to employ the legislation route although it has just one full working session of Parliament before the country heads for the Lok Sabha elections next year. Even though both the RSS and the Centre are committed to the issue, they are not quite on the same page when it comes to strategy. On earlier occasions, the RSS chief indicated that he was open to views from various quarters on the issue, more so if it comes from the BJP which now rules the country. In this context, his statement “sometimes such pressures (pressure from people to bring legislation for Ram temple) can lend strength to the government” has loaded connotations. The pressure he was referring to was seen on Monday's gathering in Ayodhya where thousands of seers followed a call from the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to decide on a timetable for the construction of a grand Ram temple at the disputed Ramjanabhoomi site. On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi who otherwise has rarely spoken on the Ayodhya issue also spoke at length blasting Congress for engaging in “dangerous game” to somehow delay the hearing in the Supreme Court. It is hard to believe that it's mere coincidence that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also officially released details of the 211-meter tall Ram statute that he intends to build on the banks of river Saryu in Ayodhya. Modi blasted Congress leaders for asking about his caste, for dragging his mother into electoral discourse and asking who his father was before he moved onto the Ayodhya issue and sought to point out how the Congress was playing a “dangerous game” of delaying court hearing. Former Union minister, Congress MP and senior counsel for a Muslim organisation Kapil Sibal had argued in the Supreme Court that hearing on Ram temple be postponed till 15 July 2019. This demand was made to ensure that the hearing comes after the next government takes charge as the issue has political ramifications. Others went to the extent of alleging an agenda behind “hurry” in hearing the case, which was pending there for the last seven years. The political heat around the issue was so intense that Sibal withdrew himself as counsel from the case. But there was a sustained word-to-mouth campaign against the then chief justice Deepak Misra that he wanted to give a verdict on the Ram temple before he retired and the Opposition drew substance from the fact that the chief justice wanted an early hearing on the case. It’s also a fact that Sibal was the architect of the Congress’ move to try and initiate impeachment motion against Justice Misra. Senior Congress leader CP Joshi had questioned Modi and Uma Bharti’s caste and said only Brahmins had right to speak about the Hindu religion. The prime minister's counter came on a day when a large number of sadhus had gathered in Ayodhya. It’s a fact that sadhus come from varied castes and Modi’s statement would appeal to them. Modi’s contention was these leaders were not speaking on their own but they were speaking on the prompting of “namdar” (Congress president Rahul Gandhi). Officially Ram temple is not on BJP’s agenda in this round of Assembly elections in the five states but emerging narrative around Ayodhya may leave some mark among a section of Hindu voters.",2018-11-26,"Assembly Election 2018,Ayodhya,BJP,Congress,Kapil Sibal,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Ram Temple",'Make law for Ram Mandir': RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ups the ante on Narendra Modi govt as SC holds firm,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/make-law-for-ram-mandir-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-ups-the-ante-on-narendra-modi-govt-as-sc-holds-firm-5618611.html,firstpost,-1,0
Asian News International," Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Uma Bharti said that her party does not have a patent on the Ram temple while calling for all parties to come together to build the temple in Ayodhya. Speaking to reporters, Bharti commended Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for visiting Ayodhya and pressing for the construction of the temple. ""Yes, I appreciate Uddhav Thackeray for his effort. BJP doesn't have a patent on Ram temple, Lord Ram belongs to everyone. I appeal to everyone including Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Akali Dal, Asaduddin Owaisi, Azam Khan and others to come forward and support the construction of the temple,"" the BJP leader said. Thackeray, who was on a visit to Ayodhya over the weekend, reiterated his demand for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and asked the BJP-led central government not to play with the sentiments of the Hindus. At a mega event, Thackeray added that the BJP should apologise and tell people that the Ram temple issue is their 'chunavi jumla' (election gimmick). Amid growing chorus for the construction of a Lord Ram temple, many political parties and spiritual leaders have demanded that an ordinance should be brought in. The Supreme Court, on 29 October, had adjourned the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit till January 2019 to fix the next hearing date in the matter, challenging the Allahabad High Court ruling of 2010. The Allahabad High Court in its 2010 verdict had suggested a division of the disputed land in Ayodhya — one for each of the parties the Nirmohi Akhara, the Sunni Waqf Board and Ram Lalla.

Press Trust of India," The NDA government's handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir in an ad-hoc and experimental manner has pushed the state several years back, former chief minister Omar Abdullah said on Monday. After a hectic political week, Abdullah feels that the BJP is yet to answer many questions, including ""why it entered an alliance with the PDP and why it withdrew all of a sudden?"" Another question which the people of the state will definitely be asking is why despite having 26 MLAs, the BJP decided to lend support to a two-member party (led by Sajjad Lone), he said. With his National Conference already into election mode, Abdullah criticised the BJP over its handling of the political turmoil in Kashmir. ""Keeping in mind the 2019 elections, the BJP keeps changing its goalposts, confusing people. They have pushed the state several years back,"" he claimed. Commenting on the alliance of 'conflicting and contrasting' ideologies, Abdullah said, ""When the BJP and the PDP united, it was stated that the north pole and the south pole had come together and an 'Agenda of Alliance' had been stitched. Has any of the promises been fulfilled by them? Now see what has happened in Jammu and Kashmir... Look at the present political crisis in the state."" ""Forget about initiating talks with Pakistan, they refuse to hold a dialogue with separatists,"" he said. About the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Abdullah said, ""In 2011 or 2012, there was a talk about AFSPA's withdrawal from some areas, as peace had returned. But, can we say that today. The footprint of the Army and para-military forces has doubled from where we left in 2014, only because all types of experiments were carried out in Kashmir and all of them failed."" The vice president of the National Conference reiterated his views on the ""unceremonious"" dissolution of the state Assembly by Governor Satya Pal Malik on 21 November. ""Till a few days ago, the governor wanted to keep the Assembly alive. Overnight, it changed only because the PDP staked claim to form a government with the help of the Congress and my party,"" he said. ""Within no time, the BJP and its proxies pulled out their weapon of mass destruction – Pakistan. We were accused of attempting to form a government at the behest of Pakistan. Can you beat it? Can someone ask them (the BJP) how did Mehbooba ji turn into a Pakistani suddenly when barely five months ago she was their alliance chief minister?"" he said. For the BJP, it seems my-way-or-highway policy but they need to be reminded that India is a democratic country, he added. ""The BJP had swept the Jammu region in previous Assembly elections but today, they stand exposed. They will have to do a lot of answering this time. And one should not forget (to ask) why was the assembly kept in suspended animation. Was it done to allow Lone to keep on poaching MLAs from other parties, either with money or by threatening to open cases using the NIA and the CBI,"" he added. Asked about the Twitter spat with BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav, Abdullah said, ""Look I'm a fairly thick-skinned person when I need to be... if he (Madhav) had challenged my patriotism, I would have cared two hoots for his utterances. I don't need anyone's certificate about my patriotism, nor will I ever be pressured into wearing it on my sleeves. ""But the question was about my workers, nearly 3,000 of them, who have been targeted by Pakistani terror groups only because they refuse to join an anti-India bandwagon. These people died because we held on to the flag of the nation as soldiers do with the only difference being that my colleagues had no weapons to defend themselves with."" Abdullah also drew attention to media reports that quoted senior BJP leader Seshadri Chari about a meeting he had with the NC leader in London, saying he had rejected the idea of forming a government with the BJP even then. About Madhav's tweets, Chari was quoted by a web portal as saying, ""If somebody decides to be a political novice, we can do nothing about it."" However, he had said that it was not the party's official stand. To a question on a possible alliance with the Congress at a time when the National Conference has been favouring a single-party rule, Abdullah said, ""Yes, I would wish to have a single-party rule as there have been coalition governments since 2002. But having said that, let me make it clear that it's my opinion and I am yet to consult my senior party colleagues."" ""I need to consult them before arriving at a final decision,"" he said, and added with a smile, ""our party works democratically"". Asked whether a third front led by Lone would be a force to reckon with in the forthcoming elections, he said, ""Let us see. Let the Centre first announce dates for the Assembly elections.""",2018-11-26,"Assembly,BJP,Jammu And Kashmir,NDA,NewsTracker,Omar Abdullah,PDP,Ram Madhav,Sajjad Lone","BJP keeps changing goalposts and confusing people, says Omar Abdullah; claims party has pushed J&K back several years",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-keeps-changing-goalposts-and-confusing-people-says-omar-abdullah-claims-party-has-pushed-jk-back-several-years-5618741.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sandipan Sharma,"Driving on the 250-kilometre Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway that runs through the Thar Desert, you will come across some fascinating names for villages. There is an entire family of them, literally, with names like Baap (father), Chacha (uncle), Kudi (Punjabi for girl), Jhootha (liar), Gelawas (abode of idiots), Lathi (stick), Dechu (the onomatopoeic cry of donkeys) and Suwar (pig). Legend has it that these painful names are a result of Brahminical conspiracy. When the literati of the area wanted to malign a group of people, they chose the most absurd names for their villages. And, tragically, the names got stuck in popular culture and revenue records. Some of the villagers actually corrected the historical wrongs by going global, literally. A bunch of them rechristened their settlement as America, a name they chose to replace the original, which is considered both unmentionable—thus unprintable—and unlucky. In a region where the names are so fascinating and intriguing, the political talk is even more entertaining and conspiratorial. There are complicated plots— ; subplots—Jats vs Rajputs, Muslims vs Meghwals; side stories of revenge—Manvendra Singh vs Vasundhara Raje; and the engrossing narrative of one faith competing against the other through its fakirs and gurus. In essence, the politics of Barmer-Jaisalmer is a typical potboiler with all the essential ingredients of Indian polity. This is, perhaps, one of the few regions in India where the so-called upper castes—Brahmins and traders—are a minority. The population in these two districts is dominated by Rajputs, Muslims, Jats and Meghwals (a Scheduled Caste). The reason is simple: The hard terrain sustains only those willing to work hard in the fields or rear cattle. For the rest, this is an inclement terrain. These four communities—Muslims, Jats, Rajputs and Meghwals—thus decide the outcome of almost every election. If any three of them unite, they contribute to a clean sweep by a party. If there is a vertical split, it leads to a close contest, which is what is unfolding in the 2018 Assembly elections. There are nine Vidhan Sabha seats in Barmer-Jaisalmer. On each one of them, Rajputs, Jats, Muslims and Meghwals are fighting with each other for every vote, giving the Congress and the BJP a fair shot at most of the seats. And, this close fight is a fascinating denouement of the drama of caste politics that played out in what is referred to by the Indian army as India’s western theatre. The best laid plans of politicians often go awry. For five years, starting with the marginalisation of Jaswant Singh, the BJP wooed the Jats of Marwar (western Rajasthan). To its shock and surprise, it is now watching a third player—local Jat heavyweight  —snare a large number of Jat votes. The Congress, concerned by the BJP carrot for Jats, tried to lasso the rival Rajputs. It even managed to pocket Manvendra Singh, son of Jaswant Singh and scion of the most influential Rajput family in the region, before the elections. However, Rajputs are not expected to desert the BJP altogether, bound by their decade-old loyalty to the party. To the discomfiture of the Congress, some Jats are now supporting the BJP because of the party’s coquettish  . So, the BJP tried to attract Jats, who ultimately turned out to be “disloyal” and joined Beniwal. The Congress tried to woo Rajputs, who after pledging fealty, went back to the BJP. As a result, both parties are wary of the result. Caste, as you can surmise, is the king here. There is ideology, poll philosophy or chemistry. The only factor that’s going to decide the outcome is arithmetic. Some of it works against the Congress because of former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, whom the Jats do not want to see as the next chief minister. Marwar is Gehlot’s backyard, so the political envy against him works the maximum here. The BJP is trying to address both caste and Hindutva factors. It is sending Narendra Modi, Yogi Adityanath, Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah in waves to tap their core constituencies—Hindus and Rajputs. Meanwhile, chief minister Vasundhara Raje is focusing her energies on Jats. The defining feature of the BJP’s campaign is the reluctance of its top brass to seek votes in the name of the chief minister. Modi is going around citing his own achievements and asking voters to support him and destroy the naamdaris and exponents of Raag Darbari who malign him, his government and his lineage. In his 30-minute speeches, embellished with his own name, he refers to Raje just once or twice, that too at the end. It is a clear sign that the BJP is afraid of anti-incumbency.

FP Staff,"The polls in Mizoram on 28 November will see 209 candidates fight it out for the 40 Vidhan Sabha seats. While the Congress and the Mizo National Front (MNF) have fielded 40 candidates each, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has nominated 39 candidates. Like the previous elections, women voters, once again, outnumber the men in Mizoram. In the electorate of 768,181 voters, 393,685 are women and 374,496 are men. Here's a look at how the people of Mizoram voted in the last two Vidhan Sabha elections: The Congress, which is currently battling anti-incumbency and infighting in Mizoram, has ruled the state for a decade now. In the 2013 election, the Congress won 34 of the 40 seats in the Assembly. The MNF, which had fielded candidates from 31 constituencies, had bagged five seats, and the Mizoram People's Conference (MPC) got one. In the 2008 election, the Congress won 32 seats, while the MNF won only three, the MPC won two , the Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP) won two, and the Maraland Democratic Front (MDF) bagged one. In the seven elections held since Mizoram was formed, the BJP has never won a single seat. With the   in the 28 November election, one can expect a neck-and-neck contest between the regional party and Congress. If we look at the past two elections, the Congress got hold of the highest number of seats in state Assembly, but the difference in the vote shares between the two was not much. While 2,55,917 voters (44.63 percent of the total) across constituencies voted for the Congress in 2013, the MNF got 1,64,305 votes (28.65 percent) overall. In 2008, the margin was even smaller —  the Congress had captured a total of 1,95,614 (38.89 percent) votes, while the MNF had secured a total of 1,54,132 votes (30.65 percent). Mizoram saw a decent voter turnout in the previous two elections. In 2008, the state recorded a turnout of 82.35 percent, which rose marginally to 83.41 percent in 2013. 
 
While it may be a small state, the election assumes significance in Mizoram since it is the only northeastern state under Congress rule. If the Congress wins once again, Lal Thanhawla is likely to return as the chief minister for a third term and hold the party's fort in the region. In the event of an MNF victory, there is also a likelihood of the BJP getting into a post-poll alliance with the party to be part of the state government.",2018-11-27,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Didyouknow,Lal Thanhawla,Mizo National Front,Mizoram,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Vidhan Sabha,Mizoram Votes,MNF,Mozoram Polls","Mizoram Vidhan Sabha polls: Results from 2008 and 2013 show minor difference in vote share between Congress, MNF",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-vidhan-sabha-polls-results-from-2008-and-2013-show-minor-difference-in-vote-share-between-congress-mnf-5580361.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"Of the 209 candidates in the fray for the Mizoram Vidhan Sabha elections, only 15 are women, according to officials from the state election department. While that's more than doubled from 2013, when only six women candidates ran for office—unfortunately none were successful—the number of women competing for seats amounts to merely seven percent of the total candidates. Even as women voters outnumber the men among the voting population in Mizoram—of the 768,181 voters, there are 393,685 women and 374,496 men—women candidates are still fighting an uphill battle for respect and to be taken seriously, both by the public and the major political parties. According to  in 2017, Vanlalawmpuii Chawngthu became only the second woman to be inducted into the Mizoram Council of Ministers, that too after a gap of nearly 30 years. Lalhlimpuii Hmar, the first woman to shatter that particular glass ceiling in Mizoram, did so in 1987. Chawngthu herself is no stranger to politics, being the daughter of senior Congress leader and former minister C Chawngkunga, who is now the general secretary of the Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee. Which shows how little representation ordinary women have in the corridors of power, despite them exceeding men both academically and in entrepreneurship, according to the report. Indeed, Chawngthu is the only woman among the 40 legislators taking critical decisions on the future of Mizoram,   And this situation isn't likely to change anytime soon: Chawngthu is the only woman to which the ruling Congress gave an election ticket, while the Mizo National Front (MNF)—a regional party set for a showdown the Congress—has not offered a single woman candidate a ticket. Meanwhile, the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM), the new kid on the block, has given tickets to two women and the BJP, which is hoping to make major inroads, has fielded six women candidates, according to the report. However, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla said things in the 'patriarchal Mizo society' are gradually changing. He told  . “There was a time when Mizo women were mainly confined to household work. Now, they are employed everywhere. Every political party has a frontal organisation for women.” However, not all share Thanhawla's enthusiasm.

Press Trust of India," The Congress alleged Monday the ""weak"" Narendra Modi government ""compromised on"" the national security by allowing a ""third party mediation"" in Jammu and Kashmir, days after an ex-Norwegian prime minister's visit to the state. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the policy underlines that only India and Pakistan can hold a mutual discussion on the boundary dispute and accused the central government of violating the country's 71-year-old policy to deal with the issue. ""You must have read in newspapers... I don't want to take his name, I don't disrespect him. But for the first time, Modiji has sent a former prime minister of a third country to J&K to talk with separatists...Why? This question should be asked to him,"" Surjewala told reporters. He was apparently referring to the recent visit of former Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik to Jammu and Kashmir where he met top separatist leaders. Surjewala was replying to a query on Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu's comments on India-Pakistan relations in the context of Pakistan's announcement to develop a corridor to Kartarpur Sahib, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, in that country. Sidhu had said that ""Pakistan would take two steps towards harmony, if India takes one"". ""It has been India's policy that any mediation by a third country is not allowed and that India and Pakistan can talk mutually about their boundary dispute,"" Surjewala said. He said the Modi government ""cannot be expected"" to take a firm step on the national security. ""Unfortunately, for the first time a weak Modi government is in power, which has knelt down before terrorists, extremism and Naxalism. We cannot expect it to take a solid step on the issue of the national security,"" the Congress spokesperson said. He said the prime minister has ""blurred"" the traditional policy of India on Jammu and Kashmir by allowing a former PM of a third country to talk with separatists. ""Today, it's one country's prime minister, tomorrow the US would ask to mediate in Kashmir dispute, then China and Russia would also come. What are you doing? This is a compromise on the national security,"" he said. Asked if Sidhu's comments amounted to his love for Pakistan, Surjewala said, ""Sidhu is the minister of a state and you (media) took up his comment which is not relevant.... not under his jurisdiction"". He said the media should ask the Modi government why a former prime minister of a foreign country was invited for a joint dialogue. India and Pakistan had last week announced that they would develop Kartarpur corridor in their respective areas, linking Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab's Gurdaspur district with the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, is located across the Ravi river in Pakistan and is about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district of Punjab in India. 
Surjewala said the prime minister has not kept his promise of bringing culprits of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack to book. ""Modi had said that he would bring the culprits of the 26/11 terror attack within 24 hours. What happened? Four-and-a half years have been passed (since the BJP came to power). Why this promise was not kept?"" he asked. On 26 November, 2008, 10 terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba attacked Mumbai.

Press Trust of India,"As rival parties fight a bitter poll battle to grab power in this north-eastern hill state, Mizoram's new chief electoral officer (CEO) said the ""biggest challenge"" for him has been to restore public faith in the election process after intense protests by civil society and political groups against his predecessor. Ashish Kundra — who took charge as the new CEO after SB Shashank was removed amid   relief camps to vote from there — has personally visited the bordering Kanhmun village twice after taking charge to oversee the arrangements despite appointing a six-member high-powered team, including an IAS and an IPS officer, for this job. In an interview after taking over on 15 November, Kundra said that the challenge for him was also to ensure that the integrity of the election machinery is not questioned in Mizoram, which will have polling on Wednesday to elect 40 legislators. ""The biggest challenge to begin with was to restore the confidence and trust of the civil society in the institution of the election machinery and to ensure that the integrity of the election machinery is not questioned in the minds of the general electorate,"" he said on-board a chopper travelling from Aizawl to Kanhmun. To handle this issue peacefully, the challenge was to make an arrangement of voting, which is acceptable to both Mizo civil society and Bru refugees, and is also done in a short span of time, Kundra said. ""I interacted with the joint forum of the NGOs soon after taking charge. I interacted with all political parties. Even in Kanhmun village, I interacted with civil society. That created a bit of positivity, which was much required in the given circumstances,"" he added. Declining to comment on decisions made by his predecessor Shashank, Kundra said the series of events that took place in recent times were ""very unfortunate"". ""It is, I think, rather unprecedented. It is also kind of unprecedented that there would be an assault on the election machinery itself, which has been functioning so perfectly for the last so many decades,"" he said. After reaching Kanhmun, which is about 190 kilometres from Aizawl and takes around eight hours by road, Kundra along with his team comprising Additional CEO Krishna Mohan Uppu and Deputy CEO H Lianzela held a series of meetings at a tourist lodge with the six-member team, police and civil society bodies. The team also visited special polling booths, examined the border areas and also went about a kilometre inside Tripura to check the point of getting down from vehicles for the people coming in to vote. Talking about  , Kundra said that 15 special polling booths have been set up for voting by 11,967 Bru refugees, who are part of nine Assembly constituencies in three district of Mizoram. As per the directions of the Election Commission, a special team has been formed under Kumar Abhishek, who has been flown in from Delhi after the crisis, while Assistant Inspector General of Police (Training) Devesh has been made in-charge of security arrangements. The Election Commission overnight airdropped Bhuvanesh Yadav, the Special Secretary of Higher Education to Chhattisgarh government, on Sunday as observer for these 15 booths in view of the sensitivities involved. ""Today is the second time I have visited Kanhmun along with our team. I am perfectly satisfied with the arrangements that have been made to establish the polling stations as directed by the commission. The local community, which is the Young Mizo Association (YMA), has been more than supportive,"" Kundra said. The Mizoram CEO office has arranged transportation for refugees as six camps in the neighbouring state are situated at varying distance of 6-60 km from the border and there is no regular public transport available. Expecting a ""reasonable turnout from the Bru camps"", Kundra said he and his team last week went to the largest camp inside Tripura and interacted with Bru leaders, who were initially reluctant to come to Kanhmun for voting, but later agreed to it as part of a mutually reached solution to the crisis. Talking about general preparedness while on way back to the temporary helipad at Zawlnuam near Kanhmun, Kundra said: ""I have reviewed the preparations across the state. I am confident that the team of district election officers are fully geared up to deliver free, fair and peaceful elections."" Over 11,000 people are involved in this exercise of elections that includes civil administration, polling parties, police personnel and others, he said. Asked about the EVM and VVPAT back-ups, he said: ""We have adequate back-up stocks for any replacements. Usually about 30 percent is back-up, but in some remote areas polling parties are given 100 percent back up also because it is difficult to transport in case of a failure."" During the entire election process, only two show-cause notices have been served — one each to Congress and MNF — for not intimating the administration about the distribution of some pamphlets. For polling on Wednesday, the Election Commission is likely to incur an expenditure of about Rs 30 crore, Kundra said.

Rangoli Agrawal,"Once the Congress announced that its Rajasthan state unit president Sachin Pilot will contest the Vidhan Sabha election from Tonk, the BJP fielded its lone Muslim candidate, Yunus Khan, a cabinet minister in Vasundhara Raje’s government, against him. Pilot sees these elections as a BJP versus Congress contest, giving little weight to regional parties that have come together as a 'third front' in the state. Confident that his party will trump the incumbent BJP in the upcoming elections, Pilot reveals why he shifted from his usual constituency of Ajmer, how his party plans to govern the state if the anti-incumbency wave translates into victory, and why he holds Raje responsible for the current development paralysis in the state. Edited excerpts of the interview follow: 
The situation in Rajasthan has never been so grim as during the five years of the Raje government, with 165 MLAs, and a clear majority at the Centre. Sadly, she took the mandate for granted. The people's core development issues were completely ignored. She made 611 promises, but hardly any of them have been fulfilled. These issues are quite repetitive, but the current agrarian crisis is something the state has never seen before. For the first time in Rajasthan's history, 150 farmers have committed suicide. Joblessness is acute. It is a very young state, we have lot of energy and talent. But four young people killing themselves because of a lack of jobs, is shattering. Raje has betrayed the mandate of Rajasthan. The state is yearning for change. On the other hand, the Congress narrative is positive. We are not just unmasking the faults of the BJP or those who are accountable, but also laying down a five-year plan for Rajasthan to break out of the shackles of debt it is currently facing. 
The agrarian crisis and financial situation of farmers will be resolved. It is not just credit and loans; it is also access to the market, availability of finances and resources. For example, there is an acute urea shortage in Rajasthan. The farming community, as a whole, collapsed, so the ecosystem needs to be revamped. The second issue is young people looking for jobs. When you have the holder of a PhD or a Master’s degree applying for a Category 4 government employee job, it means you are underemployed. Both underemployment and unemployment are problematic issues that we will address. Our manifesto will address many other things too. What we are looking at is not allowing the state to give up all its assets, like Raje has done. She is advertising schools and hospitals under the PPP (public-private partnership) model. If a government cannot provide education and healthcare, it doesn’t deserve to be in power. 
Education is an investment because when you write a cheque for education, you are investing in the future. The returns are much larger than expected because the coming generations get knowledge, wisdom, opportunities and self-confidence. Education decimates social ills. So you are not only investing in young children so they can get jobs, but are also investing in making them better citizens. We are certainly going to restructure what Raje has destroyed, and the emphasis is on education. Why should a government school not be as good as a private school? Why can’t every school be of a Navodaya Vidyalaya or of Kendriya Vidyalaya standard? It is possible but needs some effort. I know history is against us but if the resolve is of steel, and conviction and belief are strong, there is no reason why we can’t have an education system better than anywhere else in the country. 
The schemes themselves are not wrong, but look at the Bhamashah project. The   is actually a failure because it has been taken over by a cartel of corrupt individuals. There are groups formed between hospitals, brokers and individuals. Insurance companies have backed out of the scheme. The programme sounds grand but its implementation is far from satisfactory. BJP is very good at announcing things, changing names and renaming programmes, but implementation is almost zero. There is no delivery. 
Rahul asked me to contest the elections and I left the decision to the party. I am contesting from wherever the Congress felt my candidature provides the greatest benefit. I have gladly accepted the decision. Once we get a majority, the MLAs and Congress will decide who will get charge of which duties. This is the norm. We don't declare chief ministerial faces, we fight elections, get a majority and MLAs elect their leader. This naming of chief ministers and prime ministers is something the Congress doesn't do. 
It has been five years of sustained effort by the party. All our leaders have contributed to it. We have been campaigning for five years. Prakash Javadekar, Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have all discovered Rajasthan recently. They never knew the land existed when there were floods, riots, rapes, murders and mob lynchings. Where were all these senior leaders in these five years? Now that the elections are here, they are all coming to ask for votes. What I have done as party president is to campaign from Day One. I did not want to wait for anti-incumbency to kick in because that's not an asset, it is people's liability. I cannot base my election campaign and narrative on that negativity. To create space in people's hearts and minds takes more than six months, it takes sacrifice. We were arrested, lathi-charged, we held  , rallies,  and everything else we could do to keep the farmers and youth movement going, and we took on the force of the BJP. Despite the BJP having a majority, it couldn't do as it wished. 
Rajasthan is a bipolar state. In every election, there are one or two parties and Independents, but largely it is an election between the Congress and BJP. I don't see this election as any different. There are smaller parties and they have their own space. It's a BJP versus Congress contest, and I don’t see any third, fourth or fifth front coming into the picture and having any lasting impact on the results. They may make headlines and grab news time with catchy statements, but people of the state know it’s the Congress that will win. Voters of Rajasthan are smart, they won't waste their votes for religion or community or any front. These smaller parties have suddenly mushroomed a month before the election; there is no agenda, history or future.",2018-11-26,"BJP,Congress,QandA,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha,Rajasthan Vidhan Sabja Election 2018,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje,Vidhan Sabha Elections 2018,‪Vasundhara Raje‬‬","Vasundhara Raje has betrayed the mandate of Rajasthan, says Sachin Pilot ahead of Vidhan Sabha elections",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vasundhara-raje-has-betrayed-the-mandate-of-rajasthan-says-sachin-pilot-ahead-of-vidhan-sabha-elections-5615661.html,firstpost,-1,0

The prime minister challenged the Congress party to better Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's record of welfare in the state during her five-year term. ""But their previous government's record is so dire, they don't even have the courage to remember Vasundhara ji's record,"" he added. ""When you don't have a record of the work you did, or a vision for the future development of the state, or have an answer for the political rifts within your party, the topic for your election campaign becomes Modi's caste.

Press Trust of India," Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath hit out at Rahul Gandhi over the issue of national security on Saturday, and hinting at the Congress chief's comments on the Rafale deal, said it was hard to guess whether he was speaking in India or Pakistan. Speaking at a rally in Indore's Rau area, Adityanath also attacked Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath over a video that has gone viral and made a veiled reference to the origins of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi with an ""Italy"" jibe. ""The country is setting new records on the security front and has developed its hitting capabilities, due to which we can enter the territories of enemies like China and Pakistan. This is upsetting the Congress,"" he told the gathering. Attacking the Congress chief, Adityanath said, ""You will be surprised at the fake outlook of the Congress. Do you know what Rahul speaks? Sometimes, we cannot guess from his body language whether he is speaking in India or Pakistan."" Gandhi has been attacking the Centre on the Rafale fighter jets deal and has claimed that the aircraft were being bought for prices much higher than what the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had agreed to. The Centre, however, has maintained that the Rafale deal was carried out after following proper norms. Speaking about the video in which Nath is purportedly seen talking about the votes of the Muslim community, Adityanath said, ""You can remain happy with Ali, we have Bajrangbali."" In the video, Nath is purportedly heard saying, ""If the Muslim community does not record a 90 percent voting, we will suffer a heavy blow."" The Congress has, however, dubbed the video as a conspiracy of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to divide voters on communal lines. ""We (BJP) do not discriminate on the basis of the beneficiaries' caste and religion in government schemes. This is Ram Rajya, in which there should be no discrimination against any person on any basis,"" Adityanath said. He alleged that the Congress had turned Hindi-speaking states like Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand into ""Bimaru"" ones. ""Bimaru"" is an acronym for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and has regularly been used by economists and political pundits to signify the ""bimar"" (Hindi for ailing) socio-economic parameters of these states. ""During the Congress rule, there was terrorism in some of these states and Naxalism in some others. Besides, different types of mafia were also active,"" Adityanath alleged. In an apparent reference to Sonia Gandhi's origins, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, without naming anybody, said, ""Some mafias were brought here from Italy by the Congress as dowry."" He also questioned the Congress's pre-poll promise of farm loan waiver, something that has been mentioned by Rahul Gandhi in his election rallies in Madhya Pradesh as well as in other poll-bound states. ""First, the Congress should waive the debts of all farmers in Punjab,"" Adityanath said.

Indo-Asian News Service," President of the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) Shivpal Singh Yadav met Governor of Uttar Pradesh Ram Naik on Sunday and expressed his concern over the ""large and unlawful"" gathering of people in Ayodhya. Emerging out of the meeting, the former state minister said it was a matter of grave concern that despite prohibitory orders, lakhs of people were allowed and even facilitated by the state government to gather in the temple town. He added that this was an attempt by some forces to stoke communal passions that posed a danger to the harmony in Uttar Pradesh as well as that in the nation. Shivpal Yadav, who is the younger brother of Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav, also questioned the silence of the Yogi Adityanath government on the 'Dharma Sabha' being held in Ayodhya by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Sunday. ""A similar situation had arisen in 1992 and it is for everyone to see what happened...the matter is before the Supreme Court and everyone should show patience,"" he said while pointing out that that there was a large stretch of land on the banks of the river Saryu which was under government control and that a Ram temple can be constructed there. ""Why this obstinacy to build a Ram temple at the spot where Babri mosque was razed,"" the PSP(L) leader said. He also warned that the BJP and its affiliates should not do anything that threatened the communal fabric and lead to riots and violence.

Press Trust of India,": With just three days left for the Mizoram Assembly elections, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla on Sunday said the Congress is open to form a post-poll alliance with like-minded parties, excluding the BJP and MNF, if the ruling party falls short of majority. He, however, claimed that such a situation will not arise as the Congress will get full majority on its own. In Mizoram, support of 21 MLAs is needed to form a government in the 40-member Assembly, which is going to polls on 28 November and the counting will take place on 11 December. ""If like-minded parties come to me and want to support my leadership, then they may (be) welcomed,"" Thanhawla told   during an interview when asked if the Congress is willing to form a post-poll alliance if it does not get a simple majority. Asked with whom the Congress is comfortable to form an alliance, he said, ""I don't know at this moment. But certainly not the BJP, certainly not the MNF. Let the time come."" Refusing to predict a number, the senior Congress leader said his party will get a comfortable majority. ""I am quite confident that I will continue to be in power and I will hold the fort for the Congress (in North East). All indications are there,"" he added. Mizoram is significant for the Congress as it remains the only state under the party's rule in the region compared to as many as five just about two years ago, which included Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. Thanhawla said there is no difference in the campaign this time compared to that in previous two terms as big crowds can be seen in party meetings and ""large number"" of people are joining the Congress. When pointed out that senior ministers and political leaders have left the party in the last two months, he said, ""I don't see any worker leaving my party at this stage. But unwanted and corrupt people have left. Congress workers are very grateful and they are much inspired because these corrupt people have left the party."" At least five Congress MLAs have resigned from the Assembly and the party in the run-up to the polls and joined either the BJP or the Mizo National Front (MNF). Those who have resigned include state's Home Minister R Lalzirliana, former Health Minister Lalrinliana Sailo, former Fisheries Minister Buddha Dhan Chakma and MLA Hmingdailova Khiangte. Besides, Mizoram Assembly Speaker Hiphei resigned earlier in November. Asked about anti-incumbency factor as alleged by the Opposition MNF, Thanhawla said, ""Not all. Only MNF is feeling anti-incumbency factor. They don't have anything to point fingers at me - no scandal, no misuse (of funds). How can they say anti-incumbency wind is blowing in Mizoram? It's only their wishful thinking."" On MNF president Zoramthanga's comment that all roads of Mizoram are in ""ICU"", the chief minister said: ""He is a good speaker. His speaks a lot. He has a big mouth. I have seen my roads. I have travelled my roads. So, who is telling lie and who is telling the truth, you can easily differentiate and know. Lies do not have legs. They fall on the waste side."" The Congress has been in power in Mizoram since 2008 and is eyeing a third consecutive term. In the 2013 elections, the Congress had won 34 seats, while the MNF got five and the Mizoram People's Conference one. The ruling party had improved its tally in 2013 elections from 32 in 2008.

Press Trust of India," BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday attacked the state government's proposal to give 12 percent quota to Muslims, saying his party will never allow it as religion-based reservation is unconstitutional. Shah hit out at Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao over the issue during campaign rallies at Parkal and Nirmal ahead of the 7 December Assembly polls in the state. ""I want to tell Chandrasekhar Rao, the Supreme Court has fixed 50 percent ceiling (on total reservations). If you want to provide 12 percent reservation, from whose quota are you going to carve it out: from Dalits, tribals or OBCs? Decide this first,"" Shah said. Shah said Rao promised reservation to the minority community ""despite being aware"" of the 50 percent ceiling and forwarded the proposal (Bill) to the Centre. ""BJP would stand firmly to protect the reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes,"" he said. The Constitution does not allow reservation based on religion, the BJP chief said. He asked the gathering whether a religion-based reservation should be be given, and said, ""You don't worry.

The Bill is yet to get the Centre's nod. Meanwhile, speaking at a campaign rally at Shadnagar, Rao said the bill was not yet cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite repeated requests. ""We want to give reservations to Muslims. But Modi is against that. That is the reason I am advocating a non-Congress and non-BJP front government. You know that I fought for Telangana's statehood.

Press Trust of India," BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday accused the Congress of supporting ""Urban Naxals"" and said his party will put Maoists in jail if it is voted to power in Telangana. ""Urban Naxals"" is a term used to describe city-based supporters working in alleged front organisations of proscribed Maoist outfits. Addressing a public meeting in Nirmal district, Shah said, ""Recently they (Urban Naxals) were arrested in Maharashtra. The BJP government there, led by Devendra Fadnavis, put them behind bars, but Rahul Gandhi supported them."" ""Rahul baba, are you aware that hundreds of people in Telangana have died due to Naxalism?"" he asked. The BJP chief claimed Maoists were ""hiding"" in different parts of the state and said his party would look for them and send them to prison. ""They have only two options — either join the mainstream or get ready to face jail,"" Shah said. He also trained his guns at Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief and the state's caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, for demanding reservation for minorities. The BJP chief said Rao-led Telangana government had forwarded a   reservation for minorities despite knowing that it is not possible to do so. ""You don't worry. Even if KCR, the Congress, the TDP and Communists come together, I guarantee that till the BJP government is in the Centre, religion-based reservation will not be granted,"" Shah said. He accused Rao of failing to provide employment to the family members of those who sacrificed their lives during the Telangana statehood movement. Shah claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government had extended over 2.30 lakh crore for Telangana's development in the last four and half years, but the funds had not been utilised for the state's development. ""Over 2.30 lakh crore has been given by the central government to Telangana. Had it been any other state, problems would have been solved long back by utilising these funds. He (KCR) is not concerned about the children of Telangana, but only about his son and daughter,"" he alleged. The BJP chief told the gathering that he had brought a message from Modi which asked the people to bring the party to power in the 7 December Assembly polls so that Telangana can be developed as a model state.

Press Trust of India," Former TRS leader and Chevella MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy Sunday hinted at the possibility of a ""tacit understanding"" between the ruling party in Telangana and the BJP behind Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao's move to dissolve the Vidhan Sabha before completion of its full term. The dissolution of the Assembly in September this year had paved the way for early polls in the southern state. The elections to the 119-member Assembly are scheduled on 7 December. Reddy, who recently crossed over to the Congress, said the decision to hold early elections came as a ""shock"" to the people. Addressing reporters, he claimed that factors like the chief minister's ""tacit understanding with the Bhartiya Janata Party"" or ""falling popularity of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti"" might be behind the chief minister's move to dissolve the House. ""It was a matter of shock for all the people as to why the TRS government didn't complete the five years mandate given to them. Why would any government voluntarily dissolve the House and take the risk of being put under President's rule by the Central government?"" ""There was either a tacit understanding with the BJP or this step was taken out of fear due to the fast declining graph of the TRS in the state,"" he said. Reddy, who had won Chevella seat as a TRS candidate, joined the Congress on 23 November in the presence of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in a public meeting at Medchal. The chief minister had already dismissed reports that his move to dissolve the House was motivated politically. His daughter and Nizamabad MP MP K Kavitha has denied that her party had a ""covert"" understanding with the BJP. She has accused the Congress of spreading such rumours to get minority votes. Meanwhile, referring to his previous stint in the TRS, Reddy said some of his initiatives were appreciated by the national and international bodies such as Unicef, but were not recognised by the KCR- led party. ""I was constantly insulted by various means including removal of my flex boards in the constituency (Chevella),"" he said. Reddy said the state government is yet to formally apply to the Centre seeking a national status for the Kaleshwaram project though it has been raising the demand. The chief minister had laid the foundation stone for the Kaleshwaram irrigation project, taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 80,500 crore, on May 2, 2016. The project aims to take water to the state's drought-hit regions. Reddy further said the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, which ensures that no state government goes about spending its budget indiscriminately, has been completely neglected by the state. ""The state government debt is to the tune of Rs 2.20 lakh crore. It works out at around Rs 61,000 per person if apportioned to individual citizens in the state,"" he said. Responding to a query, Reddy said the TRS took an ambiguous stand on the Triple Talaq Bill that was passed by Parliament recently. The Congress had last month forged 'Prajakutami' (People's Alliance) with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of Chandrababu Naidu, the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) to take on the TRS in upcoming polls.",2018-11-25,"BJP,K Chandrashekar Rao,KCR,Konda Vishweshwar Reddy,NewsTracker,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,TRS","KCR may have dissolved Telangana Vidhan Sabha due to 'tacit understanding' with BJP, claims ex-TRS leader",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/kcr-may-have-dissolved-telangana-vidhan-sabha-due-to-tacit-understanding-with-bjp-claims-ex-trs-leader-5614461.html,firstpost,-1,0
Asian News International,": The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said that the Congress' remark on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mother showed nothing but the party's ""feudalistic mindset."" Addressing a press conference in Bhopal, BJP vice-president Prabhat Jha said the Congress was so perturbed by the persona of the prime minister that they had to resort to attacking his mother. ""The prime minister represents 130 crore Indians. How can the Congress attack his mother like that? Not only that, the way they attacked his mother is condemnable. They should not forget the fact that Modi Ji's mother is 96 years old,"" he said. Jha further added, ""Is Narendra Modi not the prime minister of the Opposition too?

Press Trust of India," Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the Congress on Sunday for dragging his parents into a political slugfest, alleging that it was being done at the behest of party chief Rahul Gandhi.

""Had my parents held any public post, they should also have been criticised."" ""Your family has occupied top positions at the national level. The more you ask me about my performance, the onus is more on your family as well,"" he added. The Opposition party was left with no issues and was, therefore, indulging in this kind of an abusive rhetoric, Modi said. ""The Congress should compare its 55 years of rule with my four years (at the Centre) and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's 15 years (in the state). ""The Congress is lying so much to people that the people of Madhya Pradesh should wake up and ensure that not a single Congress candidate wins,"" he added.

Press Trust of India," A one-day special session of the Delhi Assembly on Monday is likely to be stormy as AAP legislators will discuss the recent attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, while the Opposition BJP MLAs will seek to corner the ruling party over issues concerning people. On 20 November, a man threw chilli powder at Kejriwal outside his office in the Delhi Secretariat. On 22 November, the Delhi Cabinet decided to convene a one-day Assembly session on Monday to discuss the attack on the chief minister and the alleged ""mass deletion"" of names in voters list in the city.

Ajaz Ashraf,"Madhya Pradesh has emerged as the most coveted prize to bag among the three north Indian states due to elect their new Assemblies this year. This is because Madhya Pradesh mirrors the big Indian story of agrarian distress, economic disruptions caused by demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax, and social conflict. Should the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) still win the state for the fourth time in a row, the Congress will seem a ship doomed to sink in the whirlpool of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Conversely, a Congress victory will have the party set sail its flotilla for capturing power in Delhi. Among the three north Indian states, Chhattisgarh’s national significance is limited as it sends only 11 MPs to the Lok Sabha. By contrast, Madhya Pradesh has 29 Lok Sabha seats, just three more than Rajasthan’s 26. Yet Rajasthan has been relegated in importance because a Congress triumph here will be par for the course. Ever since the BJP formed the government in Rajasthan in 1993, the power there has alternated between it and the Congress every five years. A Congress victory, therefore, cannot be taken as a reflection of the political mood in north India. By contrast, the BJP won 165 out 230 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh in 2013, 143 in 2008, and 173 in 2003. More significantly, it polled 44.87 percent of votes in 2013, 37.64 percent in 2008, and 42.50 percent in 2003. In fact, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP’s vote share ballooned to a stunning 54.03 percent, a rarity in India. ""In the aftermath of the fall of the Congress nationally, there are not many states where the dominance of one single party has been shaping so clearly. In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is not only kept out of power, but the BJP has also established its domination beyond electoral politics,"" wrote Yatindra Singh Sisodia in  , a paper he authored in 2014. Based on the post-poll survey he conducted for the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi, Sisodia, quite significantly, added, “It (BJP) has also been able to spread its support base across social sections… While the leadership (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan) factor that contributed to the electoral success may have limitations in the long run, the fact that the BJP has wider social base and that it is seen as a party that may perform better than its rivals, will surely remain more dependable factors in this consolidation.” Not only has the Congress been kept out of power in Madhya Pradesh for 15 years, it lags far behind the BJP. For instance, it polled 36.38 percent of votes in the 2013 Assembly elections, nearly nine percent less than the BJP. Yet the hopes of the Congress have risen because of the social and economic tumult in the state, making it believe that the moment is propitious to overcome the massive lead the BJP has over it. Only a Congress win or photo finish in Madhya Pradesh will provide proof whether anti-incumbency, of even indeterminate magnitude, has set in against Modi and the BJP. Yet the task of beating the BJP in Madhya Pradesh is formidable. For instance, agrarian distress in the state has been grabbing headlines, mostly notably when five farmers died in police firing last year. Traditionally, the BJP is considered an urban-centric party. Yet, in 2013, out of 194 constituencies in the state where urban population is less than 50 percent, the BJP won as many as 132, against the 55 that the Congress won. These comparative figures show the BJP has roots deep enough in rural Madhya Pradesh to limit the outfall of the discontent among farmers. The challenge before the Congress to eat into the BJP’s rural base can also be perceived from the perspective of caste. The largest segment of agriculturists in the state belongs to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), which account for around 42 percent of the electorate. Chouhan is a Dhakad, an OBC community engaged in agriculture and constituting about 3 to 4 percent of the state’s electorate. The BJP’s OBC base is formidable – 67 percent of Yadavs voted for it in 2013 as against 25 percent of them for the Congress. The chasm between the two parties was less when it came to the support of non-Yadav OBCs – 45 percent of them voted for the BJP and 35 percent for the Congress. Given that the Dhakads are not numerically preponderant, it can be argued that Chouhan’s OBC identity will not stem the BJP’s slide because of agrarian distress. However, Chouhan has refrained from harping on his OBC identity, choosing instead to project himself as the “son of a farmer.” He has repeatedly projected the Congress as the party of “raja (Digvijay Singh), maharaja (Jyotiradita Scindia) and udyogpati (industrialist).” In this context, it will be interesting to see whether agrarian distress will drive farmers to desert one of their own fighting to save his chief ministerial chair. Should the BJP’s support among OBC farmers crack in a state that is its stronghold, it will be to the benefit of Opposition parties anchored among middle castes. In north India, the gains will not accrue to the Congress, whose upper caste leadership structure has always shied away from courting the OBCs on the basis of their caste identity. As such, in Madhya Pradesh, both the upper castes and OBCs have been railing against the BJP for reversing the Supreme Court judgment that was seen to have diluted the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In 2013, the BJP won 28 out of 35 seats reserved for SCs and 31 out of 47 seats reserved for STs. The anger among the upper castes and OBCs could, quite surprisingly, adversely impact the BJP in the SC reserved seats. This is because in 30 out of 35 such seats, the OBCs and the upper castes together account for as much as 60-65 percent of votes. Should they decide to not support the BJP, its 2013 tally of 28 seats would likely dip. Comprising less than 16 percent of the electorate, the upper castes have been die-hard supporters of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh – 57 percent of Brahmins, 60 percent of Rajputs and 43 percent of other upper castes voted for the BJP in 2013. In comparison, only 22 percent of Brahmins, 25 percent of Rajputs and 25 percent of other upper castes did for the Congress. Is the disaffection of the upper castes against the BJP strong enough to propel them in decisive numbers to the Congress? The answer to this question will determine whether the Congress will continue to play the soft Hindu card, such as indulging in its own brand of politics over the cow and projecting its leader Rahul Gandhi as the janeu-dhari Brahmin. Madhya Pradesh could very well have the Congress redefining its self – and becoming a pole to which the upper castes, particularly Brahmins, could decide to flock. In hindsight, one reason why the Congress did not stitch an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was perhaps because it feared such a decision would alienate the upper castes and OBCs-farmers. In 2013, 36 percent of SCs voted for the BJP in 2013, 33 percent for the Congress and 22 percent for the BSP. What the Congress could have gained from aligning with the BSP, it hopes to more than make up with the votes of the upper castes and farmers. Yet it might become a problem for the Congress if the BSP’s vote-share among Dalits increases exponentially and the upper castes and OBCs don’t desert the BJP in significant numbers. In 2013, out of 57 constituencies having SC population of 20 percent and above, the Congress won just eight seats and the BJP a whopping 46. Then again, out of 80 seats in which STs constituted 20 percent or more of the population, the BJP won 49 seats and the Congress 29. Much has been written on Madhya Pradesh’s economic woes arising from demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax. In 2013, the BJP polled 42 percent of votes of the upper income group, 46 percent of the middle income group, 45 percent of the lower income group, and 44 percent of the poor. By contrast, the Congress polled 27 of votes of the upper income group, 34 percent of the middle income group, 38 percent of the lower income group, and 44 percent of the poor. In other words, the BJP was voted by as many poor as was the Congress, traditionally the principal recipient of their votes. Let alone the poor, in case the BJP loses substantial ground among the middle and lower income groups, the Congress would cite this as proof of the backlash against the Modi government’s economic policies. It could arm the Congress to mount an attack on the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Creating credible narratives in electoral politics is undoubtedly important. But Madhya Pradesh’s significance goes far beyond that – it will tell us whether the BJP has the skills to resolve the animosities its own social policies have triggered among its large support base; and whether it can pacify those who have been cut by its economic policies. On the other hand, the fall of the BJP’s impregnable fortress of Madhya Pradesh will recast Congress’ personality into a mould that will have an upper caste polish to it, apart from encouraging its leaders into believing that anti-incumbency has started to work against the BJP and that they have hit upon the right strategy to take advantage of it.",2018-11-26,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Caste Politics,Congress,Farmers In India,Farmers In Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Polls,MP Assembly Election,PoliticalPlay,SC/ST Act,Shivraj Singh Chouhan","Madhya Pradesh Assembly election results will tell us more about 2019 than all other four states, here's why",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-assembly-poll-has-bearing-on-2019-will-test-bjps-skills-in-curbing-damage-caused-by-its-social-policies-5615941.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat Sunday said the time for patience was over and a law should be brought to facilitate the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh if the matter was not a priority for the apex court. Speaking at a rally organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on the Ram temple issue in Nagpur, Bhagwat also said this should be the ""decisive phase of the agitation"". ""One year ago, I myself had said be patient. Now I say, patience will not work. Now we need to mobilise people. Now we should demand a law,"" he said. ""If, for whatever reasons, because the court has a busy schedule or maybe it does not understand the sensibilities of the society, the Ram temple case is not a priority for them, then the government should think how to bring a law for the construction of the temple....the law should be introduced at the earliest,"" Bhagwat added. ""Now this should be the decisive phase of this agitation,"" he said. The RSS chief said in 1992, those agitating for the temple at Ayodhya had approached then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, but he did not take a prompt decision. ""(Then) the karsevaks (volunteers) got angry and what happened, happened,"" he said, referring to the demolition of the Babri mosque on 6 December, 1992. Asserting that the Ram Janmabhoomi was a matter of faith which could not be questioned, Bhagwat said, ""The society does not move only by the words of law, but also by its own wishes."" ""In 2010, the court (Allahabad High Court) had ruled in favour of the construction of the Ram temple, but now, indications are clear that it is not a priority of the (apex) court,"" he added. The Supreme Court, hearing appeals against the high court's decision, had said earlier in November that it would hear the matter only in January, 2019. Bhagwat also said people should not fight with the government, but build pressure on it. ""The government, if not willing to build the temple, would bow down before such pressure, or if it wanted to build it but could not find a way, would gain ""strength from the public pressure"", he added.",2018-11-25,"Ayodhya,Babri Mosque,Mohan Bhagwat,NewsTracker,Ram Janmabhoomi,Ram Temple Agitation,Ram Temple Dispute,Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,RSS,Uttar Pradesh,Vishwa Hindu Parishad","Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid dispute: Mohan Bhagwat says time for patience over, calls for law for temple construction",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ram-mandir-babri-masjid-dispute-mohan-bhagwat-says-time-for-patience-over-calls-for-law-for-temple-construction-5615191.html,firstpost,-1,0
Asian News International,": Hitting out at the Congress party over the article published in the National Herald, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said that that the Congress party was spreading lies as it was scared of defeat in the ensuing Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls.

Suhit K Sen,"On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fired a dud while on the campaign trail in Rajasthan. In Alwar, Modi said the Congress was trying to politicise the judiciary by pressuring it to postpone hearing the Ayodhya case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This is being read as a thinly-veiled reference to the party’s 'attempt' to move an impeachment procedure against former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. So let us examine, to begin with, some of the cases heard by benches headed by Misra in the last week of September, just before he retired. In five of the major cases heard by the Supreme Court, three went in favour of the government: In the Bhima-Koregaon arrests case, the bench refused to entertain a plea by a number of eminent people for the dismissal of the cases against five activists; in the Ayodhya case, the bench forebore from reviewing a judgment passed by an earlier Supreme Court bench, which had held that a mosque was not integral to practicing Islam; similarly, a bench did not review an earlier judgment on reservations in promotions in government jobs for Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The Aadhaar judgment was a mixed bag: On the one hand, the bench ruled the scheme constitutional, while it disallowed the linking of the Aadhaar number with bank accounts and phone numbers. On balance, if anything, the government won. Liberal judgments were passed in two cases: The Supreme Court struck down legal provisions making adultery a criminal offence for men but not for women; and, it allowed women between the ages of 10 and 50 — those capable of menstruating — to enter the inner sanctum of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala. This list is not meant to impugn the Supreme Court or the benches that passed these judgments. But, with all respect, it does not paint a picture of a CJI quaking with fear at the Congress' threat of impeachment. It is entirely possible that he understood, unlike Modi, that the gesture was symbolic and the Congress, or Opposition, did not have the numbers in Parliament to impeach him. To impeach any Supreme Court judge, each House of Parliament must pass an impeachment resolution supported by a simple majority of the total strength of the relevant House and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting. Let's look, on the other hand, at how Modi's party reacted to recent Supreme Court orders and decisions. After Justice Ranjan Gogoi took over as the CJI, he made it clear that he would not pass an order on the Ayodhya case in haste. He has scheduled a hearing for early January. Fearing that a final judgment may not be passed before the 2019 Lok Sabha, the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and other Sangh parivar affiliates have gone into a steroid-fuelled campaign mode, evident in the massive show of strength in Ayodhya over the weekend. The univocal and infructuous demand is that the Central government must pass an ordinance or a law to enable the building of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, thus  . The Sabarimala verdict has been seen by many, especially Hindutva hardliners as an attack on tradition and, indeed, Hinduism itself. The BJP, RSS, the temple authorities and others have thus created a huge Kerala-wide shindig to obstruct the implementation of the Supreme Court order. Up until now, no woman between the ages of 10 and 50 has been allowed to exercise her right to worship, which has been judicially underwritten, by main force. It's not just the judiciary that the BJP and the governments it runs have grievously undermined. They have serially undermined or subverted any number of institutions. Take the Election Commission. It announced the dates for the Himachal Pradesh elections in October last year — for November — but delayed announcing the dates for the Gujarat elections, which were finally held in December. This allowed the BJP-run Gujarat government a month's respite to announce schemes and the party to get its campaign organised better. The elections turned out to be a closely-run affair despite this delay, with the BJP winning 99 out of 182 seats, only seven seats more than needed for a majority. The delay, thus, proved crucial. More recently, the Election Commission delayed the announcement of dates for Assembly elections in five states — Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana — by around three hours. By that time, Modi had addressed a rally in Rajasthan and the state's chief minister announced a scheme for free power supply just before the dates were announced and the Model Code of Conduct came into force. Whether this was pure coincidence or whether, as the Election Commission claimed, official procedures caused the delay is left to readers to judge. The BJP government at the Centre has also subverted various executive arms of the government — the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate   — to use them as a tool to harass political opponents. This can hardly be said to be a particularly new phenomenon; other governments have done the same thing before. But the particularly brazen and consistent way in which the Modi regime has gone about its work has imperilled democracy itself. Throw into the mix this government's attempts to intimidate the media and you have a complete picture of a government that pays only token respect to constitutional norms. Thus, for Modi to say that the Congress is guilty of any form of subversion only shows how dangerously confident the prime minister is about his patent falsehoods and autocratic ways being overlooked by the electorate and citizenry. It is to be hoped that the results of the ongoing Assembly elections will bring him and his party down several notches.",2018-11-26,"Amit Shah,Ayodhya Verdict,BJP,Chief Justice Of India,Congress,Dipak Misra,InMyOpinion,Judiciary,Narendra Modi,Ram Mandir,Ranjan Gogoi,Sabarimala Verdict","Modi charging Congress with bullying SC judge to defer Ayodhya ruling is risible, BJP more guilty of such conduct",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/modi-charging-congress-with-bullying-sc-judge-to-defer-ayodhya-ruling-is-risible-his-party-is-more-guilty-of-such-conduct-5618001.html,firstpost,-1,0

She added that the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are well aware of the fact that they are losing elections in States and Centre which is why they are resorting to Mandir issue through 'proxies and allies like Shiv Sena, RSS and VHP' as a strategy. ""Out of the promises that the Bharatiya Janata Party, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made to the people of this country during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, I personally feel not even 50 percent of that have been fulfilled. In fact, 50 percent is also too much to say. Both BJP and Prime Minister Modi are fully well aware of this. They are also aware of the fact that they will not come back to power in the five states, where elections are currently being held. They are forcefully making Ram Temple a burning issue. If their mindset was correct, then they could have done it a few years back also. This their political plan,"" Mayawati said. Mayawati's statement comes ahead of   over the weekend. While the VHP is terming its gathering as Dharm Sansad, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is going to participate in an aarti at the Saryu River, offer prayers at Ram Janambhoomi. Thackeray is also carrying soil from Shiveri Fort in Pune, the birthplace of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, that he will hand over to the priest of Ram Janambhoomi. ""In context with the Assembly elections in five states, I have done rallies in two states — Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh — to support my party candidates. After conducting rallies in both these states I have learnt that Bharatiya Janata Party does not stand any chance to come back to power in both these states,"" Mayawati told   on Saturday. ""This party (BJP) will also not come back in power in Centre too due to its failures. The BJP, RSS and their alliances, especially Shiv Sena, are very well aware of this fact. This is the reason why this party as part of its well-designed conspiracy is trying to hide its failures by claiming that Ram Temple will be constructed in Ayodhya by putting in front saints, RSS and Shiv Sena,"" she added. Mayawati is of the view that the BJP should solve the Ayodhya land dispute only through the legal route and the Supreme Court. A mass gathering has been organised in Ayodhya to build pressure on the Central Government for the construction of Ram Temple at the site of the razed Babri mosque. The mega show will coincide with a two-day visit of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to Ayodhya. This comes after the Supreme Court on 29 October adjourned the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit till January 2019 to fix the next hearing date in the matter, challenging the Allahabad High Court ruling of 2010. The Allahabad High Court in its 2010 verdict had suggested a division of the disputed land in Ayodhya — one for each of the parties the Nirmohi Akhara, the Sunni Waqf Board and Ram Lalla. Babri Masjid, known to have been constructed by Mughal emperor Babur in Ayodhya in 1528, was allegedly demolished by right wing groups on December 6, 1992, who claimed that the mosque was built after demolishing the Ram Temple to the ground.",2018-11-24,"Allahabad High Court,Ayodhya Dispute,BJP,BSP,Mayawati,NewsTracker,Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid Issue,Ram Mandir Dispute,Ram Temple Dispute,RSS,Shiv Sena,Supreme Court Of India,Uddhav Thackeray,VHP","BJP orchestrating Ram Mandir movement through Shiv Sena, VHP to divert attention from governance failures, says Mayawati",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-orchestrating-ram-mandir-movement-through-shiv-sena-vhp-to-divert-attention-from-governance-failures-says-mayawati-5609291.html,firstpost,-1,0
Srinivasa Prasad,"In William Shakespeare's  the ill-tempered king Leontes of Sicily orders his daughter Perdita to be abandoned in a faraway place when she is born. A shepherd brings her up, and the king sees her in dramatic circumstances when she is a grown-up. European audiences who watched this play were elated by this reunion of father and daughter. Some apparently sobbed with joy and fainted. The “Telangana thalli”— or the “mother of Telangana”, as Congress leaders described Sonia Gandhi — claimed her child at an election rally near Hyderabad on Friday night. But the audience didn’t faint with joy. They might even start asking questions. The most important question is: Why didn’t Sonia come to see the “child” even once during the four-and-a-half years after Telangana was born? But the claptrap of election rallies is not meant to be dissected like an animal in the laboratory. So Congress and Sonia did their emotional best — or worst as some might see it — to sell the mother-child yarn to voters. Congress leaders competed with one another to say why Telangana could never have been born without her. The reference, of course, was to the fact that the state was formed in 2014 by the UPA-II government. For her part, Sonia spoke of Telangana being a new baby that has been neglected. The UPA chairperson said: “All mothers know what it’s like denying nutrition and good upbringing to children. Every mother wishes her children to grow up well. I feel sadness when I see Telangana.” Watched by the leaders of Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Telangana Jana Samithi and CPI, which are part of the Mahakutami alliance along with Congress, party chief Rahul Gandhi continued the theme, saying: “Sonia stood by your side when you fought for Telangana.” If the ‘mother’ hadn’t come calling to Telangana for close to five years, it was, in fact, because Congress had abandoned the ‘child’. It was a case of goofing up in haste and repenting in leisure. In an unseemly hurry, Congress divided Andhra Pradesh in 2014, carving Telangana out of it. With the juggernaut of Narendra Modi marching through India and sensing a rout in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the party broke the state with the hope of winning both parts of it. Congress dreamed that the people of Telangana, once they got a separate state, would be grateful enough to stand by the party. They didn’t. It hoped that the promise of special status would prompt what remained of Andhra Pradesh to toe its line. It didn’t. With TDP and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) winning Andhra Pradesh and Telangana respectively in 2014 and seemingly ensconced in the two states, Congress lost hope of getting them back anytime soon. Like a hound on the scent of a fox, Congress is now smelling power in Telangana. This had been evident for some time now, but it was doubly confirmed at the Friday night rally. Apart from the mother-son tale that Congress was peddling to reclaim power in Telangana, two other things couldn’t be missed at the rally at Medchal, 30 kilometres north of Hyderabad. One was that DK Shivakumar, Karnataka’s ace trouble-shooter, was prominent on the dais. Just in case you are wondering what the Congress leader from a neighbouring state was doing there, you must remember that Shivakumar is Karnataka’s richest politician. Officially, we were informed that Shivakumar’s services had been commissioned to “talk to” rebel Congress candidates in Telangana. The number of rebels Congress has in the field is always in direction proportion to the chances of the party’s victory. Congress had as many as 20 rebels in Telangana in this election. There were other senior leaders as well to persuade rebels to withdraw from contest, but Shivakumar’s presence was most overpowering. Possession of wealth and skills of persuasion go famously hand in hand. With a victory in Telangana a distinct possibility — as Congress sees it — the party didn’t take a chance and did everything it could to ensure that the rebels didn’t make this election a slip between the cup and the lip. The second thing that confirmed how seriously Congress is viewing the Telangana Assembly election is the fact that Sonia chose to campaign there despite poor health. She hasn’t addressed a single rally, so far, in any of the other four states going to polls: Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram. The party apparently thought her presence was essential for playing the Telangana-thalli card, which, in turn, was key to winning the state. Though evident even earlier, the party’s campaign theme from now till the 7 December polling will be crystallised on the lines of Sonia’s speech. By projecting her as the fairy godmother who created the new state, Congress will pander to Telangana sub-nationalism, which was what TRS leader and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR, as he is better known) did in 2014. Thus claiming credit for Telangana’s creation, Congress will also promise all the good things that KCR assured people but hasn’t delivered. At the same time, Sonia walked the political tightrope at the rally — and the party leaders will continue to do that during the campaign — by promising “special status” to Andhra Pradesh. This was a condition on which TDP leader and Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu agreed to be an ally of Congress. This is aimed at pleasing the 60 lakh people of Andhra Pradesh origin in Telangana as well as the voters in Andhra Pradesh in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. At the root of Congress’ optimism is the fact that though Rao won Telangana in 2014, Congress didn’t do too badly. While TRS won with a   and 63 seats of 119, Congress polled 25 percent votes and 21 seats. What makes Congress a formidable opponent this time around is that TDP, its ally now, had a vote share of 14.5 percent and 15 seats. What also makes Congress hope for a win is the possible negative vote against KCR. The problem with the KCR government is not that it hasn’t done any good work. It’s simply that the chief minister made the mistake of promising too much. During the long agitation for a separate state, the people of Telangana had been told ad nauseam that the sole reason for almost all their problems was that they remained part of Andhra Pradesh, which allegedly stole their resources and jobs. But even four-and-a-half years after Telangana became a separate state, they find little perceptible improvement in their lives, despite the flurry of populist schemes that target almost every section of the society. The TRS leader may have lost the battle of perception about the work he has done, but two weeks before polling day, it’s yet too early to rule out his victory. The one thing that KCR can take comfort from is the fact that despite hyping up its campaign, Congress hasn’t projected a chief ministerial candidate, and the available choice for the top job in that party doesn’t exactly fill people with too much enthusiasm. Whether the story of Congress in Telangana will end on a happy note like Shakespeare’s tale of King Leontes will be known on 11 December, the day of counting of votes. In the middle of all this hoo-ha about motherhood and statehood, one question begs to be answered: Where does BJP figure in Telangana? Answer: Like the “clown” in the Leontes story, BJP stays on the sidelines with little support in the state.",2018-11-24,"Andhra Pradesh,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,ConnectTheDots,InMyOpinion,K Chandrashekar Rao,Mahagathbandhan,Mahakutami,TDP,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,TRS","Sensing chink in KCR armour, Congress pushes narrative of Sonia Gandhi as 'mother of Telangana'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sensing-chink-in-kcr-armour-congress-pushes-narrative-of-sonia-gandhi-as-mother-of-telangana-5610661.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Acting upon the Bharatiya Janata Party's complaint, the Election Commission sent  a notice to senior Congress leader CP Joshi for his casteist remarks during a poll meeting in Rajasthan. Joshi is required to submit a reply by 25 November. Joshi had reportedly said Thursday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP MP Uma Bharti and Hindu activist Sadhvi Ritambhara are from ""lower castes"" and know nothing of Hinduism. He had also said it is the Brahmins who are learned and know of Hinduism. Though Joshi on Friday apologised for his comments, the BJP  , saying the remarks ""insulted"" Indian culture and the Hindu religion, and dared Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to expel him from the party. ""The comments made by the Congress leader (Joshi) based on caste, section and religion in an election rally are violation of the model code of conduct. So, a complaint has been lodged with the Election Commission,"" BJP Rajasthan election cell convenor, Nahar Singh Maheshwari, said in a statement. Polls in Rajasthan are scheduled on 7 December. ""There is fear of social unrest and hatred in society due to Joshi's comments, so the Election Commission should take strong action (against him) for making such a statement,"" he said. Joshi apologised after Gandhi disapproved his comments and asked him to express regret. The Congress chief also asked other party leaders to refrain from making such statements which hurt any segment of society. In a tweet in Hindi, Joshi said, ""Respecting the principles of the Congress party and the sentiments of party workers, I feel sorry if my statement has hurt the feelings of any section of society."" Thursday night, he had posted his speech on Twitter and Facebook, saying, ""I strongly condemn the fabricated use of my statement by BJP. To put all the speculation to rest, here is enclosed the clipping of the speech.""  the Congress leader's comments in a tweet, saying Joshi's remarks do not reflect, and are contrary, to the ideals of the Congress party, and urged party leaders to refrain from making such statements. ""While respecting the Congress party's principles and the sentiments of party workers, I am sure Joshiji will realise his mistake. He should express regret over his remarks,"" the Congress chief said on Twitter. Stressing that Joshi had ""insulted the Indian culture as well as the Hindu religion"", Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of ""dividing every religion for power"". ""The statement of Congress leader (Joshi) is baseless, wrong and condemnable. It reflects that the Congress doesn't know the history of Indian culture and Hindu religion,"" Trivedi said at a press conference in Jaipur. BJP leader and spokesperson Sambit Patra said, ""What CP Joshi has done is target the prime minister based on his caste. It is not acceptable. If Rahul has the guts, then remove CP Joshi now....

Ram Gopal Jat," The Congress has set tongues wagging in  . As if the much-touted tug-of-war between “old horse” Ashok Gehlot and “young turk” Sachin Pilot wasn’t enough, the party’s state unit is now facing a problem of plenty when it comes to chief ministerial aspirants. If recent statements of Congress leaders are anything to go by, seasoned former chief minister Gehlot and Rajasthan Congress chief Pilot have both set their hearts on the chief minister’s chair. Also in the ring is leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, Rameshwar Dudi. While Gehlot is popular with the public and party members, Pilot is seen as a youthful, dynamic leader and Dudi has considerable support among the Jats. But the party strategists have refused to set the record straight and declare the chief ministerial face at the outset — a move that many believe may just cost the Congress dear in the elections that are weeks away. As of now, the Congress is favoured to win Rajasthan, where the BJP's Vasundhara Raje is facing anti-incumbency. The BJP, on the other hand, was quick to declare the unrelenting Raje as its chief ministerial face as many as five months ahead of the 7 December election. Two-term chief minister  , while speaking to the media and addressing poll rallies, has maintained that there is no need to project anyone as the chief ministerial face, as the Congress central leadership would decide on it once the election results are declared. Pilot, too, has been quoted as saying that after the results are out, the party’s central leadership would decide who to place at the helm of government. Dudi, on his part, has insisted that only an elected MLA would head the government if the Congress emerges victorious and that the chief minister would be decided by none other than party president Rahul Gandhi. Congress insiders have hinted at Dudi’s chief ministerial aspirations, but he brushed aside the issue by simply saying that it would be premature to reveal any such desire. While Dudi has not engaged in open hostilities, Gehlot and Pilot — both of whom declared a few days ago that they would contest the Assembly polls — have been shooting darts at each other. Gehlot has frequently announced that where the Rajasthan Congress leadership was concerned, he is the only state unit chief who rose to become chief minister in 1998. This June, while addressing the media in Sikar, he took a jibe at Pilot by saying that whenever a new state Congress chief is appointed in Rajasthan, a group of 5-7 reporters form a coterie to project him as “chief minister material” and spin “feel good factor” reports. In his remarks, Gehlot further indirectly advised Pilot, a two-term MP and former Union minister, to stay away from such “feel good” media people. Pilot sought to even the score by announcing that within a week of taking charge as Rajasthan party chief, he had identified “sycophants from the media” and assured Gehlot that he wasn’t playing into the hands of any such journalist. The former chief minister’s clearest statement to Pilot was, however, at a state-level Congress meet in Jaipur this August, when he suggested that the younger leader should abandon his dream of becoming the chief minister. ""The Congress has not declared the chief ministerial candidate yet. But if we talk about who is more influential, the one who has been the chief minister twice and has been in the dominating position for ten years, who can be more influential than that?” Gehlot reportedly told Pilot. At another press conference following that, he questioned the need for the Congress to look for another chief ministerial candidate, since he had held the post on two occasions. Pilot exhibited political maturity by not responding to his words. While the tension between Gehlot and Pilot simmered, BJP chief Amit Shah announced at a party meeting in July that the poll campaign in Rajasthan would be led by Raje, who would also remain chief minister if the party won. Speaking to this reporter, BJP’s state unit chief Madan Lal Saini wondered why the electorate would vote for the Congress when there is uncertainty over who is leading the party’s campaign and who the chief ministerial candidate is. Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, convener of BJP’s poll management committee, insisted that the state Congress was a divided house, and that this was evident from the party’s indecisiveness on the chief ministerial candidate. He claimed there were not three but at least four Congress leaders angling for the chair. “The state has witnessed unprecedented development under the leadership of Raje. That’s why the party is projecting her as its face again,” he said, asking: “What good can the Congress do for the people when it can’t even decide who its leader is in the state?"" Satish Punia, BJP’s state spokesperson and co-convener of the election management committee, alleged that the Congress was suffering from a leadership crisis. State Congress chief Pilot has tried to dispel the rumours which have gained currency. “Our party is in the electoral battle as one composite unit. Once our party secures majority, Rahul Gandhi will take a call on who would be chief minister. The person would be decided through consensus by the central high command,” he said recently. Insisting that he wasn’t in the race for the top post, Pilot did point out that in the past few years he had rebuilt and strengthened the Congress in Rajasthan, and victory in the previous three by-elections was proof of his work. As Pilot attempted to settle the matter diplomatically, Gehlot fired another salvo last week — by mentioning several names which, according to him, were in the fray for chief ministership. At a public contact campaign, he pointed out that besides him there were five other contenders in the Congress, such as Pilot, Dudi, CP Joshi, Girija Vyas and BD Kalla. Observers have taken his announcement with a pinch of salt.

Rangoli Agarwal and Ram Gopal Jat," Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia’s decision to contest for a fourth consecutive time from Jhalrapatan constituency immediately led to speculation that she was grooming her son Dushyant Singh to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha  polls. BJP rebels were quick to hit out at Raje over her decision to continue with Jhalrapatan. Ghanshyam Tiwari, who quit the BJP to form his own outfit, dubs Raje an ""outsider, who is bent upon promoting her son's political career"". Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal, also a former BJP man who formed the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) and is causing serious problems for both BJP and Congress, said that an insecure Raje would never dare change her constituency. Congress leader Sachin Pilot also chipped in saying, “The chief minister would get the real taste of electoral politics if she takes up the challenge of shifting to some other constituency."" The contestants in Jhalrapatan are an interesting lot. Raje's main opponent is former BJP leader Jaswant’s Singh’s son Manvendra Singh who was a surprise Congress choice. Mukul Chaudhary was angling for Congress ticket, but the party refused. Earlier, it was speculated that she may contest the election as an Independent candidate. However, she did not file nomination till the last day. Incidentally, Jhalrapatan is part of Jhalawar Lok Sabha seat, which is probably why Raje refused to budge despite the BJP leadership wanting her to change her constituency. Dushyant, a two-time MP from Jhalawar, could not get a ministerial berth in the Narendra Modi cabinet which has not gone down well with the Scindia camp. Especially since three other Rajasthan MPs — PP Chaudhary from Pali, Arjun Ram Meghwal from Bikaner and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat from Jodhpur — became ministers. Raje scotched all speculation of alternate constituencies like Lalsot and Dholpur and a double contest from Lalsot and Jhalrapatan, by quickly filing her nomination papers for the latter. Raje had refused Lalsot despite the fact that voters in the Assembly constituency, which was earlier held by BJP turncoat Kishori Lal Meena, had appealed to Raje to contest from there. Raje also sprang a surprise by nominating Kirori Lal Meena’s wife and former MLA Golma Devi Meena from Lalsot. Subsequently, the BJP claimed that there was never any speculation about Raje's constituency. ""Some party workers were demanding that Raje contest from Lalsot or nearby constituencies,"" said BJP state president Madanlal Saini. But this demand was rejected during the first meeting itself, he informs. ""Raje couldn’t fight from Lalsot because it is a reserved seat,"" added political analyst Sanjay Bohra. “She was expected to fight from Dholpur. However, it was speculated that if she leaves Jhalrapatan, it will appear that she has lost control over Jhalawar. Moreover, the BJP high command had made it clear that no one will be allowed to change seats."" This is despite the fact that Raje contesting from Lalsot would have been a boost for the party in eastern Rajasthan. Besides Jhalrapatan, Jhalawar district consists of Khanpur and two reserved Assembly constituencies — Manohar Thana and Dag. Long associated with the Gwalior family, the district has a large Rajput population even in the reserved constituencies, with Jats having little or no presence. Since Dushyant has never been considered close to his Jat father Hemant Singh — he is seen more a Rajput than a Jat — the BJP sees him as the favourite to win Jhalawar seat in the 2019 polls. The chances of his win increases if Raje retains the Jhalrapatan Assembly constituency. Probably that is why Saini is also determined to have Dushyant contest from Jhalawar. ""There is no chance of changing Dushyant,” the BJP state president recently said. Interestingly, Raje and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot, are the only two politicians in Rajasthan who have never changed their constituency. Though Raje’s electoral record beats Gehlot’s performance hollow —  she won three consecutive Assembly elections in 2003, 2008 and 2013, besides being a Lok Sabha MP for five terms from 1989 to 2003 — Rajasthan has a record of defeating incumbent chief ministers. Ashok Gehlot replaced Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, then Gehlot was toppled by Raje, who then lost to Gehlot till she evened the score in 2013.",2018-11-25,"BJP,Dushyant Singh,Jhalrapatan,Jhalwar,Lalsot,Lok Sabha Elections 2019,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election,Rajasthan Assembly Polls,Rajasthan Polls,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan polls: Vasundhara Raje clings to Jhalrapatan seat to hold onto Jhalawar, improve son Dushyant's chances in 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-vasundhara-raje-refused-to-leave-jhalrapatan-seat-to-maintain-hold-on-jhalawar-improve-son-dushyants-chances-in-2019-5612191.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said Saturday Prime Minister Narendra Modi has betrayed the people, claiming that he had not fulfilled promises of providing two crore jobs every year and ""depositing"" Rs 15 lakh in their bank accounts. Rahul addressed election rallies at Sagar, Damoh and Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region of poll-bound Madhya Pradesh on Saturday. The state goes to polls on 28 November and results will be declared on 11 December. ""Modi   has betrayed the people on the issue of providing jobs to two crore people every year and depositing Rs 15 lakh cash into their accounts by bringing (back) black money stashed abroad,"" Rahul said in Sagar. Modi, during the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, had prominently highlighted the issue of black money and had promised to bring it back. The fear of losing the 2019 general elections has created ""hatred"" in Prime Minister Modi's mind against the Congress, Rahul said addressing another rally at Damoh later. The Congress chief said while Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan speaks with decency, Modi lacks it whenever he attacks the Congress and his family members. ""When you hear Modi's speech, he uses wrong words and speaks with hatred... and also speaks lies. The faith reposed by the people and youths in them has broken. Now, when Modi comes, people say he will speak lies,"" Rahul said. ""He (Modi) speaks with hatred about me and my family, but Shivraj uses decent language. Modi doesn't know how to speak decently, but Rahul Gandhi will always maintain decency while speaking. Though Chouhan has indulged in corruption, whenever he says anything against us, he speaks with decency,"" he said. Chouhan knows that he is contesting this election only to lose. He is going to be defeated. But there is no hatred in his words, the Congress chief said. ""There is another person (Modi), who is afraid. The people have lost their faith (in Modi),"" Rahul said while addressing a gathering at Damoh. ""He (Modi) knows that he is going to be defeated in 2019. This has caused hatred in his heart. Wherever he is going, he is talking with hatred and anger. People know that this man is weak. This fear is converting into hatred. The entire country is watching,"" he said. Referring to the Vyapam scam, Gandhi said the youth in Madhya Pradesh were deprived of jobs as they did not have money to pay people involved in the scam. Those involved in the scam, included people from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Chouhan's family, he alleged. However, state BJP spokesperson Sarvesh Tiwari said, "" Rahul's statement on Vyapam is ridiculous. The matter came up in 2013, and even after that, the BJP won convincingly. It shows that the (Rahul's) allegations have no substance and made out for political purposes."" ""The CBI and various courts have also given clean chit in the case,"" he said. Speaking at a rally in Tikamgarh, Rahul said the slogans of the Modi government had changed after four years in power. ""Four years go, when Modi used to ask people 'achche din', (good days), they used to reply ""aayenge"" (will come). Now when we ask the people ""chowkidar"" (watchman), they reply 'chor hai' (is a thief),"" he said. Continuing his attack on Modi, Rahul said, ""Modi said he would become the 'chowkidar' (of people) but he did not tell the people whose 'chowkidar' he would be? He became the chowkidar of Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya."" 
He also accused the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh of corruption in implementing the Bundelkhand package. On 19 November, 2009, the Centre had approved a special package of Rs 7,266 crore for implementation of drought mitigation strategies in Bundelkhand region which falls in Madhya Pradesh as well as Uttar Pradesh. Under this package, Uttar Pradesh was allocated Rs 3,506 crore while Madhya Pradesh was to receive Rs 3,760 crore over a period of three years from 2009-10 to 2011-12. 
Narrating how a Congress worker had told him that a village woman has said that a 'tawa' (frying pan) stops working properly after 10 years, Gandhi asked the crowd to ensure the state government is unseated (in the polls). Chouhan has been chief minister since 2005 while the BJP has been in power in the state since 2003. He reiterated his allegations in the purchase of Rafale fighter jets, something that the Centre has continually refuted.",2018-11-24,"Assembly Election 2018,Assembly Polls,Madhya Pradesh,Narendra Modi,NewsTracker,Rafale,Rahul Gandhi,Rahul Gandhi In Madhya Pradesh,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Vidhan Sabha,Vyapam","Rahul Gandhi accuses Narendra Modi of 'betraying' people on promises of jobs, not depositing Rs 15 lakh in accounts",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-accuses-narendra-modi-of-betraying-people-on-promises-of-jobs-not-depositing-rs-15-lakh-in-accounts-5611121.html,firstpost,-1,0
Hema Vaishnavi,"Recently, in an election rally, caretaker chief minister and TDP leader KCR claimed that the intended project of the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy Lift Irrigation System (LIS) has been completed by around 90 percent. The project intended to supply irrigated water to around 12 lakh acres of land in the erstwhile combined district of Mahabubnagar. The government has spent nearly Rs 3,200 crores on the project so far. In the election rally KCR also claimed that nearly 8.5 lakh acres of land is being irrigated today, which is far from what is happening on the ground. Currently, a mere 3 lakh acres of land is being irrigated under the project. Out of this irrigated land, water is being supplied from the existing Koil Sagar, which was inaugurated in 1948 to at least 2,300 acres of land. The idea is to increase the irrigated land to 50,000 acres, and therefore water was diverted from the Jurala dam to Koil Sagar, but lack of proper irrigation channels has made it difficult to supply the water to the intended lands. A proposal is in place to lift water from the foreshore of Priyadarshini Jurala Project (PJP) in two stages. The proposed utilisation under this scheme is 2.06 TMC. In the first stage, water will be lifted from the foreshore of PJP (Chintareddy Palli) and dropped into Pardipur tank. In the second stage, the water stored in Pardipur tank will be lifted and dropped in Koil Sagar Reservoir. 
One of the biggest loopholes of the project has been that the existing reservoir channels don’t cover agricultural lands that it intends to irrigate. Under the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy LIS too, the KCR government is yet to complete construction of reservoir channels to take water to the targeted croplands, because of which water from this project is getting sidetracked and ending up getting wasted. Although this water is being used to fill 300 different lakes, creating an area of 20,000 acres of new ayacut, KCR is claiming that the water from the project has created 3.5 lakh acres of new ayacut even without creation of new irrigation channels.   Moreover, the Ministry of Forest and Environment gave clearance for stage I of the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy LIS covering 500 acres of forest land in April 2018. How then has the projected achieved 90 percent completion? The KCR government has claimed that the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy LIS water is meant for fields, but on numerous occasions and in the high court as well, it has said that Palamuru-Ranga Reddy LIS waters would also be used for filling up the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. Whereas, the official PRLIS report submitted to the Ministry of Environment, does not contain any mention of the Osman Sagar or the Himayat Sagar. In the past three decades, supply of water to the Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar lakes has been dwindling because of the low rainfall, and the existing channels are not opened to utilise water from these lakes. Hyderabad already feels the threat of water scarcity because of its exclusive dependence on water from Godavari and Krishna rivers. Won't the government's plan to link the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy LIS project to the lakes of Osman and Himayat Sagar further dry up the rivers? Also, the Telangana government hasn’t given any clarification as to how it plans to connect the project to the lakes which are at least 300 kilometers away.

Press Trust of India," Western Rajasthan's Pokhran assembly constituency is set for a close fight on 7 December between a Hindu religious leader fielded by the BJP and son of Muslim 'peer' pitted against him by the Congress. The BJP candidate, Pratap Puri, is the head of the Taratara 'math'. The Congress' Shale Mohammad is the son of Muslim religious leader Gazi Fakir, who has a large number of followers both within India and across the border in Pakistan. Both Puri and Fakir hold considerable sway among their communities, making the Pokhran constituency in Jaisalmer district one of the state's most hotly contested seats. Uttar Pradesh chief minister and senior BJP leader Yogi Adityanath and Congress President Rahul Gandhi will address rallies in support of Puri and Mohammad, respectively, on Monday, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign in the region better known for the nuclear tests in 1998. Puri expressed confidence that the BJP will win the Pokhran seat and blamed the Congress for making the contest ""communal"" by fielding a Muslim candidate against him. Protection of Hindus and cows has always been an important issue, he said. ""Hindutva is in my veins and the party is going to win the election which has been made communal by the Congress by fielding a Muslim candidate against me,"" the BJP candidate told  . Religious leaders should be in politics for its purification, Puri, who hails from the influential Rajput community, said. ""The people are with the BJP because they have faith in the party's policies and in leaders like Narendra Modi,"" he said. His Barmer-based 'math', which holds considerable influence in the entire Jodhpur division, is pulling out all stops to win over the electorate, conducting social and religious activities. ""We hold drug de-addiction camps, provide education to poor children and work for cow conservation, besides conducting several other social activities,"" Puri said. The Congress candidate, Mohammad, said his focus was core issues like drinking water and other basic amenities for people in Pokhran, which has a total electorate of 1.94 lakh. ""People here face difficulties in getting drinking water and fodder for cattle. The constituency lacks healthcare facilities and I am focusing on that,"" he said. Mohammad had lost the 2013 assembly elections from the same seat to BJP's Shaitan Singh with a margin of 34,444 votes. Mohammad's father, an octogenarian, boasts of a strong following in the Sindhi Muslim community and has several criminal cases against him. There are an estimated 55,000 Muslim voters, 45,000-48,000 and Rajput voters in Pokhran. It also has around 35,000 Dalit voters, according to the candidates. Pokhran is one of the two assembly constituencies of the desert district of Jaisalmer. The second constituency, Jaisalmer, will also see a direct contest between BJP candidate Sang Singh Bhati and Congress' Roopa Ram. The BJP chose Sang Singh Bhati over its sitting MLA Chotu Singh Bhati, while the Congress has fielded Ram for the second time after 2013.

Press Trust of India," Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted the Nehru-Gandhi family on Saturday, saying farmers would not have been ""ruined"" had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel been the country's first prime minister. Addressing a rally here in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, he blamed the Congress-led governments of the past for the agrarian crisis. ""Generations of farmers have suffered due to the sins and wrong policies of the Congress, but now, our governments are being defamed,"" Modi told the gathering. ""The farmers in India would not have been ruined under the Congress's 55-year rule, had Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel been the country's first prime minister."" ""It is true that we need some time to correct the mistakes of five-six decades. I have just got four years. Even if I get half the time they had, I will bring about a drastic change,"" he said. Modi also accused the Congress of making false promises and raised questions over late prime minister Indira Gandhi's "" "" (remove poverty) slogan. The prime minister's comments came in the backdrop of Congress president Rahul Gandhi accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of ""making false promises"" to people during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. ""The grandmother of ' ' (Rahul Gandhi), Shrimati Indira Gandhi, was the prime minister of the country. Didn't she give the slogan to remove poverty 40 years ago?"" ""Tell me honestly, has poverty been eradicated? Wasn't this a false promise? Were those who made the promise not liars?"" he asked the gathering. Modi also said the move to nationalise banks did not benefit the poor as was claimed by the Indira Gandhi regime. The prime minister also referred to a video clip purportedly showing Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath, saying that the Congress leader seeking votes only from a ""particular community"" was an insult to democracy. A video clip surfaced last week, purportedly showing Nath telling Muslim leaders to ensure ""90 percent voting"" in Muslim-dominated areas. Modi also ridiculed Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress chief was not being taken seriously by his own party. Hailing Sardar Patel as a farmers' leader ""in the true sense"", he asked the peasants from Mandsaur to visit the Statue of Unity — the late leader's gigantic statue in Gujarat, which was inaugurated last month. Mandsaur has been a hotbed of farmers' agitation. It witnessed intense protests by farmers for better support prices for their produce last year, leading to the death of six protesters in police firing. Farmers in Karnataka, being ruled by the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress alliance, were jailed for seeking loan waiver, and the Congress's pre-poll promise of farm loan waiver in that state was another ""lie"", the prime minister said. He also picked holes in the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government's farm loan waiver scheme of 2008, claiming that it did not cover the deserving farmers. Labelling the previous Manmohan Singh government as ""a remote-controlled government by Madam (UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi)"", Modi said it gave loans to farmers at an interest rate of 15-16 percent, whereas the BJP governments were giving interest-free loans to them. His government was committed to empowering farmers, the prime minister said, and reiterated that it would double their income by 2022.

Press Trust of India," Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Saturday attacked Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje on the issue of corruption and claimed that the state government led by her patronised the liquor, land and sand mafia. The AICC general secretary, who is contesting the 7 December elections from Jodhpur's Sardarpura seat, is conducting electioneering in Mewar region for the party. ""No government in Rajasthan had ever patronised any mafia but the Vasundhara Raje government did that.

Instead of bowing before Shah, she should have taken care of the people of Rajasthan who gave such a huge mandate in the 2013 elections. But she betrayed the people,” the former Rajasthan chief minister said. Gehlot alleged that the BJP government in five years only worked to weaken schemes launched by former Congress government and stalled various important projects in the state. “During the Congress government rule, there were 25 lakh people engaged in MGNREGA works, but now the number has reduced to just 2.5 lakh,” he said. Gehlot alleged that the government spent crores of rupees on Resurgent Rajasthan and now the government should disclose that how much investment was made in the state in five years.

Press Trust of India," Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said Indians have realised that there is no substance in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks, adding that the latter is mum on the issues he spoke about before the 2014 elections. Addressing a campaign rally in Vidisha for the 28 November Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls, Rahul said that Modi's speeches used to be about corruption, farmers and unemployment. ""Today, he doesn't say anything on these issues. People of the country have realised that there is no substance in what Modi speaks. All his assurances are false,"" Rahul added. ""Before 2014, Modi had promised loan waiver, bonus and better price for farmers' produce; I want to ask him why were the assurances not fulfilled,"" he said. ""When the Congress forms the next government in Madhya Pradesh, the chief minister will work for 18 hours a day to provide employment to the youth, Gandhi further said.

Press Trust of India,": Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he felt a deep sense of anguish at the Congress ""abusing"" North East culture and calling its dress ""outlandish"". Coming down heavily on the rival party at an election rally at Lunglei, he also said that the country has understood the ""divide and rule"" policy of the Congress and that is the reason the party was just confined to two to three states. Mizoram in the North East is the last bastion of the Congress. Election to the 40-member assembly is scheduled for 28 November. ""The Congress party, which once governed maximum number of states, is now restricted to just two or three states. Now, the people of Mizoram have a golden opportunity to rid themselves of this Congress culture,"" Modi said. The priority for Congress is not the people of Mizoram, it is fighting to gain power, the prime minister charged. ""I feel deep sense of anguish when I see a Congress leader abused traditional dress of northeast states, calling them outlandish. Your hopes, ambitions do not matter to the Congress. Their priority is power and not the people of Mizoram,"" he stated.

Why does he always refuse to wear a Muslim skull cap? Tharoor had stated. ""You see him in Naga headgears with feathers. You have seen him in various kinds of extraordinary outfits which is a right thing for a prime minister to do. Indira Gandhi has also been photographed wearing various kinds of costumes. But why he still always says no to one?,” Tharoor had stated.

Sanjay Singh,"CP Joshi's straight-out casteist remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister Uma Bharti — implying that because of their low caste origins, they didn't qualify to be from the Hindu community, never mind speak about Hinduism — has given ammunition to the BJP that might prove fatal for the Congress in the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha elections. The former Union minister and one of the Congress' contenders for the chief ministerial berth in Rajasthan may end up earning the distinction of creating a ""Joshi moment"" for these elections just as there was or a Sonia Gandhi "" "" moment the in 2007 Gujarat election or a Mani Shankar Aiyar "" "" Modi moment in the 2017 Gujarat election or a Mohan Bhagwat moment in the 2015 Bihar election that tilted the outcome of the election. Although Joshi has some competition from within the Congress — Kamal Nath allegedly telling Muslim community leaders in a closed-door meeting that if 90 percent of Muslims didn't vote for the Congress, the party would suffer immense damage and Raj Babbar dragging Modi's mother into the election campaign, the Rajasthan leader's remark towers over everything else. Let's revisit what Joshi said at an election rally in Rajasthan: ""What is Uma Bharti's caste, does anybody know that? What is Ritambhara's caste? If anyone knows about   in this country then it is a Pandit. A Pandit is Brahmin. It has turned bizarre in this country. Bharti is from the Lodhi caste (an OBC), but she will speak about Hindu  ; Sadhvi (Rithambhara) may be from any religion but she will speak about the Hindu religion. Modi ’s religion may be anything but he will speak about the Hindu religion. Does the Brahmin have no work?"" Joshi, a Brahmin is questioning Modi and Bharti's right to speak about Hinduism because the two belonged to the category of Other Backward Castes. He clearly forgot the famous couplet by the 15th Century poet and saint Kabir, "" ,  … (Don't ask the caste of seers, ask for their knowledge)"". Bharti and Rithambhara are   and have been reciting religious discourse since childhood. Modi, born in a humble OBC family, has risen through the ranks due to sheer personal grit and hard work, and many take him as the biggest Hindutava leader of modern times, as also as a 'Hindu Hriday Samrat'. The BJP could not have let this issue go. It quickly turned it into a major electoral issue, holding a series of press conferences, referring to it at a public rally and commenting on it on social media in a big way. : ""Shameful statement by Congress Leader CP Joshi. Implies what does a lower caste person like Modi know about Hinduism as only Brahmins are true custodians of Hinduism"". He also attached a 25-second video of Joshi's remarks. The Congress now realises the damage potential of Joshi's statement and Rahul Gandhi swung into action to issue a clarification of the party's position: Joshi expressed regret and for the Congress, the issue ended there. Joshi didn't say sorry. He only expressed regret if his statement had hurt sentiments of any section of society: The Congress has for some time been trying to reclaim the Brahmanical position for the Congress by painting Rahul as a ""Janeudhari Brahmin"". The Congress thus far was trying to push soft Hindutva. But what Joshi has said looks like a strong advocation of Hindutva: First, claiming that the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya could only be built by the Congress and its prime minister. He based his claim on a contentious fact that Rajiv Gandhi had the locks of Babri Masjid broken in 1986 (in the portion where the statue of Ramlala was installed in December 1949) and now claims that only a Brahmin like him could talk and define Hinduism. The problem for Congress is four-fold: First, since Joshi has named Modi to claim that his caste disqualifies him from talking about Hinduism, he has handed the BJP an emotive issue on a platter. Second, Brahmins are important social constituents, but unlike as in Uttar Pradesh, in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, they are not going to be the key decisive factor in the electoral outcome. Third, most Brahmins have long shifted their preference from the Congress to the BJP. Despite the Congress trying hard to establish Brahmin credentials for Rahul, given his lineage as the grandson of Indira and Feroze Gandhi and son of Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi, his caste credentials are a matter of public debate. Four, when one party aggressively tries to woo one dominant caste and community, there is the possibility of other castes and communities becoming polarised in favour of the other party.",2018-11-23,"Addiction Free Madhya Pradesh,Airtel Madhya Pradesh,BJP,Brahmins,Congress,CP Joshi,Hindutva,InMyOpinion,Narendra Modi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha Election,Uma Bharti","CP Joshi's casteist comment is his 'Mani Shankar Aiyar moment'; may cost Congress MP, Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/cp-joshis-casteist-comment-is-his-mani-shankar-aiyar-moment-may-cost-congress-mp-rajasthan-vidhan-sabha-polls-5604961.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The TDP on Friday hit back at Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for his repeated attacks on its president N Chandrababu Naidu, calling it a ""panic reaction"". TDP politburo member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy asserted it was under Naidu's helmsmanship of undivided Andhra Pradesh that the present-day Telangana capital Hyderabad developed exponentially and now accounted for 64 pe cent of the state's income. ""On September 6 (the day the Assembly was dissolved) he (Rao) said TDP has a mere 0.2 percent vote share in Telangana. Now he is devoting 50 percent of his speech time criticising Naidu and the TDP. It shows his panic reaction and frustration,"" Reddy told  . Rao, the ruling TRS president, and other party leaders have frequently targeted Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, calling him an outsider and anti-Telangana leader who created hurdles in the way of Telangana's development during his stewardship of the undivided state. The TDP is fighting a do-or-die battle in the Assembly elections in Telangana where it had clinched 15 seats in the 2014 polls in alliance with the BJP. It had bagged 14.7 percent votes. However, 13 of the TDP MLAs deserted the party with 12 defecting to TRS and one to the Congress. After snapping ties with the BJP-led NDA, Naidu's TDP has forged a pre-poll coalition with the Congress, CPI and Telangana Jana Samiti. TRS leaders, who often accuse Naidu of blocking irrigation schemes in the Telangana region as the chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh, warn people against voting for the opposition coalition, saying the TDP boss will call the shots if it is voted to power. Despite its hugely depleted strength in the dissolved Assembly following a spate of defections, Reddy claimed the cadre was with the TDP. ""We are confident of winning the 13 seats that we are 
contesting now,"" he said. As the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh Naidu worked hard for the all-round development of Hyderabad, particularly in the information technology sector, Reddy said.

Sandipan Sharma,"CP Joshi must be really good at hopping around on one foot. This can be safely presumed because his one foot is invariably stuck in his mouth that is used to uttering words that either lead to avoidable controversies or win him a loyal battalion of enemies. It is a pity that Joshi suffers from the foot-in-mouth syndrome because his mentor, former Congress chief minister Mohan Lal Sukhadia, was the perfect practitioner of the art of not saying a word, something that he achieved by always stuffing his mouth with  . Remember Pankaj Kapoor in Maqbool advising a politician,  The problem with Joshi is that he likes to think aloud, sometimes forgetting that what should remain in the private recesses of his mind should not be uttered in public. But Joshi, who loves the sound of his own voice, is fascinated by the self-presumed brilliance of his own logic and believes that everyone other than him is in dire need of being educated by him. So, give him an audience, put him up on a stage and Joshi would just let his tongue loose. That’s exactly what has happened with his recent  . Those who know him can safely wager he was overawed by the occasion and blurted out specious arguments like: Only Brahmins and intellectuals can talk about Hinduism; that people like Uma Bharati had no business talking about the religion because they are, unlike him, not Brahmins. The impromptu lecture, like all of Joshi’s soliloquies, must have been an impulsive thought donated for public consumption because of his compulsive desire to sound pedagogic. Joshi, don’t forget, is a former university teacher. And, as they say, you can make a politician out of a professor but you can never take the professor out of a politician. Also, Joshi is a worshipper of Che Guevara and considers himself a revolutionary in the same mould. This contradictory mishmash of Brahminical upbringing in a holy city — Nathadwara, penchant for teaching and Marxist moorings often makes Joshi sound a confused philosopher who speaks too much for his own good. Just like Mani Shankar Aiyyar, another Congress leader with a misplaced sense of entitlement and the hubris typical of those who believe themselves to be twice born — once as themselves and the second time as self-styled beacons of intellect. Joshi’s problem is that his penchant for speaking too much in his trademark style that makes him sound angry and arrogant even when he is not, has made his career look like a game of snakes and ladders. Just a few months ago, he was Rahul Gandhi’s trusted lieutenant, a powerful general secretary in charge of key states. Before that, even though he was a first-term parliamentarian, Joshi was inducted as a Cabinet minister in UPA-II, a privilege accorded to him because of the belief that Rahul Gandhi was learning the art and craft of politics under Joshi’s tutelage. But, just as his career was hovering near the peak, he was bitten by the proverbial snake. Today, he is on the margins, stripped of power in the Congress and relegated to backbenches in Rajasthan Congress, where he was once seen as potential chief minister. His utterances on Hinduism and the argument that only a Congress-led government can build a Ram Temple at Ayodhya may, of course, have been a manifestation of his subconscious desire to catch the attention of the Congress president, give words to the party’s current drive to embrace soft Hindutva. But, it is quite likely that he made these pronouncements without weighing his own logic, misled by the tragic belief that everything coming out of his mouth is profound and deeply philosophical. The reporter had once asked Joshi which is his favourite song and film. He said the Uttam Kumar classic   is the closest to his heart and its immortal song,  , his favorite. He then quickly clarified that it wasn’t because his heart was broken irreparably in youth but only because of the quality of the film and the lyricism and poetry of the song. Now, that he has created an unnecessary controversy by arguing for Brahminical superiority, released the djinn of Ram Mandir from the Congress bottle, Joshi would have many reasons to sing his favourite song. His dream—he still had an outside chance—of becoming the next chief minister is now gone, something that will shatter his heart. He would be lucky if his words do not end up breaking the heart of Rahul Gandhi by letting the BJP turn Joshi into the Aiyyar of Rajasthan—the man who shot his own party from the lip.",2018-11-23,"Assembly Election 2018,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Brahmins,CP Joshi,Mani Shankar Aiyar,Narendra Modi,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2019,Rajasthan Elections,Rajasthan Polls",CP Joshi shoots from hip again: Rahul Gandhi's trusted aide releases Ram Mandir genie from Congress bottle,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/cp-joshi-shoots-from-the-hip-again-rahul-gandhis-trusted-lieutenant-has-released-the-ram-mandir-genie-from-congress-bottle-5604501.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao Friday attacked TDP president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu calling him anti-Telangana while also slamming the Congress-TDP coalition for the December 7 state polls. The BJP leader alleged Naidu's 'influence' in any manner in Telangana is going to hurt the state's development. ""In 2014 itself, the BJP understood the way he (Chandrababu) was functioning that he is working against Telangana...we have suffered because of that and immediately we have distanced unilaterally and came out of that partnership,"" Rao told reporters in Hyderabad. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) had an alliance with the BJP during 2014 elections in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Attacking the Congress-TDP alliance, Rao said, ""Definitely, it will have serious implications and negative consequences for Telangana and its people. The BJP wants Chandrababu Naidu-mukt Telangana...we have become free from his influence...and we want to retain it. We will not allow any kind of this influence coming into the Telangana governance. ""It is the Congress which has to take a decision... the Congress has become covert to Chandrababu Naidu,"" he alleged. For the BJP, the upcoming Assembly elections in Telangana are very important in the context of the south, Rao said, adding ""We have a kind of ambition to expand in South. We have an abiding commitment for development of Telangana."" Rao also accused the TRS of failing to fulfill its promises and said anti-TRS campaigns will be taken up extensively by the party's national leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, central ministers, chief ministers of BJP-ruled states and over 100 public meetings will be organised in the coming days. The TRS and the Congress are ""family first"" parties while the BJP stands for nation first, he claimed. ""Earlier, TRS president and caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had met Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and later Chandrababu and other ' ' (grand alliance) leaders also met Kumaraswamy.

Press Trust of India,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of bringing ignominy to all ""chowkidars"" (watchmen) in the country. Addressing campaign rallies for the 28 November Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rahul said the situation now is such that whenever the word ""chowkidar'""is uttered, people say "" "" (is a thief). ""Wherever you go, as you pronounce the word ""chowkidar"" comes a reply ""chor hai"". I want to apologise to the chowkidars of the country. It is not your mistake, you all are not thieves, you all are honest. Only one person has brought ignominy to you. The country's prime minister has defamed all its chowkidars,"" he said. Before coming to power in 2014, Modi used to talk about combating corruption, unemployment and farmers' welfare but is now mum on these issues, Rahul said. The sentiment across the country is that he broke their trust, he added. When Modi gave the ""acche din"" (good days) slogan ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, people would respond to the catch-phrase, saying ""aayenge"" (will come), he said. The promised ""acche din"" were not meant for the people but for some top industrialists, Rahul said. Good days have come for industrialists like Nirav Modi, Anil Ambani and Vijay Mallya, he added. Modi, in his election campaign in 2014, had said he wanted to be the country's chowkidar, not the prime minister. ""People had then reposed faith in him. The youth were assured two crore jobs, farmers were assured minimum support price for their produce, the entire India was assured that Rs 15 lakh would be deposited in the bank account of each citizen. People believed this then,"" he said. ""Why has this changed? In four years, people found that these (promises) were false. Narendra Modi speaks lies. This is the sentiment in the country, because he has broken the (people's) trust,"" Rahul said. A ""Congress wave"" would sweep Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana, he said. The BJP-led government waived loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of the rich, but did not write off farmers' debts, he said. The previous Congress-led UPA government, on the recommendation of the Indian Air Force, decided to purchase 126 Rafale fighters at a cost of Rs 526 crore per plane with the stipulation that the state-owned aerospace company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) would make them in India, the Congress chief said. ""But Modi went to France and conveyed to the French government that each Rafale jet will be purchased for Rs 1600 crore. He told them to give the contract to (Anil) Ambani instead of giving it to HAL,"" he said. There was no immediate reaction from the BJP on the allegations. The ruling party has dismissed the charges in the past. The Congress president asked his party men to stand at polling booths and not back off ""even an inch"" to convey a message to the BJP that people of Madhya Pradesh are now with the principal Opposition party. Rahul, who faces a defamation suit for claiming that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's son was named in the 'Panama Papers', said, ""I spoke mistakenly that Shivraj ji's son was named in Panama Papers, actually it was Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh's son. Shivraj ji threatened me of filing defamation suit."" ""But when I talk about scams like e-tendering, Vyapam, illegal mining and mid-day meal scam, he (Shivraj) doesn't speak a word, he doesn't threaten to file defamation. What does it mean,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,": Rejecting Congress leader CP Joshi's apology for his casteist remarks, the BJP on Friday said party president Rahul Gandhi must take responsibility and express regret. Stressing that Joshi had ""insulted the Indian culture as well as the Hindu religion"", Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of ""dividing every religion for power"".

Press Trust of India," Days after accusing the media of misconstruing his remark against a woman farmer, an upset Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Thursday said he would not address the press hereafter ""for any reason."" The chief minister, who has often hit out at the media for ""misinterpreting"" his comments, said he would ""limit the media to what I speak from the stage."" ""From here on, I will limit the media to what I speak from the stage. I have decided. I will not address the press for any reason. If you want, write or else, leave it,"" he said.

Recently, during the sugarcane farmers' protest too, he had accused the media of instigating protesters and blamed the scribes for wrongly interpreting his statement against a woman farmer. Kumaraswamy had earlier courted controversy following his government's decision to impose certain restrictions on the entry of visitors, including the media, to the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of state legislature and secretariat. He had cited police inputs regarding security as also increase in the number of people visiting it everyday besides complaints about inconvenience caused to ministers and officials to carry out their work as reasons for the move then.

FP Staff," Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP are afflicted with a ""disease"" that has caused ""communal madness"" and prompted them to block enhanced job quotas for Muslims in Telangana, TRS chief K Chandrashekar Rao said Friday, as poll-time rhetoric got shriller and nastier. Rao, the caretaker chief minister, slammed the Centre for keeping on hold a decision on raising reservations for Muslims and Scheduled Tribes from 4 to 12 percent and 6 to 10 percent in state government jobs and educational institutions despite the state Assembly passing a resolution. ""Narendra Modi and the BJP have a disease...In everything they see, they see Hindu-Muslim (divide). They don't see anything else and so they did not do it (raise the quotas)...they have kept it pending,"" he told an election rally at Narsampet. Addressing another election meeting in Mahabubabad, the TRS president repeated his charge and accused the Centre of ""religious madness"". ""Narendra Modi government has a disease. That is minorities (versus) Hindus....they are in that state of 'mataparamaina pichi' (communal madness)). It is because of this they blocked reservations for STs and Muslims,"" he said. Rao said he will ensure that the demand for raising the quotas was accepted if people elected TRS candidates from all the 17 Lok Sabha seats of Telangana in 2019. ""Not only the Assembly elections...with kindness, help us win all 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana. Only if we win can we make Delhi bend its neck. We will get our ST reservation, we will get our Muslim reservation,"" he said. The TRS leader claimed both the BJP and the Congress wanted to exercise complete control over the states. ""It doesn't matter which of the two parties forms the government at the Centre. Their attitude is the same. Both Congress and the BJP want to concentrate all powers over states into their hands. This is their culture,"" he said. Rao once again batted for a non-Congress, non-BJP ""federal front"" government at the Centre to end that culture. The TRS chief, who has been assailing the Congress-led Opposition coalition that includes Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, asked people at his Narasampet rally whether Telangana needed Naidu. He has been accusing Naidu of stalling the development of Telangana when it was part of undivided Andhra Pradesh. He hit out at the Congress for merging the Telangana region with Andhra against the wishes of the people of Telangana. He also accused the Congress government of suppressing the agitation for a separate Telangana in 1969.

FP Staff,"With less than a week to go for the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha elections, political heavyweights have reached the state to address election rallies in strategic Assembly constituencies. Prime Minister   will address a rally in Mandsaur, BJP president Amit Shah will address a gathering in Chhindwara, while Congress president   will hold three back-to-back rallies in Vidisha and Sehore, considered as the home turf of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Mandsaur had been the epicentre of the   and mob violence in June 2017, that led to the death of six farmers in police firing. The protest by farmers has come as a challenge for Chouhan, who calls himself a "" "" (poor farmer’s son). While the state BJP hopes that Modi's visit will boost its chances, the state Congress has questioned the prime minister's visit by asking, “Where was Modi when Mandsaur was on fire and six farmers were killed? Does he have the right to ask for votes from the people of Mandsaur?” On the other hand, Amit Shah will hold a rally in Chhindwara – the parliamentary constituency and pocket borough of MPCC president Kamal Nath, from where he has been elected to the Lok Sabha ten times. A Congress stronghold, Chhindwara has seven Assembly seats. According to political analysts, while this election would   for the ruling BJP in the last 15 years, it will be equally crucial for the Congress, which has been out of power since 2003. On Friday, Rahul will hold three back-to-back public meetings at Basoda in Vidisha district, at industrial town Mandideep in Raisen, and Nasrullaganj in Sehore. The Vidisha Lok Sabha constituency has eight Assembly segments — Budhni, Vidisha, Ichhawar, Silwani, Basoda, Khategaon, Bhojpur and Sanchi. During the last election, Chouhan won both from Vidisha and Budhni (Sehore district), and retained the latter. However, of late, the chief minister has been facing the heat from the voters of Budhni. Recently, when Chouhan’s wife Sadhna Singh visited Budhni, she had to face the ire of the locals, who complained to her about the lack of basic amenities like drinking water, etc in the area. The state unit of the Congress is expecting that Rahul’s visit to Basoda in Vidisha and Nasrullaganj, which is in Budhni (Sehore) will turn the tables in favour of the party. The importance of Budhni cannot be underestimated as Arun Yadav, former MPCC president and Union minister of state during the UPA-I regime, has been pitted against Chouhan. Besides Madhya Pradesh, Rahul will also address a public meeting at Medchal in Telangana. However, for the Congress in Telangana, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi's rally on Friday at the same place will be the most important one. Her visit will be the first since the state was formed in June 2014. Telangana is important for the Congress, as it was the UPA which had approved the bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh, when Sonia was the Congress president. She had played a vital role in the creation of the state. The Telangana Congress will also release its ‘people’s manifesto’ on Friday.

Press Trust of India,": Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday accused the BJP-led NDA government of converting the Central Bureau of Investigation into a ""collection bureau"" and damaging the independence of the Reserve Bank of India.

""An official of the CBI himself revealed the Prime Ministers Office's interference in the agency's functioning. The official filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on the interference of (National Security Adviser) Ajit Doval and the Union Law secretary,"" the CM said, referring to CBI DIG Manish Kumar Sinha's petition in the apex court levelling allegations against various top functionaries in the Alok Verma case.

Tara Kartha,"Desperation can take many forms. Some hit their heads against the wall, others throw stones, and yet others form political coalitions. Just months ago, anyone suggesting that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the National Conference (NC) would come together on a common plank would have been hooted down as a novice on Kashmir affairs. Yet there it is, in black and white and on Twitter too, in case anyone has any doubts. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti tweeted her letter staking a claim to form the government after she alleged all communication with Raj Bhawan was cut off. Late Wednesday evening, Governor Satya Pal Malik announced the dissolution of the Assembly. Given the timing of the action, the governor’s motives seemed questionable. Now it seems that “black and white” is not so reliable after all. Mehbooba’s claim that she had the numbers (56) to form the government with the support of Congress and the National Conference was denied by Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Nabi Azad, who noted that his own party and NC met separately only a day earlier, and that no decision was taken on forming a grand coalition. NC leader Omar Abdullah stated he had provided no “documentary support” to the PDP. That pulls the rug from under Mehbooba, and the argument that the governor acted specifically to stop her. But the fact remains, that the governor—who’s remit is to get political parties to form a government as soon as possible—dissolved the Assembly at a time when the political activity was apparently occurring. It is worth examining the governor’s statements. First, he said he received no claims of government formation from anyone, and that the fax machine was probably not attended to on a holiday. It is true that everything moves at snail's pace in the state, particularly in government offices. But this particular statement is likely to make it quickly into history books. Second, he says it was the political parties themselves who wanted the Assembly dissolved, and which is immediately apparent in repeated statements by all concerned. The third argument is a little unsound in legal terms. The governor said he dissolved the Assembly to prevent unseemly horse-trading. If that were true, nearly every state election in India should be declared null and void. But that there was horse trading going on can't be denied. Mehbooba has raised it, and the sight of party stalwarts like Imran Reza Ansari defecting to the “Third Front” of the Sajad Lone-BJP combine is there for everyone to see. Horse-trading is nothing new, with MPs herded into resorts and hotels in various states. In Kashmir, however, this can quickly devolve into a bullets and grenades exercise. The fourth argument, as stated clearly in the Raj Bhawan’s statement is: “The impossibility of forming a stable government by the coming together of political parties with opposing political ideologies including some which have been demanding dissolution of the Assembly”. An examination of the party manifestos certainly indicates opposing ideologies: the PDP for instance centers its demands around “self-rule”, including closer ties across the Line of Control, a position that would be unacceptable to the Congress. But that did not prevent earlier coalitions under the late patriarch Mufti Mohammed Sayeed. The governor’s statement is not much of an argument. There is undoubtedly considerable truth in the view that a government cobbled to bring together such unsuitable allies as the NC and PDP would have had little chance of sustainability, particularly at the ground level. However, the point is that it is not up to the governor to take that call, even though legally, he assumes authority for “any or all of the powers vested in or exercisable” by any body of the State, which includes the safety and security of the State. It's a bit of a tangle, and really hinges on which side of the Raj Bhawan gate you are on. Finally, the governor is right that stone throwing and other types of violence have reduced considerably; the armed forces have upscaled actions against terrorists, leading to confusion among militant ranks; and the holding of the first phase of Panchayat elections at a reported 62 percent turnout seems to indicate a desire for some initial stability. And here’s the thing: Anyone travelling in Kashmir during these different phases can attest to the disillusionment of the average Kashmiri against all parties, who are seen as predatory and corrupt. It's too early to say whether a Third Front will be successful or not. It might succeed if BJP leaders in Delhi keep out of the tangle entirely, and refrain from incautious allegations. Finally, what is apparent is that the immediate fallout of the drama is that governor’s rule will expire mid-January, after which it will probably be extended as “President’s rule”, since it would be too soon for elections to be held. There is very little difference between these two nomenclatures in actual terms. Time enough for everyone to prove their muscularity.

The move came after three mainstream parties — PDP, National Conference, and Congress — formed an alliance to stake claim to form a government, followed by another bid from BJP-backed Peoples Conference. Governor Satya Pal Malik drew flak from various political parties over his move. Though the PDP-NC-Congress criticised him and the Centre heavily, the BJP said it favoured polls at the earliest. Here are some of the reactions on the issue: PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said that her party had been demanding the dissolution of the Assembly for the past five months. ""Oddly enough our pleas fell on deaf ears. But who would have thought that the very idea of a grand coalition would give such jitters,"" she said in a series of tweets. National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said that the issuance of governor's order coming just minutes after Mufti's letter to him ""can't be a coincidence"".   The BJP claimed that PDP and Congress had contradictory stands on the dissolution and said the best option in Jammu and Kashmir is to have fresh Assembly polls at the earliest. ""This Assembly cannot produce a stable government,"" it said in a series of tweets. It termed the proposed alliance of the three parties as a ""combination of terror-friendly parties""  BJP leader Ram Madhav   on Thursday after alleging that the PDP and National Conference ""probably had fresh instructions from across the border (Pakistan) to come together and form the government"". He later   after clashing with Abdullah on Twitter. Terming the decision to dissolve the Assembly as ""unconstitutional, immoral and unethical"", Congress leader Manish Tewari Thursday said it was a ""murder of democracy"".    Congress leader P Chidambaram also took a swipe at Malik's decision to dissolve the Assembly.  Veteran politician Sharad Yadav on Thursday called the dissolution of Jammu and Kashmir Assembly a ""murder of democracy"". ""Democracy has been murdered in Jammu and Kashmir by dissolving the aAsembly. I oppose and condemn the dissolution,"" said Yadav, currently heading his political outfit Loktantri Janata Dal, which he formed after parting ways with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led janata Dal (United) in 2016. Yadav said the BJP neither cares for the Constitution nor it has any respect for various institutions of the country. ""What is the meaning of an election when the people's mandate was to be butchered by dissolving the Assembly? Similarly there is no meaning of the local bodies polls when the major political parties did not participate in it,"" he added. He said several things happening during the BJP's regime are against the democracy and mandate of the people. ""People are fed up with the state of affairs in the country. I am unable to understand why the ruling party is not mending its way despite criticism of their actions by people from all walks of life,"" he added. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday described as Malik's action as ""undemocratic and anti-people"". The governor had a constitutional obligation to allow an opportunity for the PDP to prove its claims of majority. However, it was not examined, Vijayan said in a Facebook post. It is clear that the decision to dissolve the legislature, which had two more years left in its tenure, was taken when it became evident that a non-BJP government was going to be formed, he said. He alleged that the whole affair can be only be viewed as a ""political game orchestrated by the Central government using governors as pawns."" ""The Jammu and Kashmir policy of the Central government is quite malevolent. The Centre is using the problems of Kashmir as a means for communal polarisation. These measures will only help alienate the people there,"" Vijayan said. 
 The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) condemned the dissolution of the Assembly. ""The action of the governor, dissolving the legislative Assembly, at the behest of the Centre, is an illegal and unconstitutional step,"" a CPM statement said. ""The governor has no business to decide that parties with 'opposing ideologies' cannot form a suitable government... All that the governor can do is to ask the leader who is staking claim with majority support to prove that majority on the floor of the House. ""By taking this authoritarian measure, the Narendra Modi government has further complicated and worsened the situation in the state,"" the statement said.",2018-11-22,"BJP,Congress,Jammu And Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,NC,Omar Abdullah,PDP,People's Conference,Ram Madhav,TheySaidIt","J&K Assembly dissolved: Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah slam governor; BJP says early polls are best option",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jk-assembly-dissolved-mehbooba-mufti-omar-abdullah-slam-governor-bjp-says-early-polls-are-best-option-5599481.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ishfaq Naseem,"The National Conference (NC) and Congress have slammed Jammu and Kashmir governor   over the dissolution of the state Assembly. However, the statements of the two parties in the aftermath of the decision have raised doubts on whether the grand alliance of the NC, Congress and PDP would have lasted for long in the state. The decision of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti to stake claim for government formation has, however, prevented a split in her party and could even notch up the electoral prospects of the PDP. The governor dissolved the Assembly after claiming that he had received reports of horse-trading, and expressed fears that such a government would not have been stable. Following this, former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the PDP's proposal to form the government was ""only at a suggestion stage."" “There was no final decision on the formation of the government. We had sought a meeting on 23 November on the suggestion,” said Azad. However, the abortive bid by Mufti to form the government has given her party a leg up in the state. Mufti wrote a letter to the governor claiming the support of both the Congress and NC for government formation, even when the other two parties had said that the final shape of the coalition government had not been worked out. On Wednesday, senior PDP leader Altaf Bukhari was not forthcoming about the details which had been worked out on the formation of an alliance. Though Bukhari was believed to have met Abdullah to discuss the alliance, he said, “It was an absolutely non-political meeting. I had called on him on Eid-e-Milad-un Nabi to wish him.” He, however, said that the NC, Congress and PDP have agreed to form the coalition to defend the special identity of the state “politically and legally.” However, Mufti's claim to form the government has checked the rebellion within the PDP, and has also given the party ammunition to take on the BJP. PDP chief spokesperson Rafi Ahmad Mir, in response to a tweet on the dissolution of the Assembly, described the action of the governor as an “unconstitutional move in haste that is nothing but abuse of constitutional powers.” Abdullah said that the NC's support to the PDP helped the latter party. “People were telling us that we were giving a new life to the PDP. We knew that the support to the PDP would have caused a major loss to the NC, but we set aside the interests of our party and thought about the interests of our state only,” he said. The claim for government formation will also make the NC’s attacks on the PDP for running an alliance with the BJP less convincing. Instead, the flurry of activity both prior to and after the dissolution of the Assembly has thrown up a new political alignment in the state. It is for the first time that two regional rival parties, NC and PDP, have come together. In the wake of a tie-up between the BJP and the People’s Conference and the saffron party’s inroads in Kashmir, the new rallying slogan for political parties in the state seems to be to preserve Jammu and Kashmir's special political status, and also keep the BJP away from power. Congress state vice-president GN Monga said that the party ""will fight to preserve the special status of the state."" He asserted, ""We will never allow the BJP to make inroads in the state. We will fight for the protection of Article 35A, as it was the Congress which gave the provision to the state.”",2018-11-22,"Article 35a,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Jammu And Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,Omar Abdullah,PDP,Satya Pal Malik",J&K Assembly dissolution: Mehbooba Mufti checks rebellion in PDP camp with abortive bid to form government,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jk-assembly-dissolution-mehbooba-mufti-checks-rebellion-in-pdp-camp-with-abortive-bid-to-form-government-5600261.html,firstpost,-1,0
Praveen Swami,"“He is a liar, a curse on our nation.” Sajad Gani Lone spat out the words in 2008, as anti-India violence tore Kashmir apart, after the state’s Islamic patriarch, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, accused him of preparing to betray the secessionist cause, and contest elections. Less than six months later, though, Lone announced his candidacy for the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency and, today, is at the centre of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s plans to plant its flag in the Valley. Lone has long been written off as a bit-actor in Kashmir’s savage political story: an opportunist, his critics allege, lacking ideological and even moral fibre. This much is clear, though: he’s certain he belongs centre stage. For an understanding of Lone’s political trajectory, one has to turn to events that began in the late-1990s, when the Islamist insurgency in Kashmir began to reach an impasse. Early in 1997, the former head of the Jamaat-e-Islami—the organisation which birthed the Hizbul Mujahideen—stunned observers by publicly criticising what he called “gun culture”. He instead called for “a political dialogue” to end the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. In 1999, All Parties Hurriyat Conference leader Abdul Gani Butt called for a dialogue between secessionist and pro-India political groups; the following year, Hurriyat centrists helped facilitate a unilateral ceasefire by dissident Hizbul commander Abdul Majid Dar. Following the near-war that erupted after the Jaish-e-Mohammed’s attack on Parliament House in New Delhi, General Pervez Musharraf’s regime threw its weight behind these efforts: the Bill for the jihad in Kashmir was starting to look too high. Lone’s father, Abdul Gani Lone, sought to use these new circumstances to build a consensus for negotiations. In April 2002, he travelled to Sharjah for discussions with the powerful Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir leader Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan, and the then Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lieutenant-General Ehsan-ul-Haq. He is believed to have told both men that the Hurriyat intended to open the way for a direct dialogue with New Delhi. “If the (Indian) government is not ready to allow self-determination,” Abdul said soon after the meeting, “the alternative is that it should be ready to settle the dispute through a meaningful dialogue involving all parties concerned.” But days after he made that declaration, the elder Lone was assassinated by a Lashkar-e-Taiba hit squad: a blunt message from the ISI that it wasn’t quite prepared to let go of its puppet strings. The assassination terrified the Hurriyat leadership. In 2004, Hurriyat leaders led by Mirwaiz Farooq met then Union home minister LK Advani, but their talks were purely surface-level. Then prime minister Manmohan Singh held a fresh round of negotiations with the Hurriyat in 2005, but its leaders never delivered on the promises to come back with detailed proposals. Former Union home minister P Chidambaram also secretly met with Hurriyat leaders. Finally, in March 2006, APHC leaders promised mediators they would attend Manmohan’s second round table conference on Jammu and Kashmir, but backed off after threats from the Hizbul. Lone's decision to break ranks with the secessionists in 2008 rested on two fundamental assumptions. First, the fracturing of the 2008 anti-India mass mobilisation—and the successful elections held in 2009—demonstrated that the secessionist constituency was waning. There was, secondly, no sign that India and Pakistan were going to cut a deal that would give the Hurriyat power. This meant power was going to have to be won through the only means available: elections. Lone stayed away from Kashmir politics after the early 1990s. His father’s People's Conference had long played a role in Opposition politics, but the long jihad which began in 1989 dealt him out of the game. For a while, Lone worked at a gold jewellery export business in Delhi: a business which collapsed amidst litigation over alleged misappropriation from the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. Later, he moved to Dubai to set up a business with a Pakistani national. He married Asma Lone, the son of one-time terrorist Amanullah Khan in 2000; it is improbable the two would have moved home to Srinagar were it not for the assassination. Lone inherited his father’s party at a time when New Delhi turned away from the Hurriyat, and sought to cut a deal with Pakistan. In secret meetings which began in 2005, Manmohan's envoy SK Lambah, and his Pakistani counterpart Tariq Aziz, arrived at five points of convergence. The agreements were drafted on unsigned notes, and contain the contours of a final India-Pakistan agreement on Kashmir. First, the two men agreed, there would be no redrawing of the Line of Control. Second, they accepted that there would have to be greater political autonomy on both sides of Jammu and Kashmir. Lambah and Aziz also agreed that India would begin troops cuts in response to deescalation of jihadist violence, cooperatively manage resources like watersheds and glaciers and, finally, open the Line of Control. “I think the agenda is pretty much set,” Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told an interviewer in April 2007. “It is September, 2007,” he went on, “that India and Pakistan are looking at, in terms of announcing something on Kashmir”. But General Musharraf was swept out of power: and Lone finally lost hope of a deal involving Pakistan. Butt now called on the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party to work with the secessionist formation to “mutually work out a joint settlement and present it to India and Pakistan.” For his part, Lone called for secessionist aspirations to focus on the “achievable”. “In between ‘everything’ and ‘nothing’,” Lone said, “the leadership has to consider ‘something’ as well”. Put simply, he realised he’d missed the bus—and was scrambling to get the journey going again. “Something” is exactly what Lone got: two Members of the Legislative Assembly were elected in 2014, including himself. The wins were significant not for their scale, but because it marked the first transition of secessionists back into the political system. Key Hurriyat leaders, including Syed Ali Shah Geelani, fought and won elections prior to the long jihad; the hope was that figures like Lone marked a reversal of the tide. Lone himself showed signs that he regretted not having fought the 2009 Assembly elections: ““People voted at the wrong time,” Lone ruefully said at a press conference in December, “but we cannot pretend nothing has happened”. The People’s Conference leader’s bid to form a government in Kashmir is consistent with his strategy since his election run. Having persuaded himself that Pakistan will be able to give Kashmir’s secessionists nothing, cultivating a close relationship with whomsoever holds power in New Delhi offers the best chance of acquiring power. In the process, Lone is running several risks. For one, the BJP is seen, by substantial numbers numbers of ethnic Kashmiris, as an agent of a predatory Hindu State: determined to steal both their land and religious identity. Perhaps more important, the political tide has changed since 2009. Then, the secessionist movement collapsed; now, it has been reborn, spearheaded by a new generation of young Islamists. There is a flip side to that reality, though: The disarray in the ranks of the PDP and National Conference, both besieged by Islamists in their traditional strongholds, offers Lone  an historic opportunity to expand his constituency. He hopes to emerge as the leader of a new cohort of politicians emerging out of the debris of the collapsed political system. Lone would, perhaps, call this ambition; others might see it as hubris. He’s learnt the hard way, though, that political opportunities do not wait at the roadside to pick up passengers.",2018-11-23,"BJP,Congress,Governor,InMyOpinion,Jammu And Kashmir,NC,PDP,Sajad Gani Lone,Sajad Lone,Sarkaria Commission,Satya Pal Malik",Sajad Lone's bid to form Jammu and Kashmir govt shows he's learnt the hard way that political opportunity doesn't wait to knock,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sajad-lones-bid-to-form-jammu-and-kashmir-govt-shows-hes-learnt-the-hard-way-that-political-opportunity-doesnt-wait-to-knock-5600531.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rajendra Sharma," Alwar district in Rajasthan seems to be slipping away from the BJP, which had won 10 of the 11 seats in last Assembly election. The polarisation of the SC/STs and Muslims against the BJP is expected to erode the party's numbers considerably on 7 December when the state goes to polls. The Meo Muslims haven't forgotten the the mob lynchings, which took the lives of Pehlu Khan, Umar Khan and, Rakbar Khan, or the continuing harassment that they faced at the hands of self-styled  s. That the state government failed to take action against these perpetrators, further deteriorated the Vasundhara Raje government's image. As for SC/STs in Alwar, the ruling party's attempt to amend the SC/ST Atrocities Act didn't bode well with the community. The death of Dalit youth Pawan Kumar Jatav in police firing during the Bharat Bandh of 2 April earlier this year, and the heavy-handed police action against protesters when angry mobs burnt police vehicles and attacked several police stations — Over 3,000 FIRs were filed against protesters in Khairthal, a small town in Alwar district — rankles deeply in the community. “The cow issue has created a wall between the Hindu and Muslim communities,” said Pappu Khan, a Meo Muslim who resides in Nasopur, Ramgarh. He adds, ""The Meo community nurtures cows in a large number and are scared of going into the fields with their cows for fear of being mistaken as cow slaughterers."" Hakamuddin, a resident of Chandpur, echoes similar sentiment. “A rift has been created between Hindus and Muslims in Alwar due to several mob lynching cases,” he says, adding, ""People in the region are now looking at the Congress for support."" There is also a growing feeling among the Meo Muslims that the BJP does not consider the community as its vote bank despite being the largest voters group in Ramgarh Assembly constituencies. ""The BJP has not done anything for us in the last five years,” said Khan. Dalits and Meos together comprise 7.5 lakh voters in Alwar district. The number goes up to 9 lakhs if other SC/ST communities are included. Support from these communities is crucial to any party’s electoral performance in this region. The overall caste distribution of the population in Alwar is 4.5 lakh SCs, 3.6 lakh Yadavs, three lakh Brahmins, 3.5 lakh Meos, 2.1 lakh Jats, 2 lakh Meenas, 1.7 lakh Vaishyas, 1.3 lakh Malis, one lakh Sikh-Punjabis and Gujjars each, 60,000 Rajputs, and 1.5 lakh other voters, according to sources. Besides Ramgarh, Dalits and Meo communities form major vote bank in Alwar Rural, Kishangarh Bas and Tijara constituencies. Dalits remain angry with the BJP in all these constituencies. “The BJP had conspired to suppress the community,” said Rattiyam, a villager belonging to the SC community. “FIRs were lodged against people from SC/ST communities and they are being tortured. BJP had assured to take back the cases but nothing has been done,” he added. Jitendra Singh, former minister of state, who also represented Alwar Lok Sabha constituency as a Congress MP, says the BJP works towards dividing the public in the name of caste and religion. ""This is why the party has made efforts towards creating tussles among communities, and thereby, spoiling the harmonious relationship. BJP has not done anything for the development of the region and Congress promises to stand by the residents of Alwar during all situations."" The BJP is aware that it's facing a double blow of anti-incumbency and non-performance of sitting MLAs in the district. ""Some resentment is always there and we are trying to address this,” said BJP district president Sanjay Naruka. “We want to include everyone and I am sure people will realise this and vote for us,"" he adds. The BJP's candidate list indicate that the party is looking for alternatives to current leaders as a repair measure. Two key BJP Hindutva leaders and sitting MLAs, Gyan Dev Ahuja and Banwari Lal Singhal, both known to spread antipathy against the Meo community, have been denied tickets, probably to tone down the Hindutva stance. “If the party has denied me a ticket because of the voice I have raised to protect Hindutva, then I must tell the party that I will keep fighting for the interests of Hindus,” says Singhal. “I respect the party’s decision to not give me a ticket,” he adds. Gyan Dev Ahuja, however, resigned from the party and is not contesting in this election.",2018-11-23,"Alwar,Alwar Rural,BJP,Caste,Congress,Cow Politics,Dalit,Dilution Of SC/ST Act,Gau-Rakshak,Kishangarh Bas,Lynchings,Meo Muslims,Polarisation,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Ramgarh,SC/ST Atrocities Act,Tijara","Rajasthan Assembly polls: Alwar may slip out of BJP's grip as lynchings, subjugation of SC/STs polarise voters",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-assembly-polls-alwar-may-slip-out-of-bjps-grip-as-lynchings-subjugation-of-scsts-polarise-voters-5601921.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"Moments after Congress president Rahul Gandhi publicly deplored CP Joshi's casteist comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former Union minister issued an unconditional apology to ""any section of the society"" he may have hurt. Rahul took a stand against abusive comments of his party colleague stating that former Union minister's statement stood against the party's ideology. ""While respecting the principles of Congress, the spirit of the workers, Joshi must surely realize the mistake,"" said Rahul. Joshi had stirred up a controversy on Thursday when he claimed that only Pandits, intellectuals and Brahmins were qualified to speak on Hinduism.

There is a weird trend in the country where people from different castes are speaking on Hinduism. Uma Bharti, who belongs to the Lodi samaj, is talking about Hindu religion. Sadhvi ji also belongs to a different religion and is talking about Hindu religion. Narendra Modi too belongs to some other religion and talks about Hinduism. In the last 50 years, Brahmins have lost their mind,"" said CP Joshi. ""Does anyone know what is the caste of Uma Bharti? What is the caste of Sadhvi Ritambhara?

""It is a matter between two constituents of the alliance -- BJP and MGP. So we are not concerned with it,"" Sardesai said. ""As far as MGP is concerned, its decision to go to the court is surprising....I can believe it is a preemptive move, they (MGP) have not lost anything, Congress has lost two MLAs,"" Sardesai said in a cryptic remark.

In an article titled, ' )', which was published in the  Sena accused its ally of putting unnecessary terms and conditions on party chief   when the BJP does its religious pitch — be it in ""Nepal or in Varanasi"" — without any fuss. The article noted that the BJP should stop raising questions about the Sena's intentions, and accused the BJP of conspiring against its ally. The Sena claimed that the party is not travelling to Ayodhya from Maharashtra and the rest of the country for politics. ""Begging for votes in the name of Ram and chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' just as election season rolls around — such tricks are not in our blood."" The party also claimed that it is not sloganeering ' ', but has called everyone to the city for Ram darshan. ""We are going to Ayodhya with the same reverence with which Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to Nepal's Pashupatinath temple, and Varanasi's Ganga aarti,"" it said. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in October had announced, during the Shiv Sena's Vijayadashmi rally, that he will visit Ayodhya on 25 November and ""question"" Modi on the construction of the Ram temple.

FP Staff,"After former Union minister  , it is Uttar Pradesh Congress' chief Raj Babbar who launched a scathing personal attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. In a statement that is likely to blow up a political storm, Babbar has reportedly called the prime minister  (ominous) over the rising fuel prices. The Congress leader did not stop there. He launched a personal attack against Modi by comparing the devalued rate of the Indian rupee to the prime minister’s nonagenarian mother. ""He (Modi) used to say that the Indian rupee has fallen so much against the dollar that it was nearing the age of the then prime minister (Manmohan Singh). Today, the rupee’s valuation has dropped so low, that it is inching closer to your beloved mother’s age,""  , who was campaigning in Madhya Pradesh, said. BJP leader Anila Singh reacted to these comments strongly and said that the Congress was steadily decreasing its level of politics. ""Congress has become a party of loonies, I can see that. We are all in the electoral fray to compete against each other. But at least spare the family members.   (the prime minister's mother is not in politics), she told Meanwhile, Congress' Akhilesh Pratap Singh defended Babbar's comment with the argument that even Modi hits out at the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty in his speeches frequently. Defending the usage of the word  Singh said that the prime minister had himself thanked his good fortune for reducing crude oil prices towards the beginning of his term. He argued that then what was the harm in calling him inauspicious when now the prices were skyrocketing. At an election rally in New Delhi  , Modi had said, ""Ok, let's accept that I am lucky but you have saved money. If Modi's luck is benefitting the people, what can be more fortunate? If due to my good luck, prices of petrol and diesel come down and common man saves more, then what is the need to bring someone who is unlucky?"" Earlier on Thursday, Joshi launched a casteist attack on the prime minister claiming that only Pandits, intellectuals and Brahmins are qualified to speak on Hinduism. Joshi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister Uma Bharti and questioned their authority over the subject. ""If anyone is qualified to speak on religion it is the Pandits, the intellectuals and the Brahmins. There is a weird trend in the country where people from different castes are speaking on Hinduism. Uma Bharti, who belongs to the Lodhi samaj, is talking about Hindu religion. Sadhvi ji also belongs to a different religion and is talking about Hindu religion. Narendra Modi too belongs to some other religion and talks about Hinduism. In the last 50 years, Brahmins have lost their mind,"" said Joshi. Joshi's comment comes soon after he claimed that only a Congress prime minister would be able to build the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. In fact, Babbar also reiterated Joshi's stand on Ram Temple, claiming that his party was never opposed to the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and he now felt that even the Muslim community wanted it. He, however, added that the construction should wait as the case is still pending in the Supreme Court. These statement seem to be an   from the party's carefully held position—at least in recent times—that it would welcomes the Supreme Court's verdict on the issue.

Suhit K Sen,"Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya Pal Malik played willing marionette to the two puppeteers who, between them, aspire to run an Opposition-  Bharat — to use the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) infelicitous but revealing terminology — and dissolved the state Assembly within hours of three parties coming together to stake acclaim to form a fresh government. Since the BJP-Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  , the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly kept in suspended animation and Governor's Rule imposed in the state, Malik was not bound by the convention of recommending the dissolution of the Assembly on the advice of the chief minister and state cabinet because neither existed. He took a hurried call on the orders of Delhi — in other words, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The dissolution deprived the PDP the opportunity to form a government in Jammu and Kashmir again. Before dissolving the House, the governor had   from PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who had been the chief minister before alliance partner BJP withdrew support. Malik had also refused to take calls from her, forcing the PDP leader to tweet the letter. Important political and constitutional issues lie at the heart of Malik's move. Legally and constitutionally, Malik can say he was well within his rights to dissolve the Assembly. But what Malik and his Delhi minders perpetrated was what is called in legalese as either a ""fraud on power"" or the ""illegal use of power"". Essentially, this means that legitimately available power was exercised, but it was done in the pursuit of illegitimate goals. If the governor had thought that the state's constitutional machinery had broken down, he should have sent a report to the Centre recommending the dissolution of the House. That is the normal procedure. Even when a state is to be brought under Governor's Rule illegitimately — as in the extant case — the Centre usually waits for the governor to send a rigged report. In this case, no report was sought, or, it appears, submitted in writing. However, the point is that if Malik had wanted the Assembly dissolved, he should have made the recommendation in August, after taking over the gubernatorial reins., or his predecessor NN Vohra should have done so. In fact, enough people had demanded the dissolution of the Assembly, including National Conference leader Omar Abdullah. The timing of the dissolution makes it clear that Malik moved under orders — willingly or otherwise — to forestall the formation of a government that would prove inimical to the BJP's calculations. By dissolving the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Malik ignored admittedly dodgy precedents set elsewhere by his BJP masters. Take Bihar. In 2015, an alliance of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United) and Congress had swept the state elections and formed a coalition government. In July 2017, barely two years later, in a move clearly orchestrated by outgoing and incoming chief minister Nitish Kumar and BJP leaders, Nitish disbanded the ""grand alliance"" by resigning as chief minister and was sworn in hours later in the same position, but with the BJP as his new ally. No gubernatorial compunctions seemed to have been experienced in showing the green light to this utterly unprincipled manoeuvre — a blatant betrayal of the 2015 mandate. Let's take Goa and Manipur next. In Goa, the Congress won 17 of the 40 Assembly seats and the BJP, 13. The BJP got nine legislators on its side — three each from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Goa Forward Party and three independents. Armed with a list of 22, it was invited to form a government, which it duly did. No reservations were expressed about this opportunist post-poll alliance. In Manipur, the Congress had won 28 seats out of 60, while the BJP had bagged 21. The Congress' outgoing chief minister, Ibobi Singh, had staked claim to form a government as the leader of the party that had won the largest number of seats. His claim was ignored, and the BJP was given time to initiate its practiced politics of manipulation. Ultimately, the BJP formed a government in Manipur with the support of the National People's Party (four MLAs), Lok Janshakti Party and Trinamool Congress (one each), a Congress MLA, who strangely enough did not invite the provisions of the anti-defection law, and independents. BJP governor Najma Heptullah did not seem to be worried about the fragility or stability of this coalition of convenience. Now take Jammu and Kashmir, as a matter fact. When the PDP and BJP decided to form a coalition government, no questions were raised by the governor about this decidedly surreal alliance. If you really stretch yourself, you can find some common ground between the PDP and National Conference — they are both Kashmiri parties; both are committed to some notion of Kashmiri exceptionalism and autonomy; and both are wary of the BJP's Jammu-based Hindutva agenda, sharing, as they do, the same kind of social constituencies. Also, the PDP and Congress have been allies in the past. But by what stretch of imagination did the then governor of Jammu and Kashmir decide that the PDP and BJP, who are ideologically and programmatically on absolutely opposite ends of the spectrum, could form a ""stable"" government? The imagination boggles. Now, the BJP, in its avatar of the central government, and its man in Srinagar are voicing concerns about the stability of an alliance between the PDP, National Conference and Congress. One newspaper has reported that the central government views this coalition as detrimental to the political situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Of course it does. But not because the ""arrangement"" would be riven by ""contradictions"". The BJP and the central government are concerned because the new arrangement would have shut the BJP out and brought an end to its ongoing   as a cat's paw to induce PDP legislators into his party and form a government with BJP support. In the process, the BJP has continued with its serial subversion of institutions. From the governor's post — an unnecessary colonial residue inserted into the polity under the Government of India Act, 1935 — to police-elected provincial governments have been politicised for some time now. Indira Gandhi most famously used it to unseat state dispensations she did not favour — the unseating of the Charan Singh government in 1970, despite the chief minister having the support of the Jana Sangh, the Congress (O) and the Sangathana Socialist Party, may have been a straw in the wind then. But after returning to power in 1980, she cynically manipulated constitutional provisions to unseat several governments. The BJP's manoeuvre bears all the fingerprints of Indira's style of functioning. What will transpire now is not yet clear. Someone or the other could move court against the dismissal of the Assembly, which would make logical sense. The Congress and National Conference may be content to wait things out for another six months, by when state elections will have to be held. But allowing the BJP to hold the reins for six months through Malik should be a sobering thought. In a general sense, the Jammu and Kashmir situation, once again, proves one thing though — that the more the BJP becomes like the unreconstructed Indira Congress, especially of 1980s vintage, the shriller its absurd spokespersons become in their denunciations of the Congress and its historical legacy, never mind the fact that the present-day Congress has shed a lot of that baggage.",2018-11-22,"Congress,Congress-NC-PDP Alliance,Governor,J&K,J&K Assembly Dissolved,J&K Governor,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly Dissolved,Jammu And Kashmir Governor,Kashmir Politics,Malik,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,Omar Abdullah,PDP,PoliticsDecoder,Satya Pal Malik",J&K Assembly dissolution: Satya Pal Malik played willing hand in BJP's game to subvert institutions,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-governor-satya-pal-malik-has-played-willing-puppet-in-dissolving-assembly-continued-bjp-tradition-of-subverting-institutions-5596241.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Editors,"In a surprising development, Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik dissolved the state Assembly on Wednesday night. The governor's decision followed the staking of claims by rival coalitions — Sajjad Lone of the People’s Conference aligning with the BJP and PDP rebels on one hand, and Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP forming a grand coalition with the National Conference and Congress on the other. The attempts to form a coalition had gathered steam in the past few days, as the six month validity of Governor's Rule was coming to an end. In the event of inability to form a government, Governor's Rule would have given way to the promulgation of President's Rule. The governor's decision to dissolve the state Assembly reflects the enduring political uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir. This is particularly true for the Kashmir Valley, where rival mainstream political parties — the Congress, NC and PDP continue to grapple with the BJP’s determined push in the region, against all odds. The reason for the BJP's persistence is the willingness of some of the political leaders in the Valley, who have no particular aversion to the BJP, and who ultimately desire political power at any cost. After the breakup of the BJP-PDP alliance in June this year, it was an open secret that the BJP's central leadership was trying to cobble up another coalition in the state with Lone and some 'willing' rebels within the PDP. While Lone was a ready candidate to become the chief minister, the BJP found it difficult to make the 'willing' rebels split the PDP wide open. The BJP’s central leadership thought that with many of the candidates (whom it backed) winning urban municipal body seats in various parts of the Valley, that victory would decisively turn the tide for the party. And events of the past few days suggested that the BJP's dream of forming another government was going to fructify soon. Power always trumps politics, but the ongoing political machinations in the Kashmir Valley bear out this axiom even more vividly. What threw the spanner in the BJP's works was the extraordinary compromise or the political opportunism — depending on which side you are on — that was demonstrated by the regional rivals – PDP and NC — with the blessings of the Congress. Till a few days ago, such a compromise would have been unimaginable, and unviable, if you believe BJP-backed sources. In the emerging political scenario, both the PDP and National Conference sensed a political opportunity to decisively shut the BJP out of the Valley. The potential arrangement would have worked in every party's favour. The PDP would have been able to wash its hands off the 'unpardonable' sin of holding Kashmir's doors open for the BJP in the first place, and regain its lost credibility. The National Conference would have further burnished its claim of being the only pole of power capable of taking on the BJP in the Valley. More importantly, both the PDP and National Conference would have been able to thwart the efforts to prop up a third regional political force in the Valley. Meanwhile, the Congress would have found another opportunity to cock a snook at the BJP's political game plan of 'Congress-  Bharat'. The fact that the PDP-Congress-National Conference grand alliance seemed to secure the necessary numbers, including some from the 'willing' rebels of the PDP whom the BJP was wooing, once again shows that BJP’s central leadership continues to underestimate or miscalculate the Valley's aversion to its right-wing agenda. It is important to note that even after close to five years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi proactively wooing Kashmiris, the statesman the state still recalls warmly is the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was Vajpayee, who chose hope over fear, principles over power, compromise over confrontation and empathy over harshness. Modi's approach, often confined to binaries — such as tourism not terrorism, and youths should have laptops not stones in their hands — meanwhile only evoked ridicule and pessimism among Kashmiris. This embarrassment will hopefully provide some lessons to the party's central leadership that was presented four-and-a-half years ago with a golden opportunity to restore normalcy to Jammu and Kashmir and substantially improve India's national security outlook. Instead it chose politics as its strategy to deal with Kashmir and today the results are evident. The Kashmir of 2018 is a faint reflection of the Kashmir of 2014, rather a strong mirror image of Kashmir of 1989. The BJP has already faced a setback in another region of the state that often claims to have been ignored by the Kashmir-dominated state politics. In Ladakh, the BJP's only MP Thupstan Chhewang resigned recently, days after the party failed to open its account in the Leh and Kargil municipal bodies. Clearly, a lot needs to be done now for the party to reclaim its lost ground in Jammu and Kashmir.",2018-11-22,"BJP,Congress,InMyOpinion,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly Dissolved,Kashmir Valley,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,PDP,Sajjad Lone","Jammu and Kashmir Assembly dissolved: BJP faces massive task to reclaim lost ground, credibility in state",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-assembly-dissolved-bjp-faces-massive-task-to-reclaim-lost-ground-credibility-in-state-5596771.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Editors,"The political atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir was charged up soon after   after both the PDP-National Conference-Congress combine and the People's Conference-led alliance approached him to stake a claim to form the government. On 20 June, former Jammu and Kashmir governor NN Vohra had already placed the Assembly under suspended animation after the imposition of Governor's Rule in the state. On Wednesday, Malik dissolved the Assembly with immediate effect, taking four main factors into consideration, including ""extensive horse-trading"" and the ""impossibility"" of a coalition of parties with ""opposing political ideologies"" forming a stable government, the  . When a House is in suspended animation, the MLAs continue to be members of the Assembly, but the governor cannot prorogue a session. As a result, the Assembly cannot pass any law, and if the need for the same arises, Parliament steps in. The ministers continue to be in office but practically without any ministerial work. In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the Mehbooba Mufti cabinet had resigned, as a result of which the state had no ministers after the BJP-PDP alliance fell apart. Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir empowers the state governor to ""make such incidental and consequential provisions as appear to the governor to be necessary or desirable for giving effect to the objects of the proclamation, including provisions for suspending in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to any body or authority in the state"". The law also says that ""nothing in this section shall authorise the governor to assume to himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the high court or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to the high court"", thus bringing the governor's decision under the purview of judicial review. This is akin to Article 356(C) of the Constitution of India. In case of the failure of constitutional machinery in the state,   gives the President of India the authority to ""make such incidental and consequential provisions"" that appear to be ""necessary or desirable"", including ""provisions for suspending in whole or in part the operation of any provisions of this Constitution relating to anybody or authority in the state, provided that nothing in this clause shall authorise the president to assume to himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by a high court, or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to high courts"". A few years ago, a similar political imbroglio arose in Delhi, when voters gave a fractured mandate in May 2016.   constitutional experts had then said that the Lieutenant Governor had ""the choice of recommending the suspended animation of the Assembly only if he feels there is a possibility of government formation in the near future"". Constitutional expert PDT Acharya had then said that the House would have to be dissolved ""if the BJP or the AAP does not come forward to form a government and prove its majority in the Assembly"". Article 356 also says: ""The Proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiration of 30 days from the date on which the House of the People first sits after its reconstitution, unless before the expiration of the said period of 30 days, a resolution approving the Proclamation has been also passed by the House of the People."" The problem in Jammu and Kashmir is that the governor did not allow the alliance that claimed to have the numerical strength of more than 44 MLAs — the required strength in the Assembly to form the government — and prove its majority in the House, as is mandated by law. , the then president KR Narayanan had refused to endorse the recommendation of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet  to dismiss the Bihar government under Rabri Devi and place the Assembly under suspended animation. Narayanan reportedly cited ""the fact that the Rabri government had just won a post-walkout 190-0 trust vote in the 321-strong state Assembly, and thus invalidated a case of constitutional breakdown"". Governor Malik, with his sudden act of dissolving the Jammu and Kashmir legislature, has exposed himself to judicial scrutiny. While overturning former Arunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa's decision to prepone the Assembly session, the Supreme Court, on 13 July, 2016, while referring to provisions under Article 163, had said: ""Such exercise of independent judgment can only be questioned by way of judicial review."" The ""independent judgment"" it was referring to was of the state governor in this case. PDP chief and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, soon after her government collapsed in June, had sought fresh polls and requested the dissolution of the Assembly, but this finally happened only after she sought to offer her support to a PDP alliance with the Congress and National Conference willing to form the government. It isn't clear whether Malik, a former BJP member, has risked his days at the Raj Bhawan to favour his earlier party, but the brazenness of his action gives this very impression, which is not in consonance with the propriety of a gubernatorial office.",2018-11-22,"BJP,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Governor,J&K Assembly Dissolved,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly,Jammu And Kashmir Governor,Kashmir Governor,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,PDP,Politics,Satya Pal Malik",Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik has walked into legal minefield by dissolving Assembly already in suspended animation,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-governor-satya-pal-malik-has-walked-into-legal-minefield-by-dissolving-assembly-already-in-suspended-animation-5595701.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"What came as a bizarre political development in Jammu and Kashmir, when official communique were sent and shared over social media — Twitter and WhatsApp to be specific — turned even more outlandish when Governor Satya Pal Malik said that since there was ""absence of staff"" due to Eid holidays, he missed Mehbooba Mufti's letter staking claim to form the government. Malik said that he would not allow a government to be formed on defections. The governor also said that he dissolved the Assembly for the interest of the state and it was in keeping with the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Let's do a quick recap of how things unfolded since Wednesday evening: The dramatic situation of an out-of-order fax machine at the Governor's office and governments being formed on social media, sent Twitterati into a tizzy. What was curious was Malik's instant order dissolving the state Assembly soon after complaints of a faulty fax machine went viral. Even Mehbooba in her tweets noted that even though the fax machine was out of order, it did not take too long for the Governor to send an order on dissolving the state Assembly.  In his defence, Malik said that his office was shut because of Eid so he got ""no communication from Mehbooba"". ""She could have approached me any other day...On a holiday no one was sitting next to fax machine,"" he said. He further added that there was no one even to ""give me food"". We think that's when everyone was ready to call the Governor's bluff. Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and National Conference chief Omar Abdullah, while taking a jibe at Malik's claim that he missed Mehbooba's correspondence because his fax machine was not working, said that many things had killed democracy in Jammu and Kashmir, but this was a first when a fax machine did the job. He said that Malik apparently had a one-way fax machine which could send the governor's recommendation to Delhi, but failed to receive Mehbooba's letter. He, however, added that now NC does not even have any option but to look for light humour in the situation. ""But this is in no way a matter that can be laughed off,"" he said on Thursday. Omar also expressed surprise over the governor's decision to dissolve the Assembly minutes after the letters were sent to him. ""(JK)NC has been pressing for assembly dissolution for months now. It can’t be a coincidence that within minutes of Mehbooba Mufti sahiba letter staking claim the order to dissolve the assembly suddenly appears,"" Abdullah tweeted on Wednesday. Further, reacting sarcastically to the situation, Abdullah share a GIF on Twitter of a fax machine receiving a document and subsequently throwing it into a shredder. He then shared a meme to mock the Governor's silence on the political developments, until he finally decided to dissolve the Assembly. Reporters from Jammu and Kashmir, who are familiar with the functioning of the Raj Bhawan, said that the staff are predominantly Hindu and don't usually take holidays on Eid. Even if that wasn't the case, it is a difficult to believe that the first citizen of the state was left without any staff and was forced to feed himself and run basic errands such as collecting a fax from his office. But Malik mentioned that even if he had got the fax, his ""decision would have been the same"" since ""he had decided not to allow any government on the basis of ""defections or loose arrangements"".",2018-11-22,"BJP,Jammu,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Assembly,Jammu And Kashmir Governor,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,NC,Omar Abdullah,PDP,Raj Bhavan,Sajjad Ghani Lone,Satya Pal Malik,Shareworthy","'Fax pas' in Jammu and Kashmir: As parties form govt on Twitter, WhatsApp, Satya Pal Malik's 'faulty fax machine' defence is frail",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/fax-pas-in-jammu-and-kashmir-as-parties-form-govt-on-twitter-whatsapp-satya-pal-maliks-faulty-fax-machine-defence-is-frail-5595751.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"The Union Cabinet on Thursday   the construction and development of the Kartarpur Corridor from the Dera Baba Nanak gurdwara in Punjab's Gurdaspur district to the India-Pakistan border, two months after the ruling BJP had attacked Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu for announcing that Pakistan had decided to allow Sikh pilgrims direct access to the gurdwara, clubbing it with its criticism of the Punjab minister for hugging the Pakistan Chief of Army. The decision was made at a meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in view of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019. New Delhi said it will request Islamabad to recognise the sentiments of the Sikh community and develop a corridor with suitable facilities in their territory, as well, as the corridor will facilitate the movement of Sikh pilgrims visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur on the banks of the Ravi river in Pakistan. The corridor had made headlines in August after Sidhu visited Pakistan to attend Prime Minister Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony. During his visit, Sidhu had   Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and claimed to have done so because Bajwa had told him Pakistan may open a corridor to the Kartarpur Sahib shrine. Sidhu's visit to Pakistan had caused a huge outcry among rival parties and garnered criticism not only for the hug, but also for the fact that he had attended Imran's ceremony when others from India had declined the invitation. Former Indian cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, whom Imran had invited to his oath-taking event, had given it a miss. The   had used the opportunity to attack Sidhu, asking Congress president Rahul Gandhi whether the Punjab minister had his permission to attend Imran's event and whether he would suspend him immediately for his remarks. While a majority of the criticism was directed at him hugging the Pakistan Army Chief of Staff, he was also accused of politicising the subject of the route to the Kartarpur shrine, which is of great religious significance for Sikhs. After his trip to Islamabad, Sidhu had claimed that he had taken the first step towards peace. He had also written to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to take up the subject of the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh pilgrims from Punjab. Reports said that Swaraj had, in fact,   and told him that his behaviour in Pakistan went beyond the purpose of the visit. Swaraj is also believed to have said the Kartarpur Corridor matter should not be politicised as it was a sensitive one.

However, he  the Cabinet's decision on Thursday, making no mention of Sidhu. ""It's a historic day for the entire Sikh community, and we would like to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Cabinet. This has been a wish of each and every Sikh,"" he said. Furthermore, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had earlier flayed Sidhu for ""lying"" on issues related to the Sikh faith, claiming that his actions were aimed at furthering his political agenda. While Sidhu had claimed that the Pakistani government was waiting for an official request from India to open the route, Badal said Sidhu had deliberately made it appear as though Islamabad was all ready to let in Punjabi pilgrims, and that the delay was from New Delhi's side.

FP Staff,": Ram Madhav took back his remarks on asking Omar Abdullah to prove his allegation that the National Conference boycotted the local polls in Jammu and Kashmir at Pakistan's behest, after the two leaders clashed on Twitter, a day after Governor Satya Pal Malik dissolved the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly. Earlier Omar Abdullah had asked the BJP leader to apologise for his remarks. The surprise move came hours after the PDP staked claim to form a government with the backing of rival NC and the Congress, followed by another bid from the two-member People's Conference which claimed the support of the BJP and 18 legislators from other parties. Madhav reportedly alleged that the PDP and the NC boycotted local body polls last month because they had instructions from across the border. Fresh instructions were given to both parties from across the border to come together and form government in Jammu and Kashmir, he was quoted as saying. Countering Madhav's allegation, Abdullah said he dared the BJP's pointsman for the state to prove his allegation. ""You have RAW, NIA & IB at your command (CBI too is your parrot) so have the guts to place evidence in the public domain. Either prove this or be man enough to apologise.

Sreemoy Talukdar,"The BJP has walked into a trap in Jammu and Kashmir. It is fair to say that troika of PDP, NC and Congress has not only succeeded in upsetting BJP’s calculations, it has also notched up a tactical win over BJP by forcing the governor to dissolve the Assembly — an outcome that both the NC and PDP were looking for and the BJP wanted to avoid. To understand why the state’s key players acted in the way they did let’s rewind to 19 June this year when the BJP pulled out of the ruling coalition with the PDP, withdrew support to the Mehbooba Mufti government and the chief minister had to step down. Since then, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly has been kept in a state of suspended animation. This suited the BJP for reasons more than one. It was clear to the party’s top leadership that its alliance with the PDP wasn’t working. What’s more, it had generated enough toxins to harm the saffron outfit’s Hindu base in Jammu and had allowed the Congress to eat into its political capital. But preventing an erosion of its base wasn’t the only reason that motivated the BJP. It had a much larger aim. The BJP had been trying to break the duopoly of PDP and NC in Valley and engineer an alternative to the two mainstream political parties by propping up a third force in the form of Peoples Conference, whose leader Sajad Lone seems to have gained BJP’s trust. PC has just two MLAs, but BJP’s calculation was incumbent on an assumption that it may be able to manoeuvre a split within the PDP by encouraging some disgruntled PDP MLAs to walk out and join Lone and rewrite the script of Jammu and Kashmir politics. It obviously helped BJP’s cause to keep the Assembly suspended, not dissolved, as it stepped up efforts to factionalise the PDP. This process had begun in right earnest from the moment Mufti had had to step down. Two weeks after the BJP-PDP breakup,   that PDP — which has 28 MLAs — is headed towards a “vertical split” with former minister and north Kashmir MLA Imran Raza Ansari leading the faction against Mufti’s dynastic rule. He claimed to have support from “many MLAs”. , the rebels were reportedly ready to form a government in Jammu and Kashmir with BJP’s help and Lone’s name was proposed as the chief minister.   issued a warning to BJP that “engineering a split” in her party will have “extremely dangerous consequences”.  that were held in October and boycotted by both PDP and NC, BJP won 53 out of 132 wards in south Kashmir and gained an unprecedented control over at least four of the 20 civic bodies in the four districts of Anantnag, Kulgam, Pulwama and Shopian.   in the Valley, but the polls were largely peaceful. The results were a huge setback to the NC and PDP. As  , “Despite the criticism on the credibility of the elections, the PDP and NC cannot ignore one stark truth: through the boycott of elections, they have ceded space to the BJP, its allies and the Congress party. Historically, the Congress party has had a considerable political foothold in the Kashmir, it is the gains made by the BJP and its ally Peoples’ Conference which is more worrying for the PDP and the NC.” It is in this backdrop that we must place the recent developments that were triggered the moment PDP heavyweight Muzaffar Hussain Baig hinted that he may join hands with PC chief Lone and stake claim to form the government in the state.  , as saying that he was “hurt and disillusioned” by the failure of the alliance (with the BJP) and Mufti’s decision to boycott the polls without consulting him when he was just a “phone call away”. Baig’s exit from the party he co-founded would be a crippling blow to Mufti. PDP’s vertical split, in that case, would be inevitable. His comments sparked a chain reaction that ended with Governor Satya Pal Malik dissolving the Assembly on Wednesday evening, moment after both Sajad Lone and Mufti had staked separate claims to form a government. While Lone claimed to have support from 18 ‘other lawmakers’ along with BJP’s 25, PDP cobbled up an ‘alliance’ with arch-rivals NC and Congress. It is difficult to dismiss the impression that Mufti’s claim — that was sent over Twitter since the fax machine at governor’s house was apparently “not working” — was less of an attempt to give Jammu and Kashmir a stable government and more of an effort to force a dissolution of the Assembly that serves her (and PDP’s) immediate political purpose. Having ceded ground to the BJP and PC in civic body polls, both mainstream regional outfits were in danger of submitting their duopoly over the Valley and falling into irrelevance with PDP facing the additional strain of an impending split. That this wasn’t a “serious” claim was further borne by the fact that Congress is still apparently iffy about joining the alliance.  , as saying that “no final decision has been taken” and the proposal is only at the stage of a “suggestion”. NC leader Omar Abdullah, too,   that “PDP had made a ‘grand alliance’ offer, but we turned it down.” The governor’s haste, though, raises a few larger questions. Few would buy Malik’s claim that he wasn’t acting under instructions from Delhi. His refusal to accept the purported fax from Mufti claiming that there was no one to receive it on a holiday while at the same time managing to send a fax ordering the dissolution of the Assembly is an act unbecoming of his office. The episode portrays the BJP as a party desperate to retain power and not averse to scheming for it. While being in power is the aim of every political party in a democracy, the BJP’s national footprint levies greater responsibility on the party than a wanton pursuit of power. It may or may not succeed in cobbling up a third front in Kashmir, but it has ended up causing a consolidation of power among Opposition, so much so that even arch-rivals are finding common grounds. This is a double-edged sword. A far better option for the BJP would have to let Mufti form a government backed by a shaky alliance and be ready to move in when that alliance collapses under the weight of its contradictions. Through the governor’s actions, it has now given Opposition a stick to beat it with during the Winter Session. Moreover, Malik’s assertion that he cannot allow “opposing political ideologies” to form an unstable government is strange, given the fact that ‘nationalist’ BJP had no qualms in forming a government with ‘soft-separatist’ PDP. Why wasn’t this objection raised in the past? We have not reached the last chapter of Jammu and Kashmir thriller but the lesson for BJP is clear. As the dominant force in national politics, at times it needs to play the waiting game instead of rushing in.",2018-11-22,"Congress,Ghulam Nabi Azad,Jammu And Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,PDP,People's Conference,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Sajad Lone,Satya Pal Malik","BJP won’t be too unhappy with developments in J&K, but Governor Satya Pal Malik has dented its moral halo",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-wont-be-too-unhappy-with-developments-in-jk-but-governor-satya-pal-malik-has-dented-its-moral-halo-5598551.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"NC leader Omar Abdullah Thursday asked Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik to make public reports about horse-trading in government formation in the state, saying people had a right to know who was buying legislators. His demand came after Malik, defending his decision to dissolve the state assembly, claimed ""extensive horse-trading"" was going on and it would have been impossible for parties with ""opposing political ideologies"" to form a stable government. On Wednesday, PDP with the support of the National Conference (NC) and the Congress staked claim for forming government, but their efforts were cut short as Malik decided to dissolve the assembly, which was in suspended animation since 19 June. ""If the governor has himself accepted that MLAs were being bought over, money was changing hands, people should know who was doing it. If the governor has such reports, he should make them public. ""These are not our accusations. It was the governor who said horse-trading was happening and money was changing hands. We want to know where did this money come from? We want to know at whose behest this money was being given and who was being bought?"" Abdullah told reporters. He said allegations of use of money and horse-trading cannot apply to the NC-PDP-Congress grand alliance, Malik is referring to another letter in which Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Gani Lone had staked claim for government formation. ""The governor said horse-trading and use of money for engineering defections had to be stopped. In our case, three parties (PDP, Congress and NC) came together. This accusation does not stand against us that money was used. ""Following our letter (PDP president Mehbooba Mufti's letter to governor), another letter was sent to the governor claiming support of 16 or 18 MLAs. The governor has said on this letter that this is horse-trading and money was changing hands. This cannot be ignored,"" he said without naming Lone. The Raj Bhawan had issued a statement Wednesday explaining why the governor had dissolved the assembly. The NC leader said, ""The governor gave reasons for not accepting the claim by the PDP. He said parties were different political ideologies were coming together. Did you ask this question in 2015 when the BJP and the PDP tied up? That time it was dubbed as coming together of north pole and south pole, you had no problems then."" ""Today, you are telling other parties that you cannot come together even though the difference on some important issues between PDP, NC and Congress are small compared to BJP and PDP,"" Abdullah said. He said as far as the NC is consider, power was never its aim and it had made clear that it does not want to be part of the government but lend outside support to safeguard Article 35A of the Constitution before the Supreme Court. ""We weren't going to be part of this government. We wanted that Article 35A be defended in the Supreme Court to protect the state's special status. We want to bring the state out of the present mess, knowing fully well that the NC would have suffered the most politically. But we kept party interests on the back burner in the state's larger interest,"" he said. On allegations by some BJP leaders that the alliance was formed at Pakistan's behest, Abdullah asked BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav to produce evidence or apologise. ""If you have the courage Ram Madhav, bring the proof of your accusation to the people's court. Let us see where you stand. Stop this politics of cowardice. ""We have seen a lot of people like you who indulge in shoot and scoot politics. You level baseless allegations and then lie low. You should either give proof of allegations or apologise,"" he said. BJP leaders are disrespecting the sacrifice of nearly 3,000 NC workers, who were killed for refusing to do Pakistan's bidding, the former chief minister said. ""I am sorry Madhav, you are disrespecting sacrifices of my 3,000 colleagues who refused to dance to the tunes of Pakistan. They died because they did not take instructions from across the border. ""More of my workers have died in these 30 years than your workers have ever died. You are asking us about sacrifices and what we have done for the country. What we have done we know it,"" he said. To a question on relevance of mainstream political parties in J-K when they could not form government even with the required numbers, he said the dissolution of the Assembly showed the relevance of such parties. ""Madhav is not unhappy over PDP, Congress and NC coming together. He is unhappy that his dream of forming government in the state remains unfulfilled. If any thing, that shows our relevance,"" Abdullah said. If his party would challenge the assembly's dissolution in court, he said the NC did not have a reason. ""We don't have any basis on which to challenge the governor's decision. The primary party that can challenge the decision is the party which had sent the letter (staking claim for government formation). The letter went from the PDP to the extent that the NC had verbally committed its support and we stand by that decision,"" he said. In a sarcastic remark over non-functioning of the Raj Bhawan's fax machine due to which Mehbooba's and Lone's letters could not be delivered to Malik, he said, ""This is the first time that a fax machine has scuttled democracy.""  ""Only outgoing fax, no incoming fax.

Press Trust of India," The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) kept the pot boiling on the Sabarimala issue on Wednesday with Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan lashing out at the Left government, saying its ""master plan"" was to ""harass"" pilgrims, as the Kerala High Court slammed the police for its alleged excesses on devotees. As the stand-off on the entry of women of menstrual age into the shrine continued, A Padmakumar, president of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) that manages the shrine, said their aim was to have a peaceful atmosphere in the temple and the TDB was prepared to hold talks with anyone in the matter. In the midst of the tense situation, there was no rush of devotees and the 18 holy steps, which normally sees a heavy crowd, wore a deserted look. Criticising the Inspector General of Police in-charge of Sabarimala and Superintendent of Police for the alleged action against pilgrims at Sabarimala and Nilackal recently, the court asked whether these officials had any criminal antecedents. The court also observed that experienced officials should be put in charge. A division bench, comprising Justices PR Ramachandra Menon and N Anil Kumar, directed the Pathanamthitta district magistrate to produce all files and records which led to the declaration of Section 144 banning assembly of four or more people in Sabarimala 'Sannidhanam' and surrounding areas. Hitting out at the CPM-led LDF government, Radhakrishnan said its ""master plan"" was to ""harass"" the devotees and not allow them to go to the Ayyappa temple. The union minister, who offered prayers at the hill shrine this evening carrying his   (holy bundle 
with offering to Lord Ayyappa) was displeased with the manner in which Superintendent of Police Yatish Chandra had behaved with him at Nilackal, a base camp. When the minister wanted to know why private vehicles of devotees were not being allowed to Pamba from Nilackal, while Kerala state transport corporation buses were plying, the officer explained that post floods the facilities at Pamba were meagre. The senior police officer explained to the Union minister about the features of Pamba, an environmentally fragile area. He also said if the Union minister gives him in writing to allow private vehicles to Pamba, he was prepared to allow all vehicles. ""He asked me whether I will take responsibility. Can the Superintendent of Police ask the same question to a state minister of Kerala? Will they allow him to ask this query?"" Radhakrishnan asked reporters after offering prayers. The minister declined to answer a question on the 28 September Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to offer worship at the shrine, saying ""I do not want to go into that...my concern is with devotees. Do not harass the devotees."" State BJP general secretary, AN Radhakrishnan, who was accompanying the minister, alleged that the IPS officer spoke ""arrogantly"" and ""misbehaved"" with the Union minister. He said that the matter would be brought to the Centre's notice. The Indian Police Service Association, Kerala chapter, on Wednesday night, had condemned the ""continued personal attacks and threats"" made against the IPS officers on duty at Sabarimala by certain individuals and organisations. ""We strongly denounce the attack on officers on religious and personal lines,"" it said, adding that the association was exploring possibilities of moving the Supreme Court in this regard. It also sought the intervention of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the matter. In a statement issued in Thiruvananthapuram, the association said comments purportedly made by the judiciary, as seen from media reports, personally on the officers' background, has also been highly demoralising for these officers who have been engaged following orders of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a court in Pathanamthitta district on Wednesday granted conditional bail to 72 people, including Kerala BJP general secretary K Surendran, who were arrested in connection with the Sabarimala temple row. Surendran along with two others had been arrested on 18 November from Nilackal as he tried to proceed to the Ayyappa Temple despite being advised by police personnel against visiting the shrine due to law and order issues. The 69 others were arrested after they held a   (chanting Lord Ayyappa mantras) inside the shrine complex late on Sunday, defying prohibitory orders. Though it is 55 days since the Supreme Court delivered its verdict, no women in the traditionally barred age group of 10-50 years have made it to the temple. Some devotees on Wednesday said they had no problem with the restrictions imposed by authorities. An elderly woman said she was happy that she could offer prayers to Lord Ayyappa. ""I have never had such a good opportunity to see the Lord,"" the beaming woman said. Another devotee said he had been coming to the shrine for the past 12 years. ""This year's was the most satisfying darshan,"" he said. Opposition leader in the state Assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, submitted a memorandum to Governor P Sathasivam, seeking his immediate intervention to withdraw prohibitory orders in Sabarimala and surrounding areas and restore peace in the hill shrine.

Press Trust of India,"Seeking to quell any dissent over ticket distribution for the forthcoming Telangana Vidhan Sabha polls, senior Congress leaders including Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh have been put on job to persuade the disgruntled partymen to work for the party's victory. Patel, accompanied by former Union minister S Jaipal Reddy, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Madhu Yashki Goud and the party's Telangana unit president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, on Wednesday night met Bikshapati Yadav who did not get the ticket to contest from the Serilingampalli constituency. Serilingampalli seat has been allotted to TDP as part of the ""grand alliance"" (comprising Congress, TDP, CPI and Telangana Jana Samiti) for the elections to take on unitedly against the ruling TRS (Telangana Rashtra Samiti). Jaipal Reddy told reporters that Serilingampalli has been given to a friendly party and that Yadav would have a bright future in the Congress. 
Yadav, who had filed his nomination as an independent candidate, told reporters that Patel and other leaders met him and he has agreed to their request. The last day for withdrawal of nominations is Thursday. Ramesh met another leader who unsuccessfully tried to get a ticket for Medchal constituency. The dissenting leader has now agreed to work for the party as per Ramesh's request, party leaders said. Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to address a public meeting at Medchal on Friday. Party leaders said efforts to pacify the disgruntled leaders began several days ago with a group of senior leaders, including Karnataka minister DK Shiva Kumar and Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy, meeting all aspirants to persuade them to work for the Congress' win. The Congress had said it will field candidates in 94 seats.

Sanjay Singh,"Jammu and Kashmir governor  's decision to dissolve the state Assembly was not an abrupt one. It had been under active consideration of Raj Bhawan in Srinagar, the home ministry and the prime minister's office (PMO) for quite some time. What held them back from issuing such a proclamation till the evening of 21 November was an important legal and constitutional point — that the elections must be held within six months of the dissolution of the Assembly. Keeping this in consideration, if the Assembly had been dissolved a month or a fortnight ago, the election process in the state would have had to be completed slightly ahead of the parliamentary elections. In such a scenario, two election processes would have been held in the state within a month. That situation had to be avoided. If the Assembly election had been scheduled even for a few days beyond six months, it would have invited a whole lot of legal complications, and the Election Commission would have had to provide a justification. This was in no way a desirable option. It is now clear that Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be held along with the Lok Sabha election, and both the processes will be completed by 21 May, 2019. The BJP thinks that this will help its prospects in the state, and will also have its positives in terms of government expenses and security preparedness. What prompted the governor to dissolve the Assembly on Wednesday, which was a holiday? Malik said that for the past fifteen days, he had been receiving intelligence that some MLAs were being intimidated, some were being offered huge sums of money, and some others were being threatened by terror outfits. According to him, a government formed through such means could not have lasted. He added that Mehbooba Mufti herself had complained that her MLAs were being intimidated and threatened, and other leaders had also made similar claims. The PDP leader's biggest worry till recently was preventing her flock from splitting. Malik's argument, therefore, was that he decided not to entertain the claims of either Mufti or  . The statement made by the governor, in which he termed the coming together of the PDP, National Conference and Congress as an ""unholy alliance"", is a debatable one. However, it is not his business to decide whether an alliance of mainstream political parties in the state is ""holy"" or ""unholy"". The special status of Jammu and Kashmir gave the governor powers to dissolve the Assembly without making any formal consultations, or without sending any official report to the Centre. Two days ago, Malik had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, and the decision was apparently taken. It was then a matter of time. Sources said that the political leadership in the central government did not want to lose the gains that had been made in the past few months, particularly on the security front, by allowing the formation of an inherently unstable government. The successful completion of   of the nine-phase panchayat election had given the BJP leadership at the Centre hope that democratic processes were being strengthened. While some candidates in the Valley were elected unopposed, in most panchayats, several candidates had contested the polls. The total number of candidates for all nine phases of the election runs into thousands, and the voter turnout has also been good. The security forces and state election commission ensured that elections were fair and peaceful. The decision of the PDP and NC not to participate in the elections had a significant political meaning. While some would argue that the boycott sent out a message that the local body election was not fully democratic, this situation provided a great opportunity for the BJP to expand its base in the Valley. It also gave opportunities to a new crop of leaders, which may not otherwise have happened. The recently elected people's representatives now have substantial powers and influence, through which they can ensure the delivery of public services. The panchayat and local body elections in Jammu and Kashmir will end on 11 December. While the political inclinations of the new leaders cannot be predicted at this stage, it is expected that they would bring in a new thought process, which, in due course, can change the political dynamics in the entire state, including the Valley. While the PDP and NC had decided to boycott the local body polls, the unfolding situation would not be a happy one for either of them. This partially explains why the PDP and NC buried their bitter rivalry and decided to join hands for now, though Omar Abdullah on Thursday said his decision to support the PDP was only tactical. While he had reiterated his oral support to the PDP's aborted move to form the government, he made it clear that the NC would fight elections against the PDP, Congress and BJP, as had happened before. Abdullah has also spoken in favour of simultaneous polls. The state will be in election mode from now till mid-May, when the state and parliamentary polls will be completed. There are clear indications that most parties, including the PDP and NC, were relieved by the governor's decision to dissolve the Assembly. However, the way it was done has given them a handle to challenge the Centre. The issue is certain to be a topic of intense discussion during the Winter Session of Parliament, when the decision to impose President's Rule comes up for ratification.",2018-11-22,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,BJP,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayat Polls,Mehbooba Mufti,Militancy,Narendra Modi,NC,PDP,PoliticsDecoder,Sajjad Lone,Satya Pal Malik","Satya Pal Malik may have dissolved J&K Assembly guided by parties' claims of intimidation, recent gains on security front",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/satya-pal-malik-may-have-dissolved-jk-assembly-guided-by-parties-claims-of-intimidation-recent-gains-on-security-front-5598271.html,firstpost,-1,0
Biswa Kalyan Purkayastha,"Ahead of the upcoming Mizoram Assembly elections on 28 November, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is using all its might to win the last northeastern state where it is not part of the government. The anti-incumbency faced by ruling Congress makes it favourable for BJP to secure more seats in Mizoram — unless the influential regional outfit Mizo National Front (MNF) gets in its way. In an attempt to solidify its chances, BJP has chosen Himanta Biswa Sarma — who successfully dethroned age-old left parties in Tripura earlier this year — to be the party’s election in-charge in Mizoram. Several national leaders have campaigned in Mizoram promising to bring the state into the mainstream fold. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief Amit Shah, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union minister Kiren Rijiju are scheduled to visit the state this week, home minister Rajnath Singh visited three constituencies earlier. While campaigning in the Mamit district on Friday, Singh mocked the ruling Congress over the condition of roads: “ (It is difficult to understand whether the road is in the potholes or if there are potholes on the road).” Singh assured to develop all the roads within six months if BJP was voted to power. “The local government is obstructing us from developing the state. If we come to power, it will be easy for us to implement schemes,” he says. Promising maximum central funds in Mizoram, Singh also vowed to improve transport, health, education and agriculture in the state. The BJP released its manifesto on 20 November during party president Shah’s visit to the state, which included promises such as inclusion of the Mizo language in the 8th schedule of constitution, releasing arrears as per the Seventh Pay Commission within three months of coming to power, providing rice at Re 1/kg, providing adequate banking facilities in rural areas and a house for all the homeless families under Prime Minister’s Aawas Yojana within three years. Home to several ethnic communities, Mizoram shares its border with Assam, Tripura, and Manipur which means that the Mizo-majority state has a large number of voters from Manipuri, Chakma, Bru, Hmar, Reang and other ethnic groups. “Mizoram is one of the most difficult states for BJP after Tripura, due to the number of ethnic groups residing here. Language is a big barrier and we are trying to fix this by inviting our leaders from other states,” says Pavan Sharma, BJP in-charge for Mizoram. Star campaigners from the neighbouring states of Assam, Tripura and Manipur are also campaigning in various constituencies of Mizoram — including Sarma, Manipur agriculture minister V Hangkhanlian, and Tripura MLA Pramod Reang among others. However, while its senior leaders are claiming that the BJP would form the next state government in Mizoram, grassroots leaders are of the opinion that the party would succeed in a fewer number of seats. Hangkhanlian will cover the areas populated by Manipuri voters. “It is difficult for BJP to get an absolute majority in Mizoram. But, we are reaching out to our own people. Due to lack of development, there are fights among various communities. We are trying to convince them to come out and be a part of overall development,” he claimed, adding that the party will win at least five of the 40 Assembly constituencies. Workers of the party claim there is a positive trend favouring BJP in border area districts like Mamit, Kolasib, Lunglei and Lawngtlai. Sarma, who is monitoring the campaign from the capital city of Aizawl, has ordered his team from Assam to cover all corners of the state. Assam’s forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya and other senior leaders are likely to join ‘Mission Mizoram’—to form the government in the state with an absolute majority. “Three districts of southern Assam are important for Mizoram since most people here depend on these areas for the business and trade. There are issues with Bengali-speaking people but nothing hampers the trade relations between two states much. If BJP comes to power, this scenario will improve,” claimed Suklabaidya. The BJP has never won a single seat in Mizoram despite having contested five elections in the state. The party’s vote share in 2013 was the highest ever at 3 percent. Congress and MNF leaders have slammed the BJP for using its “divisive agenda” for electoral gains. Former chief minister and MNF chief Zoramthanga says that the MNF had shied from aligning with the BJP in the polls as the party intended to disturb peace in the Christian-majority Mizoram. He, however, voiced his disagreement with the Congress over its opinion that the BJP will target dignity of Churches in Mizoram if they come to power. “BJP is ruling a large part of the country. It is not harming the dignity of Church anywhere,” Zoramthanga says. The Congress workers in Aizawl claim the BJP is focusing on non-Christian areas. They say the BJP is a cadre-based party with a common agenda of playing with religious sentiments of the people. They are reaching out to non-Mizo and non-Christian population and may be promoting Hindutva among these populations, the campaigners say. Szarita Laitphlang, national media head of Congress and Mizoram campaign in-charge, says, “BJP is polluting the peaceful environment by injecting Hindutva ideology here. But, people of Mizoram will not be fooled into voting for BJP. Congress is winning at least 37 seats.” Sarma, when quizzed about allegations of pushing Hindutva in the state, denies the charge. “Our party is in power in the Christian-majority state of Meghalaya. This explains things. Congress has no reply to our agenda of development. So, they are blaming us of playing the Hindutva card,” he says. The opinions of the Mizo people about the BJP are divided between those wanting to give the party a chance as they are fed up of the failure of the MNF and the Congress in developing the state and those who believe that the national right-wing alternative is not suitable for an ethnic state like theirs. Zoramthanga, too, thinks the saffron party is not fit for a state like Mizoram. “BJP has a clear ideology which is good for other parts of the country, but Mizoram is not their cup of tea. We are happy with the work they are doing in North East but in Mizoram, we are capable of ushering the state towards development with our own effort,” says the two-term chief minister. Aligning with Zoramthanga’s sentiments about self-sufficiency of the Mizo people, Lalrina of National People’s Party (NPP) alleged that none of the national parties is capable of bringing a change in tribal states. “In states like Mizoram or Meghalaya, development can come only if local parties are voted to power. BJP and Congress leaders cannot understand our issues and people are aware of this fact. We won 19 seats in Meghalaya and now in Mizoram, we will win at least nine,” Lalrina says. Denying the allegations of promoting Hindutva Tripura BJP MLA Pramod Reang says, “Our party was blamed in a similar manner in Tripura by the age-old left parties. But, voters nowadays are more intelligent. They chose development in Tripura and they are going to do the same in Mizoram as well.”",2018-11-22,"Amit Shah,Assembly election2018,BJP,Congress,Hindutva,Lalrina,Mizo National Front,Mizoram Assembly election2018,Narendra Modi,National People's Party,Nirmala Sitharaman,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rajnath Singh,Zoramthanga",BJP quest to bloom lotus in Mizoram Assembly faces great wall of Mizo National Front in elections,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-quest-to-bloom-lotus-in-mizoram-assembly-faces-great-wall-of-mizo-national-front-in-elections-5597161.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The BJP accused the Congress on Wednesday of working to deny justice to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots victims and also targeted Kamal Nath, the opposition party's chief in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, saying he was removed as the party's in-charge for the Punjab Assembly polls following protests by Sikhs. A day after a Delhi court awarded death sentence to an accused and life imprisonment to another in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said the probe carried out by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Narendra Modi government led to the sentencing. ""We (BJP) are very satisfied,"" the Union minister told reporters about his party's stand on the verdict and added that people needed to be told that the Congress had, during its rule, tried to ensure that the Sikh riot victims did not get justice. The opposition party did it to save its own people, Prasad alleged. There was no reaction to the court verdict from the Congress Wednesday, but its spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi had welcomed it Tuesday. ""The Congress's stand is clear. This is a legal process, a legal process which must be allowed to work out its course and we are very proud, happy and fortunate that it is taking its course,"" Singhvi had told reporters. Tuesday's court verdict gave some sort of a balm to those suffering for over 30-35 years, Prasad said. The law minister said his party wanted to assure the Sikhs, especially those whose families had suffered, that the SIT would probe the cases honestly, without any undue outside interference, and take action against the guilty. Targeting Nath, who has been accused by some Sikh bodies of having links to the riots, Prasad noted that the Congress had removed him as its in-charge for the Punjab polls last year following protests by people. The Congress should answer as to why was Nath removed, he said. Nath had in the past rejected the charges against him and said he had no links with the 1984 anti-Sikhs riots, following the assassination of the then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. Prasad also pointed out that Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded his mother Indira as the prime minister, had said the earth shook when a big tree fell and alleged that the Congress had condoned the organised violence against Sikhs. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh might have apologised for the riots, but the opposition party should answer if it had disassociated itself from Rajiv Gandhi's comments, the BJP leader said, adding that the remarks had rubbed salt into the wounds of the riot victims. He also asked the Congress to answer why no action was taken against the culprits during its over-two-decades-long rule following the riots. Prasad claimed that the previous Congress governments had set up several committees to probe the riots only to delay justice, adding that in some cases, the opposition party never acted on the reports of those panels. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had constituted the Nanavati Commission, which had said the riots were organised and had also blamed the police, he said. The report of the commission was submitted when the Congress came to power in 2004 and its government took no action, Prasad claimed. He also referred to a commission headed by former chief justice of India Ranganath Misra, whose report had largely exonerated the police and claimed that the riots were not a case of organised violence. Noting that the Congress had nominated Misra, now deceased, to the Rajya Sabha in 1998, Prasad alleged that it was a ""reward"" for his report. To a query about other riots, including those in Gujarat in 2002, Prasad said there were convictions in many of the Gujarat riots cases and added that a Supreme Court-monitored SIT had questioned Prime Minister Modi, who was the chief minister of the state then, for three days and given him a clean chit.

Ajay Singh,"Sharp, funny, vicious and raucous as the political discourse is on social media, it is no match for rural India's pithy street wisdom. A few kilometres away from the Datia constituency in a rural setting, a villager gives me a taste of this when I enquire about which way the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha election is headed. ""  (you need to bake the bread from both sides; overdoing one side will burn it)"". He did not take any names, neither of individuals nor of parties. But nothing could have described better the delicious dilemma of three-term chief minister Shivraj Chouhan as he seeks a record fourth term in the election slated for 28 November. Chouhan has been popular enough to get 13 years on the trot, but that very achievement is his biggest hurdle now. Another five years for him would mean the bread will be overdone on one side. So it is now time to bake the bread on the other side. It is not prudent to predict peoples' political behaviour based on one villager's profundity given the complexity of economic, religious, political and social issues involved in a Vidhan Sabha election. But the sense one gets from an attempt to gauge people's pulse after visiting various places and meeting a cross-section of people is that the feeling is predominant in the entire Gwalior region flanked by the Chambal ravines and Bundelkhand. Take for example the reaction at Pitambara Peeth, a powerful   temporal seat at Datia, represented by powerful BJP minister Narottam Mishra. Sitting in the verandah on a languorous afternoon, priests were engaged in their favourite pastime — political gossip and speculating about the election results. And they seemed to be convinced that Chouhan was on a sticky wicket. Although my intervention in their discussion alerted them, they overcame their inhibition and stuck to their position that the BJP was heavily weighed down by the anti-incumbency factor. Away from Datia to another extreme of Gwalior are the Chambal ravines in Morena where the dreaded brigands known as   (rebels) used to roam not long ago. Till four decades ago these ravines were inaccessible for most people, as their terrains were infested by dreaded dacoits led by the redoubtable Madho Singh, Mohar Singh, Tehsildar Singh, Makhan Singh and Paan Singh Tomar. A biopic on the latter featuring Irrfan Khan caught the attention of people recently and portrayed the tough life in the Chambal ravines. Interestingly, these ravines coexist with pristine historical sites that are treasure troves for excavation and the restoration of certain extraordinary monuments. Nearly 50 kilometres away from Gwalior, three such villages in a row — Bateshwara, Parawali and Mitawali — are home to monuments from 300 to 600 AD. Bateshwara has a big Shiva temple with nearly 300 miniature temples around it. The excavation of the site was undertaken by an enthusiastic and renowned archaeologist, KK Muhammad, who singlehandedly restored a part of the structure from ruins. On the face of it, the site looks like a replica of Angkor Wat of Cambodia. In Mitawali, a Shiva temple on a hilltop looks like an exact replica of the Indian Parliament. I have deliberately introduced the archaeological significance of Morena in order to bring out a larger issue which affects the society and politics of the region. While I was watching the beauty of these magnificent ruins, a big booming sound unnerved me. ""What is this?"" I asked an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) employee who was standing nearby. ""This blast is due to quarry mining in the nearby hills and this is patently illegal,"" he said, adding that although the ASI had written to the state government about the adverse impact of mining on the archaeological sites, the mining continues quite brazenly. It is an open secret in the entire region that the quarry-mining mafia and sand-mining syndicate operate in the region with impunity thanks to the help of local BJP leaders that include even ministers. The fact that the sand mafia even killed a trainee IPS officer near Gwalior did not prove to be provocation enough for the state administration to check this criminal enterprise. The reason is obvious. The economy involved in both these underground activities run into hundreds of crores under the protective umbrella of politics. Since the BJP has been ruling the state for the past 15 years, the party's state leadership is the biggest beneficiary of this mafia operation. Of course, in Gwalior region, this rampant mining of quarry and sand has adversely affected people’s lives. ""It is often difficult to sleep due to the noise of blasts,"" said a resident of Bateshwara. And yet, the fact that mining has been happening in the midst of the election season speaks volumes about the brazenness of the crime syndicate operating in the region. Apparently the reign of terror unleashed by mine-mafias in the Chambal ravines and the hilly tracts is far more dangerous than that of the gangs of dacoits in the past. At the social and ecological level, these mafias in collaboration with politicians and bureaucrats have ruined the life of ordinary people. The fact that the Madhya Pradesh government appears to be acting as a wilful accomplice in this crime is going against the BJP in this Vidhan Sabha election. What appears to be compounding the BJP's woes is the reality that Gwalior was considered the epicentre of Vyapam scandal in which a fake recruitment drive across the state thrived. By all reckoning, the accumulated indiscretions of the BJP regime over three terms bear out the earthy formulation of the peasant who says, ""  (the bread is overdone on one side)"".",2018-11-21,"CriticalPoint,Dacoits,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Election 2018,Mining Mafia,Sand Mafia,Shivraj Singh Chouhan",Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls: Voters want to bake bread on the other side; is Shivraj Chouhan’s goose cooked?,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-vidhan-sabha-polls-voters-want-to-bake-bread-on-the-other-side-is-shivraj-chouhans-goose-cooked-5592971.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Just days after the BJP shared a clip of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee president Kamal Nath  , another video of the senior Congress leader is doing the rounds on social media in which he allegedly said it will be a huge loss if the  . In the clip, the nine-time Lok Sabha MP from Chhindwara is reportedly urging a gathering of Muslim clerics to account for each and every Muslim vote in the state. He asks them to conduct a postmortem on why only 60 percent Muslims turn up to polling booths. ""In the Muslim booths, what is the percentage of voting that has taken place? If 50 to 60 percent of voting has taken place, why was it just 60 percent? Why wasn't it 90 percent? It is important to do a postmortem of the previous elections. If you want we will get it done to 80 to 90 per cent. If we don't get 90 per cent vote share of the Muslim community today, then it will be a big loss for us,"" Nath can reportedly be heard saying. Furthermore, he goes on to direct the members in the gathering to 'identify' Muslim booths and target the voters there. ""You know which is a Muslim booth. In that booth, what was the percentage of voting that took place? If 60 percent voting has taken place there, there would be a reason behind it,"" Nath says.   could not independently confirm the clip's provenance or veracity. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party took strong exception to the video. It announced that it will approach the Election Commission against the Congress, which is 'communalising' the election. The Model Code of Conduct bars political parties from seeking votes in the name of religion, community, or caste, and prohibits politicos from making inflamed or divisive poll pitches. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra   at Congress for practicing 'divide and rule' politics brazenly. He also went on to selectively quote Rahul Gandhi from a previous instance, and said Nath's fresh comments are an extrapolation of Congress president's comment where he asserted that Congress is a party of Muslims. Patra also implied that the Congress was undermining the votes of backward class and tribals. Nath, in the earlier video can be heard commenting on the so-called divisive politics of the BJP and asks the Muslim voters to bear with it until polling concludes. He then uses the hindi word 'nipat lenge' to imply that after polls, they will deal with 'them'. Patra interpreted this one to mean that Nath was talking about dealing with and finishing off Hindus. The Congress  claimed the video   and has complained to the poll panel.

Srinivasa Prasad,"One fine day in 1982, Rajiv Gandhi arrived at Hyderabad’s Begumpet airport on what he called a private visit. He was then the Congress general secretary. Like a king whose privacy was invaded by nosy citizens, he was mighty irritated when he noticed Tanguturi Anjaiah, then the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, along with a large crowd at the airport. The heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty blew his top and called Anjaiah a “buffoon”. No, nobody apologised to Anjaiah for that. Rajiv’s mother Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister, proceeded to sack Anjaiah for other reasons. It was another matter that the humiliation to Anjaiah was repeatedly cited as a mammoth blow to Telugu self-respect by actor-turned-politician NT Rama Rao who swept to power in the state in 1983. Between 1978 and 1982, Indira Gandhi sacked five chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh. In the safe privacy of his home, I heard one of them refer to her with a choice epithet in Telugu. Even as Indira reduced chief ministers into political putty in her hands, she almost always encouraged dissidents against them. She pitted one leader against another to ensure that neither grew too big for her comfort and both depended on her for survival. Indira’s treatment of her chief ministers as vassals who could be kicked around like footballs and dumped in a garbage can like used tissue paper was one of the most appalling aspects of her era. It was no secret that the reason why incumbent and aspiring chief ministers were ready to swallow humiliation was that Congress and Indira Gandhi were a political brand that opened doors to power and lucre. The returns that the power-mongers got for the time and money they invested in what they called politics entirely revolved round her arbitrary pleasure. It mattered little to voters who might be the chief minister in a state. That choice was left to her autocratic whim and sweet fancy. As far she was concerned, if the man she chose couldn’t write his own name in his own mother tongue he was fine as long as he could confuse Indira with India. And for people, Congress as an organisation evoked awe and Indira as a leader turned them into voters faster than Circe, the sorceress of Homer’s Odyssey, turned men into pigs with her magic wand. But, weakened by the Narendra Modi phenomenon and mauled by a succession of election defeats, Congress is now an organisation that lacks credibility and has a leader who bumbles along like a political rookie. Modi is now the Indira Gandhi of BJP, and Congress has none. Faced with yet another round of Assembly polls in five states, it’s time for Congress once again to seriously ponder whether it can afford to play the old game of peek-a-boo in picking its chief ministers in case of what is turning out to be a rare event of the party winning an election. In the absence of a leader in command in Delhi, the least the party could do is to identify and nurture regional leaders, and that process of rejuvenation must necessarily include naming chief ministerial candidates. The party can pride itself on the fact that it has more potential regional leaders and those worthy of a chief minister’s job in many states than even BJP which, despite having a Modi at the top, projects CM faces in state elections. Nominating good chief ministerial candidates before elections could help voters pin hopes of good performance on a good leader, since there is little they can expect from Congress as a party or Rahul as a leader. By projecting Amrinder Singh, despite Rahul Gandhi’s initial hostility to him, Congress benefited in Punjab’s 2017 Assembly poll. And by pushing Siddaramaiah to the forefront in the Karnataka Assembly election this year, the party perhaps did better with him than it would have done without him. One important reason why Congress missed victory in last year’s Gujarat election was the absence of a local face. In Telangana now, it’s a free-for-all between the party’s state unit president Uttam Kumar Reddy and working president A Revanth Reddy for the chief minister’s post. The Assembly election has become as much of a fight between Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Congress as it is between the two Reddys, after it was hinted that the top job would go to the Reddy community. Revanth Reddy aspired to be appointed chairman of the Campaign Committee in the hope that, if the party won, he could claim credit for it and become chief minister. Complicating the matter further, the “high command” appointed Bhatti Vikramarka, a Dalit, to that post. In Chhattisgarh, it’s a mad race among state Congress president Bhupesh Bhagel, legislature party leader TS Deo, backward classes leader Tamradhwaj Sahu and former MLA Pramila Chandrarkar. It will be a toss-up in Rajashthan between state Congress chief Sachin Pilot and former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, both of whom are indulging in covert and overt groupism. From the look of it in Madhya Pradesh, the faction-ridden Congress may either pick Lok Sabha member and Campaign Committee chief Jyotiraditya Scindia or state unit president Kamal Nath. The Congress leadership’s mortal fear that naming leaders before elections would spark revolts by those left out of the race brings into focus the very fragile peace that prevails in the party. Asked about CM candidates, party leaders either extend the spurious argument that it has been a tradition not to identify them before elections, without explaining what’s good about that tradition, or they come up with the slavish ruse of ‘it’s left to the high command’. The smarter ones in Congress talk of the Constitution. They may have a point in saying the Constitution has no provision for naming a chief minister before an election because it’s something the party MLAs must decide after the poll. But also conspicuously absent in the Constitution is a clause that legitimises bonded labour of the kind known as left-to-the-high-command. In the weakened position that Congress finds itself in today, it makes sense for it to choose leaders, whose selection before election would bring in advantages that will outweigh possible disadvantages by way of internal upheavals. For this to happen, Congress must first reconcile itself to its hugely diminished status in India as a political enterprise. There is not only no sign of such realisation, but the party even continues with the self-satisfied pretension of being the only one that can shape India’s destiny. The party refuses to see its dismal score card perhaps as no more than an arithmetical aberration: In 1993, Congress ruled as many as 16 states. And even as late as 2014, when Modi became prime minister, it could boast of 13 chief ministers. Today, it rules only Punjab, Mizoram, Puducherry and Karnataka (in alliance with JD-S). If Rahul is dreaming of victories in the current round in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana, it’s more because of the absence of potential regional groupings to replace incumbent governments than because of any great resurgence on the part of Congress. Indira never learnt from her follies. Nor did Rajiv. Despite the boomeranging of the insult he threw at Anjaiah at the Hyderabad airport, Rajiv, as Congress president in 1990, sacked Veerendra Patil as Karnataka chief minister from the Bangalore airport. Introspection and course correction have never been the strengths of the Nehru-Gandhi family. Congress must hope that Rahul will be different. To begin with, he could stop playing hide-and-seek with chief minister candidates in the ongoing elections.",2018-11-22,"Assembly Elections 2018,BJP,Congress,Indira Gandhi,InMyOpinion,Karnataka,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections 2018,Narendra Modi,Prime Minister Narendra Modi,Rahul Gandhi,Rajiv Gandhi,Vidhan Sabha Elections 2018","Congress' reluctance to name CM faces in Vidhan Sabha polls exposes fragile peace within party, lack of credibility",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-reluctance-to-name-cm-faces-in-vidhan-sabha-polls-exposes-fragile-peace-within-party-lack-of-credibility-5591681.html,firstpost,-1,0

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance. Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue. Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"". He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation.

According to reports, PDP's Altaf Bukhari is the 'consensus' candidate for the post of chief minister. In order to checkmate efforts by the BJP to prop another government, the mainstream parties have been in touch with each other to form a government, according to reports. The plan envisages a coalition between PDP and Congress, which have been partners in a government between 2002 and 2007, backed from outside by the National Conference. The PDP has 28 MLAs, followed by NC with 15 and Congress with 12 which will make up for a clear majority. The alliance is being discussed with the aim of stemming BJP's chances of forming the government in the state again.  the talks to form an alliance are in the ""advanced stage"". The three parties might meet Governor Satya Pal Malik on Thursday, to discuss the proposal, the report said. Sources said that the Congress party is expected to hold a high-level meeting in Delhi on Friday. Ghulam Nadi Azad, leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said, ""I believe in my party members. By tomorrow afternoon everything will be sorted out. An alliance is being talked about in all states. BJP first made the government with PDP, and they worsened the condition of the state."" NC made it clear that they were   but would not be averse to giving outside support to a PDP-Congress coalition. The coming together of traditionally bitter rivals, the PDP and the NC, would mark a significant realignment of political forces in the state. The NC had offered its support to the PDP after the 2014 Assembly polls but the latter ignored the offer and aligned with the BJP. Efforts have also been underway to form a government headed by Sajjad Lone's People's Conference, which has only two MLAs but which would be banking on support by the 25 MLAs of BJP. However, this combination would fall short of the required majority of 44 which is sought to be made by splitting the PDP which has been rocked by dissidence. After the BJP's withdrawal from the coalition government with the PDP on 16 June, Lone is understood to have been approaching disgruntled PDP leaders for forming an alliance with the BJP, the sources said. Imran Ansari, former PDP minister, is among a few others who have been cosy with the Peoples Conference, which has also approached some of the MLAs for joining the alliance with the BJP.

Press Trust of India," Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday alleged that the BJP leadership had knowledge of the attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Opposition party wants the latter eliminated to stop him from working for the people. On Tuesday, a man flung chilli powder at Kejriwal outside his office in the Delhi Secretariat. The chief minister's spectacles broke but he was not injured in the attack. The attacker, identified as Anil Kumar Sharma, has been arrested. ""(Union) Home Minister Rajnath Singh called Kejriwal and asked him to file a complaint in the attack on him. Is this the way an attack on a chief minister should be probed?"" Sisodia asked at a press conference. Sharma's Facebook profile shows that he is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said. The BJP had termed the incident as ""drama"" by Kejriwal, with its Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari demanding a high-level probe into it. ""After failing to stop Kejriwal from working for the people of Delhi, now the BJP wants him eliminated. The entire series of events indicate that top BJP leadership had knowledge of the attack on Kejriwal,"" Sisodia claimed. The deputy chief minister also lashed out at the Delhi Police, alleging it was acting on the behest of the BJP and trying to save the culprit. Even 24 hours after the attack, Delhi's Lt Governor has not reacted on it. This means that he also knew about it, Sisodia alleged. Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said it will hold a protest at the BJP's national headquarters on Wednesday against the attack on Kejriwal.

Ishfaq Naseem,"The National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held a series of meetings the past few days to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir in alliance with the Congress. The NC has sought to have a chief minister appointed from its party. Former minister and NC provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani confirmed to this reporter that leaders of the two parties had met over the past few days to discuss government formation in the state. ""Lots of people have met, and it has been going on for a few days now. One of the formulas is that neither Mehbooba Mufti nor Omar Abdullah becomes the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. But there are also discussions on that the government has to be NC-led. If it isn't going to be led by Omar  , then we are going to have to think about who else can lead us,"" Nasir said. ""There are many people who have met at various levels, and it is good that regional mainstream parties are meeting and talking for the first time,"" he said. On Wednesday, former state finance minister and   also met former chief minister Omar Abdullah. The meeting is believed to have been over government formation in Jammu and Kashmir, but Bukhari claimed he had only greeted Omar on the occasion of Eid-e-Milad, the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. On the meeting between Omar and Bukhari, Nasir said it was not just the two of them meeting, and that such meetings had been ""going on for a few days now"". However PDP vice president Abdul Rehman Veeri claimed he was not aware of any meeting between the NC and PDP over forming the Jammu and Kashmir government. Together, the NC, PDP and Congress have the requisite numbers to form the government in the state. The PDP has 28 MLAs, the NC 15 and Congress 12 in the Legislative Assembly, in which 44 legislators are required to stake claim for government formation. The BJP has 25 MLAs and the People’s Conference, a strength of two legislators. Former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, has also called for a meeting on Friday to discuss the ""modalities for government formation in the state"". Sources in the NC and Congress said the meetings were held as the BJP was seeking to form the government in the state in alliance with a ""Third Front"", which would be led by former minister and People's Conference chairman Sajjad Gani Lone. Former deputy chief minister and PDP MP Muzaffar Hussain Beigh has been meeting Lone for the past two to three months to discuss the possibility of government formation in Jammu and Kashmirs. At a press conference on Tuesday, Beigh had hinted at the possibility of joining the People's Conference to form the state government. State Congress vice president Ghulam Nabi Monga confirmed that the Congress had called for a meeting of party leaders in New Delhi on Friday, and that Azad will chair the meeting. After the 2014 Assembly elections had produced a a hung verdict, Azad had floated the idea of a grand alliance of secular parties, including the NC, Congress and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, to keep the BJP out of power. Monga said that the Congress was in favour of seeking a dissolution of Legislative Assembly at the moment, while stressing that there was a ""need to check the BJP from disturbing the conditions in the state"". However, even as the NC, Congress and PDP are in discussion on government formation, the People's Conference has also said that it was ""in talks with PDP MLAs over government formation in the state"". Senior People's Conference leader and MLA Bashir Ahmad Dar said both Lone and Beigh have held frequent meetings. He added that a Third Front government in the state ""would be led by the People's Conference"". ""Discussions have happened over the formation of a Third Front in Jammu and Kashmir, which would be led by Sajjad Lone. Besides the support of some PDP leaders, we are in touch with some Congress leaders as well,"" he said. However, the trouble for the NC-PDP-Congress alliance in Jammu and Kashmir is that there are a number of legislators in the PDP who are riled up with the party and have even fielded candidates for the civic polls in alliance with the People's Conference. PDP's Gulmarg MLA, Mohammad Abbas Wani, said Beigh's statement points ""towards the muck in the PDP, which has promoted favouritism"". ""We are in support of the Third Front to form the government in the state,"" he said. Lone lauded PDP rebel leader and MLC Yasir Reshi on Twitter as two independent candidates, whom he had backed in the civic polls, became the chairperson and vice chairperson of the Sumbal Municipal Committee in Bandipora.

The article was shared with the remark, ""Because I am not scared of the smear campaign, enticements, vindictiveness, harassments and blackmails (of the BJP). Because I am the most vocal opponent of their venomous politics based on whipping up hatred along the lines of religion and caste, which cares neither for the Constitution nor for humanity.

Justice Sunil Gaur's order came on a plea filed by AJL on 12 November, challenging the Centre's 30 October direction that the Herald House be vacated. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured the court that it will follow court's direction and maintain status quo till 22 November. The AJL alleged that the Centre was ""illegally, unconstitutionally, arbitrarily and in a deliberate attempt"" trying ""to suppress and destroy the legacy of the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru"". The urban development ministry had said the Herald House's 56-year-old lease to AJL had ended and asked the AJL to vacate the premises by 15 November. While hearing the petition on 15 November, AJL's counsel and senior advocate Abhishek M Singhvi had told the court that two officials of the Land and Development Office had entered the National Herald premises. Mehta, had refute the claim, and had said that he would look into the matter. The court had said the Land and Development Office could not take possession in such a way and would have to follow proper procedure under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act. The government had assured the court that it would not take possession of the premises but it wanted to initiate legal proceedings to have the building vacated.

David Devadas,"Politics sprung to life in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday when it became known that the Congress, the National Conference, and the Peoples Democratic Party are in talks to form a new state government. This will have a direct impact on national politics. If this bold move succeeds, it will be a feather in the cap of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has apparently been involved in organising it. A major meeting of Congress party leaders was held in Jammu last Sunday. Other meetings are set to have taken place much further afield. There can be no doubting the legitimacy, and the political logic of an alignment of these three parties. They all stand for secular politics, and the issue they have held up as the banner under which they stand together is the special status of this state. If such a formation takes office, the Opposition will be able to claim, in the run-up to the national General Election, that regional parties have stood firm in states all the way from Kashmir to Kanyakumari against the juggernaut of the BJP's rise. It is up to the Centre now, through Governor Satya Pal Malik, to either dissolve the Assembly or let this sort of government be formed. Of course, there is still a possibility that the BJP might try to form a government in tandem with Sajjad Lone of the People's Conference, and breakaway factions of these parties. Lone has the open support of BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, who visited the state a few days ago to have breakfast at a public event with the new mayor of Srinagar, and other top leaders and associates of Lone's party. The trilateral alignment has come as something of a googly for the Centre. Malik will have to take tough decisions. Having said more than once that he will not indulge in foul play or encourage horse-trading, he is in a tough spot. This alignment appeared to have the support of at least half a dozen PDP MLAs, five of whom publicly addressed a press conference in July, quite soon after the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led state government of which it had been a part since early 2015. The key MLA in that dissident group of PDP MLAs is Imran Ansari, who is arguably the ranking Shia leader in the state. In that capacity, he has pockets of dependable support in several constituencies other than the two he and his cousin directly hold. There is also talk of attempts to wean away breakaway factions from the legislative parties of the NC and the Congress. NC leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah is set to have been reluctant to back the PDP and the Congress to form the government — at least until Rahul spoke to him. While Omar appears to have come around to supporting a PDP-Congress coalition, it seems certain that the NC won't participate in the government. Those who back this alignment say that, given the way the politics in the state has played out since the BJP withdrew support to the PDP, a coalition of the Congress with either the NC or the PDP, or both, would almost certainly come together after the next state elections. ""Why not try it already?"" one of them asked. Omar's father Farooq Abdullah, who too has been chief minister and now heads the party, is said to have been more readily agreeable to the proposed arrangement. However, he apparently refused to take charge as the chief minister — as PDP president Mehbooba Mufti is said to have proposed. Omar — and many others — would probably still prefer that the proposal pushes the Centre to dissolve the Assembly rather than allow the three parties to block the plan about which Lone and Madhav are enthusiastic. In fact, Omar has called for the dissolution of the Assembly ever since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP.",2018-11-21,"Altaf Bukhari,BJP,Congress,Governor Satya Pal Malik,Jammu And Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,NC,PDP,Satya Pal Malik",Potential Congress-PDP-NC tie-up in Jammu and Kashmir will give Governor Satya Pal Malik a major headache,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/potential-congress-pdp-nc-tie-up-in-jammu-and-kashmir-will-give-governor-satya-pal-malik-a-major-headache-5593371.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday described opposition Congress' manifesto for 28 November Vidhan Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh as a ""post-dated cheque of a bankrupt bank"". The Congress does not fulfill its promises even partially, Singh said, speaking to reporters in Bhopal.

However, former chief minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, criticised the governor's abrupt decision, saying the very idea of a grand coalition in Jammu and Kashmir has given the BJP jitters.

It was conspiracy against nationalist people and also against the country at the behest of some forces"". ""We not only welcome the decision but thank the governor for foiling the conspiracy hatched by these anti-national and anti-country forces,"" he added. Questioning the letter written by Mufti staking claim to form a government, Raina said it was her own MLA Raza Ansari who challenged her by saying that he has 16 PDP MLAs with him supporting Sajad Lone of the People's Conference. Former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said Governor Satyapal Malik's decision to dissolve the Assembly ""cannot be a coincidence"" as it came within minutes after Mehbooba Mufti staked claim to form the government. Mehbooba  , ""In my twenty six year old career as a politician, I thought I had seen it all! But like they say never say never! Nevertheless, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to @OmarAbdullah and @Ambikasoni4 ji for helping us achieve the seemingly impossible."" In a series of tweets, she said since the past five months, regardless of political affiliations, the (PDP, NC and Congress) shared the view that the state Assembly be dissolved immediately to avert horse-trading and defections, however, their pleas fell on deaf ears. ""But who would have thought that the very idea of a grand coalition would give such jitters,"" she said. The former chief minister also tweeted a picture of the letter, staking claim of the government. In a   vein, Mufti also mentioned how it was strange that the governor did not receive the fax. ""In today's age of technology, it is very strange that the fax machine at the Governor's residence didn't receive our fax, but swiftly issued one regarding the Assembly dissolution."" Abdullah also said that his party had been pressing for the dissolution of the state Assembly for the last five months. ""JKNC has been pressing for Assembly dissolution for five months now. It can't be a coincidence that within minutes of Mehbooba Mufti Sahiba letter staking claim, the order to dissolve the Assembly suddenly appears,"" Abdullah  minutes after the governor's decision to dissolve the state Assembly. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said that while the talks for formation of a popular government were in its infancy, the BJP government at the Centre was so worried that they dissolved the state Assembly. ""It is clear that BJP's policy is either we or nobody,"" Azad told  . Former BJP leader and former union minister Yashwant Sinha also criticised the abrupt dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, saying it was the latest example of the BJP to not let anyone form government even if that meant bypassing the Constitution. The Trinamool Congress criticised the sudden dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Wednesday night and accused the BJP of having no respect for the Constitution. ""The BJP have no respect for the constitution and destroying every institution in the country,"" TMC national spokesperson and leader of Rajya Sabha parliamentary party Derek O' Brien told  . Governor's rule was clamped in the state on 19 June for a six-month period following the collapse of the PDP-BJP coalition government after the saffron party withdrew support.

Press Trust of India,": Samajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said his party didn't accept a Congress offer for an alliance in Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha polls because the Rahul Gandhi-led party was not ready to include the BSP in the proposed coalition. Criticising the Congress, Yadav said its policies were responsible for the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said that Congress would have ""won"" more than 200 seats out of 230 in the 28 November elections in Madhya Pradesh had it tied-up with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP). BSP chief Mayawati had in October announced that her party would contest Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha polls alone and had accused the Congress of being ""arrogant"" and not being interested in fighting the BJP. It was seen as a setback for the Congress which has been trying to rally opposition forces to forge an anti-BJP front. ""The Congress doesn't give us any importance. That party was ready to allot seats to SP in Madhya Pradesh elections. However, we told them that the election is going to be a big battle and we need to include the BSP in the alliance, but the Congress was not ready. So, our alliance could not materialise,"" Yadav told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday after the launch of his party's poll manifesto. The SP chief's remarks come in the backdrop of the arch-rivals SP and BSP coming together against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh bypolls earlier this year to wrest two important Lok Sabha seats — Gorakhpur and Phulpur — from the saffron party. Yadav has been maintaining that an alliance with the BSP will be formed in politically crucial Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to Lok Sabha, to defeat the BJP in the 2019 general elections. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister hit out at the Congress for failing to form an alliance in the state and said its policies were ""responsible for the rise of the BJP in the country's politics"". ""The Congress would have won more than 200 seats in the 28 November elections had it tied-up with the BSP, SP and GGP. But by not forging an alliance with us, the Congress has given us an opportunity to criticise them,"" Yadav quipped. The SP is contesting 51 of the total 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh. In 2013 assembly elections, the SP had drawn a blank. Earlier in September, Mayawati had tied up with Ajit Jogi's party in Chhattisgarh where the BJP has been in power for 15 years. Meanwhile, Yadav refused to comment on the demand for construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, saying the issue is ""sub-judice"". Attacking the BJP, Yadav alleged the saffron party ""takes refuge in caste, Ram temple etc. when it is cornered on issues like demonetisation, GST (Goods and Services Tax) and its poll promise to create two crore jobs"". Yadav also took a dig at the BJP over its electoral promise to provide free scooty to meritorious girl students in Madhya Pradesh. ""The BJP manifesto talked about giving scooty to girls but is silent on (prices of) petrol,"" he said. Yadav alleged that ""40,000 farmers have committed suicide under the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh"". The BJP has been in power in the state since 2003. ""The BJP had also promised that sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh would be paid well for their produce, but didn't keep that promise. The BJP is known for not keeping its promises,"" he alleged. Yadav also took potshots at the BJP over its drive to develop 'smart cities' in the country. ""The BJP should tell people how many smart cities have been developed. The BJP had also promised that laptops with data cards will be provided in UP, but people are still waiting,"" he claimed.",2018-11-21,"Akhilesh Yadav,Assembly Election 2018,BSP,Congress,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Election 2018,NewsTracker,S&P,Vidhan Sabha Election","Madhya Pradesh polls: Akhilesh Yadav claims Samajwadi Party declined alliance with Congress, as party wanted to exclude BSP",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-polls-akhilesh-yadav-claims-samajwadi-party-declined-alliance-with-congress-as-party-wanted-to-exclude-bsp-5593461.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Accusing Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath of seeking votes on religious grounds, the BJP on Wednesday urged the Election Commission (EC) to take action against him and his party. In its complaint to the EC, the party also accused him of hatching a ""criminal conspiracy against free and fair polls"" in the state, as it referred to a purported video in which Kamal Nath is allegedly asking a group of Muslims to ensure that the Congress gets 90 percent of votes in their booths. The Congress will suffer badly in the 28 November polls in the state if it does not happen, Kamal Nath — who has so far not responded to the charge — allegedly said. A BJP delegation, including Union ministers Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and SS Ahluwalia besides Rajya Sabha member and party spokesperson Anil Baluni, submitted a memorandum to the commission in which the party also sought action against a news channel over ""paid opinion polls"". There has been no official response from the Congress. ""This is a case of Congress spicing up its secularism with communalism.

It is a clear case of communal appeal for votes, he said. The BJP urged the EC to take action against Kamal Nath and the Congress under the Representation of People Act, which bars seeking votes in the name of religion. The Congress leader had termed as ""fake"" another video in which he was purportedly seen urging Muslims to be wary of the RSS agenda. The Congress is a ""history-sheeter"" in communal politics, Naqvi alleged. The BJP leader also claimed that an opinion poll broadcast by a news channel on 18 November violated the EC's guidelines that bar   until the last day of poling is over after the Model Code of Conduct comes into effect The survey had forecast a better show by the Congress than the BJP in the Assembly polls and Naqvi alleged it was a case of ""paid news"".

Press Trust of India,": Looking to regain power in Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader KT Rama Rao said on Tuesday Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is ""on the decline"" and the BJP leaders are ""living in a fool's paradise"" if they feel other parties are scared of the 'Modi factor'. He also took on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, saying it was ironical for him to talk about dynasty in accusing that all benefits from creation of Telangana as a separate state were cornered by ""one family"" (of the chief minister). ""But for his surname, I don't know what else makes him the leader of the Congress party"", said Rama Rao, son of caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. In poll-bound Telangana, BJP president Amit Shah and other senior leaders of the party have repeatedly charged the TRS government of opting to go in for early elections fearing Modi's popularity. The BJP leaders have argued that if Telangana elections were to be held as scheduled along with that for Lok Sabha in 2019, it would have given a huge advantage to the BJP and the TRS wanted to avoid such a scenario. Talking to  , Rama Rao, popularly known as KTR, said the BJP wants to continue ""day-dreaming"" that other parties are scared of Modi's popularity. ""Modi's popularity is on the decline. The BJP has to introspect what went wrong. They are living in a fool's paradise,"" KTR said. He also dismissed contemptuously the charge made by the Congress that the BJP and the TRS have a tacit understanding for the 7 December Assembly poll. KTR said the BJP does not exist in Telangana and the Congress' ""nonsensical accusation"" is the figment of its imagination. ""We are a non-UPA, non-NDA political party. We don't need either Congress or BJP for our state. We have competency to run our state. In fact, if anything, national parties will have to come and seek support of regional parties in days to come"", he said. He claimed both the Congress and the BJP were getting weaker by the day and regional forces are gaining strength. On Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the ""benefits"" after the formation of Telangana had been cornered by ""one family"" (of Chandrasekhar Rao), Rama Rao said the Congress President was probably the biggest beneficiary of nepotism and family politics. KTR said he found Gandhi talking about family rule and dynasty ""ironical"".

FP Staff,"On Tuesday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj announced that she will   due to health reasons. The 66-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh's Vidisha has shattered many glass ceilings over the course of her political career, having been   and an MLA on three occasions. Swaraj   with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in the 1970s and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the Emergency in 1977. That year, at the age of 25, she joined the Haryana government as education minister, thus becoming the country's youngest Cabinet minister. Swaraj was also Delhi's first female chief minister, holding that post from 13 October, 1998, to 3 December, 1998. In 2007, she notched yet another achievement, becoming the   the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award. Incidentally, she received the award from Pratibha Patil, India's first female president. Swaraj contested the 2014 polls from the Vidisha constituency in Madhya Pradesh and was granted the portfolio of the Minister of External Affairs by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. As the external affairs minister, she gained popularity among the masses for being highly responsive to complaints and pleas for help on Twitter, in addition to her wit.",2018-11-20,"2019 General Elections,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Lok Sabha Polls,NewsTracker,Sushma Swaraj,Union Minister","Sushma Swaraj has shattered many glass ceilings: Youngest Cabinet minister, first woman CM of Delhi and outstanding MP",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sushma-swaraj-has-shattered-many-glass-ceilings-youngest-cabinet-minister-first-woman-cm-of-delhi-and-outstanding-parliamentarian-5584251.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"Almost a year ago, Sushma Swaraj met Narendra Modi with an unusual request — to allow her not to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha election. She had undergone kidney transplant surgery in December 2017 after being admitted to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences for around a month. Over the past four years through her performance as Minister of External Affairs, she had the gained confidence and goodwill of the prime minister. On some occasions, Modi had publicly lauded her work, particularly in helping and evacuating Indians faced with distressing situations abroad. Her decision not to contest the next election must therefore have surprised him. After conveying her feelings to the prime minister, she met BJP president Amit Shah and told him of her decision. Her argument was twofold: First, her current health situation did not allow her to take care of the constituency as a serving MP ideally should. A Lok Sabha MP has a whole lot of commitments for people of her/his constituency, which are not just related to taking care of developmental work in the area. Fulfilling these commitments requires a great personal connect with people of the region. Due to her health issues, she was not able to do it the way she used to in preceding years when she represented the South Delhi parliamentary constituency for two terms and Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh for the previous and her present term. Second, if she contests in 2019, she would be committing to that constituency for another five years. Her contention was that she would be failing in her duty as a directly-elected public representative if her health did not permit to be in regular contact with people, which includes paying visits to her constituency. Sources told   she was told by the leadership that she should not worry about that and that the party would take care of her election and her concerns for the constituency. She, however, succeeded in convincing them about her decision. Swaraj had also kept Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the loop. Vidisha used to be Chouhan’s parliamentary constituency till he was chosen by the leadership to be chief minister of the state. She won from Vidisha in 2009 and in 2014. It should be noted that in 2009 when the then prime ministerial candidate LK Advani had advised all senior leaders to contest the Lok Sabha elections, her first choice was Bhopal. Senior leaders in the party also felt that Bhopal would be a good constituency for her. She was then the party's deputy leader in Rajya Sabha. But the then-sitting MP of Bhopal Kailash Joshi placed some tough conditions (demands) before her and she moved to Vidisha, as offered by Chouhan. Fast-forward to 2018 and speculation went wild for a while in political circles after she announced at a press conference in Indore that she wouldn’t contest the next parliamentary election, scheduled in the next five months. It's important to note here that she had announced her decision not to fight Lok Sabha elections, she has not announced that she is quitting politics. That makes a great deal of difference and that gives rise to speculation of the other kind. A Union minister told  , ""She has only said she will not contest the Lok Sabha election, she has not said she won't enter Rajya Sabha. You all know that she has served in the Rajya Sabha for three terms. Who knows, next year she might be in the Upper House to serve another term."" That means if the BJP returns to power in 2019, she might again be a top ranking minister. There could be some other responsibilities, but those are all within realm of ifs and buts. Swaraj chose her timing adroitly for this important announcement. She was in Madhya Pradesh to campaign for the BJP. Due to her health conditions, she had not visited the state and her constituency for a long time. Her non-availability could have caused some resentment as well. In one deft stroke, she cleared her position, something that will allow aspirants for the seat to start nourishing the constituency. Interestingly, this is not the first time that Swaraj has announced that she won't contest Lok Sabha elections. Way back in 1998, she was reelected from the South Delhi parliamentary constituency and then there was a ""smear campaign"" against her for a slogan that some enthusiastic supporters had chanted in the run-up to the elections, ""  Atal Bihari,  (This time it's Atal Bihari Vajpayee's turn, next time it's our sister's)"". She was particularly hurt by the way a colleague who also used to be general secretary of the party when she also held that post commented about that slogan in a closed-door meeting. She was so upset that she announced that she wouldn't contest the Lok Sabha election again and proposed the name of VK Malhotra for that constituency. In that election for the 13th Lok Sabha, the Congress fielded Manmohan Singh from the South Delhi constituency and Malhotra was nominated by the BJP. Malhotra won and Singh lost. That was the only election that Manmohan fought and lost. When nominations were being filed, the Congress sprang a surprise by making Sonia Gandhi file her nomination from Bellary in Karnataka as her second seat (besides Raebareli). Swaraj was instructed by Vajpayee and Advani to forget about her previous pledge (not to contest any more elections) and fly to Bellary to file her nomination against Sonia. Although Swaraj lost, she fought valiantly and polled around 3.5 lakh votes in a constituency that had been a Congress stronghold. Will 2019 see a repeat of 1999 for her or will it be different? Nobody has an answer right now.",2018-11-20,"BJP,ConnectTheDots,LK Advani,Lok Sabha,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Ministry Of External Affairs,Narendra Modi,Rajya Sabha,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Sushma Swaraj,Vidisha Constituency",Sushma Swaraj says she won't contest 2019 Lok Sabha polls: Is RS term on the cards or will EAM spring surprise?,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sushma-swaraj-says-she-wont-contest-2019-lok-sabha-polls-is-rs-term-on-the-cards-or-will-eam-spring-surprise-5585421.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rahul Singh Shekhawat," While both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are expressing satisfaction with the result of civic body polls in Uttarakhand, it is the Independent candidates that stole the show. Among the top posts in civic bodies, BJP bagged 34, Congress 25 and Independent candidates claimed 23, neck and neck with at least one of the two national parties. Independents won more than half the wards across the state while the candidates of both the BJP and the Congress faced defeat in the home constituency of many a tall leader. These two are the biggest parties in the hill state. Until 2017 Assembly polls, when the BJP stormed to power by winning 57 of the 70 seats, Uttarakhand had a Congress government. Eighty-four of 92 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in the state went to polls on Sunday. These included seven city corporations (Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Kotdwar, Haldwani, Kashipur and Rudrapur), 39 Nagar Palikas and 38 Nagar Panchayats. ULB polls in Uttarakhand require a voter to not only elect a corporator for their ward but also the mayor or chairperson of the local governing body. Voting for one ULB—Pokhri Nagar Panchayat in Chamoli district—will be held again. State Election Commissioner Chandrashekhar Bhatt ordered re-polling when it was brought to his notice that ballot papers used at one polling booth there did not bear the signature of the election officer concerned. Of the remaining 83 ULBs, BJP candidates won the ULB head's post in 34, Congress in 25, Independents in 23 and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in one. Candidates of Samajwadi Party (SP) and regional outfit Uttarakhand Kranti Dal couldn't win the top post in any civic body. Among 1,063 wards (result for one withheld), Independent candidates won 551, the BJP won 323, Congress won 181, BSP won in four, Aam Aadmi Party two and SP and Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) won a lone seat each. Thirty-six of these wards had a lone candidate. In the biggest city corporation, Dehradun, the BJP won for the third time in a row. Its mayoral candidate Sunil Uniyal Gama beat Congress' three-time MLA and former minister Dinesh Agarwal. Gama polled 1.62 lakh votes and beat Agarwal by 35,632 votes. Besides Dehradun, three other city corporations had the BJP in power. Now, five will have a BJP member as mayor and two will have a Congress mayor. The mayor post of Haridwar City Corporation was clinched by Congress candidate Anita Sharma in the home ground of Cabinet minister Madan Kaushik. Usha Chaudhary won the Kashipur Municipal Corporation. In Haldwani city corporation, BJP's Jogendra Rautela (64,793 votes) beat Congress' Sumit Hridayesh (53,939 votes) in the race for the mayor's post and got elected for the job for the second straight term. Sumit is the son of Opposition Leader in Assembly and former state minister Indirya Hridayesh, who campaigned in Haldwani aggressively for these polls. Kotdwar, where the mayor's seat was reserved for a woman, saw a battle between the better halves of BJP MLA Dalip Rawat and former Congress minister Surender Singh Negi; the latter's wife won. Though Kotdwar is the home constituency of state minister Harak Singh Rawat, the BJP candidate here came third. Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat's Assembly constituency of Doiwala saw BJP candidate Nagina Rani, the chief minister's own pick, lose the election for Nagar Palika chairperson to the Congress candidate. In BJP state president Ajay Bhatt's home district of Almora too, it is the Congress that won the post of Nagar Palika chairperson. In Bhatt's home constituency of Ranikhet (he failed to win in 2017 Assembly poll), the BJP candidate failed to win the Nagar Palika chairperson's seat in Chiliyanaula. In Haridwar, state minister Madan Kaushik—considered close to the chief minister—couldn't secure victory for the BJP candidate in the mayoral election. Former MLA Yashpal Benam of the BJP won election as the chairperson of Pauri Nagar Palika. Bhatt told   he had already predicted that the BJP would emerge numero uno in these elections. He conceded that the party could have won more seats in Nagar Palikas and Panchayats. He said they would analyse and figure out where they were found wanting. BJP MP from Haridwar and former Uttarakhand chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal claimed that the ULB poll results favour the BJP. He too said the party could have won many seats where Independent candidates won. He said he didn't get why the Congress was celebrating the victory of Independent candidates instead of introspecting. Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh said their party did well with the limited resources that were at their disposal. He noted that the party snatched Haridwar municipal corporation from the BJP and said the party's victory at Nagar Palika and Panchayat levels punctured the BJP's tall claims. Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat, currently a national general secretary, said these results are a red signal for the BJP. He said the party tried to use Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name to hide the state government's failure, but the electorate has made itself heard. Political analyst Surendra Singh Arya said these results, where people elected more Independent candidates than BJP-Congress candidates combined, have given an opportunity to both the parties to introspect. He said not only are people questioning the state government's claim of zero corruption-governance, but the Congress' failure to capitalise on anti-incumbency sentiment owing to mismanagement has been exposed.",2018-11-21,"BJP,Congress,Dinesh Agrawal,Haldwani,NewsTracker,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Pritam Singh,Trivendra Singh Rawat,Urban Local Bodies,Uttarakhand,Uttarakhand Urban Local Body Polls","Uttarakhand civic polls: BJP beats Congress handily, but falls short of landslide win; Independent candidates steal show",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/uttarakhand-civic-polls-bjp-beats-congress-handily-but-falls-short-of-landslide-win-independent-candidates-steal-show-5593881.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Hundreds of people, including some Congress leaders, Tuesday evening marched to the private residence of ailing Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, demanding his resignation, and a ""full-time"" chief minister in his place.

Apart from the Congress, other political parties including the NCP and Shiv Sena also extended support to the protest march, which was initiated by social activists and NGOs.

Press Trust of India," In a potentially far-reaching realignment of political forces in Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP, Congress and the National Conference appear to be joining hands to form a popular government, sources in the three parties indicated on Tuesday. The state is currently under governor's rule which cannot be extended after it completes its six-month period on 19 December. It is proposed to impose President's rule thereafter but the 87-member assembly is not being dissolved, according to Governor Satyapal Mallik. A popular government headed by the Peoples’ Democratic Party's Mehbooba Mufti fell when its partner BJP pulled out of the ruling coalition on 16 June. Political circles have been agog with speculation that behind the scene, efforts were underway to prop up a government headed by Sajjad Lone's People Conference, which has only two MLAs but which would be banking on support by the 25 MLAs of BJP. However, this combination would fall short of the required majority of 44 which is sought to be made by splitting the PDP which has been rocked by dissidence. The sources said that in order to checkmate such efforts to prop up another BJP-backed government, mainstream parties such as the Congress, PDP and the National Conference are in touch to form a government. The plan envisages a coalition between PDP and Congress, which have been partners in a government between 2002 and 2007, backed from outside by the National Conference. The PDP has 28 MLAs, followed by NC with 15 and Congress with 12 which will make up for a clear majority. The National Conference sources made it clear that they were not interested in joining a coalition government but would not be averse to giving outside support to a PDP-Congress coalition. If such an arrangement comes about, Mehbooba Mufti is unlikely to be the chief minister but the government may be headed by a senior PDP leader. Coming together of traditionally bitter rivals, the PDP and the NC, would mark a significant realignment of political forces in the state. The National Conference had offered its support to the PDP after the 2014 assembly polls but the latter ignored the offer and aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). After the 16 June withdrawal, Lone is understood to have been approaching disgruntled PDP leaders for forming an alliance with the BJP, the sources said. Imran Ansari, former PDP minister, is among a few others who have been cosy with the People's Conference, which has also approached some of the MLAs for joining the alliance with the BJP. A former separatist leader, Lone had been successful in breaking away National Conference's chief spokesman Junaid Muttu, who recently contested the urban local body elections and became Mayor of Srinagar. Efforts made to get a response from Lone did not fructify as he did not respond to messages sent by  . A founder member of PDP, Muzzafar Beigh also joined the bandwagon of Lone on Tuesday and held a press conference here and said ""the PDP betrayed the workers, denying them a chance to connect with the people, by boycotting the elections. They left a vacuum and that space has now been occupied. Politics does not wait for people who boycott."" Beigh said, ""Now this talk of NC-PDP alliance. How will people of Jammu react? How will people of Ladakh react? It will be an alliance of one religion. Jammu would not like it, Ladakh will not remain part of the state. This will lead to trifurcation of the state."" A former member of People's Conference, Beigh said he was not averse to formation of a third front led by Lone and went on to say ""Sajad Lone is like my son. I had contested the elections that led to registration of Peoples Conference as a political party. If Sajad (Lone) is interested in (formation of third front), it should be encouraged. People want something different from the beaten track"". ""Sajad has not contacted me directly. The BJP has not contacted me (on government formation or third front formation). However, there are people within the party (PDP) who want an elected government,"" he said.",2018-11-21,"Congess,Governor's Rule In Jammu And Kashmir,India,Jammu And Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,National Conference,NC,NewsTracker,Omar Abdullah,PDP,PDP-BJP Coalition,People's Democratic Party","PDP, Congress likely to form alliance backed by NC for Jammu and Kashmir govt; Governor's Rule in state ends in December",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/pdp-congress-likely-to-form-alliance-backed-by-nc-for-jammu-and-kashmir-govt-governors-rule-in-state-ends-in-december-5588051.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in Rajasthan have fielded 11 turncoats for the 7 December Assembly polls, hoping that the ""parachute"" candidates will shine for them in the elections. Voices of dissent are being heard from both parties and sidelined party leaders are quick to cross over to get a chance to contest. The ruling BJP alone has fielded seven defectors, including six from the Congress and one from the BSP. BJP nominees Mahesh Pratap Singh from Nathdawara, Ram Kishor Saini from Bandikui, Mamta Sharma from Pipalda, Kalpna Singh from Ladpura, Rajendra Bhamu from Jhunjhunu and Ashok Sharma from Rajkhera are the leaders who crossed over to the saffron brigade from the Congress. Another defector from the BSP, Abhinesh Mehrishi, replaced sitting BJP minister Rajkumar Rinwa from Ratangarh seat. Not to be left behind, the Congress has given tickets to at least four turncoats to test electoral waters.

Rajasthan state Congress President Sachin Pilot said the decision was taken by the party high command on case-to-case basis. Turncoats, who managed to get Congress tickets just after a few hours or days after leaving the BJP, include Harish Meena, Habib-ir-Rehman, Manvendra Singh and Zamindara Party legislator Sona Devi Bawri.

FP Staff,"Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan   and right-wing outfits, accusing them of exploiting the Sabarimala issue for their ""political gains"" and trying to 'capture' and take control of the hill-top shrine. These comments were in response to Amit Shah's criticism of the government in its handling of the Sabarimala issue. In his remarks, Vijayan alleged that the Sangh Parivar's agenda was to create trouble by sending ""kar sevaks"" to take control of the temple and making the pilgrims ""scapegoats"". On Tuesday, BJP president   of treating pilgrims as 'Gulag inmates'. In the continued stand-off over the entry of menstrual age women to Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala after the Supreme Court lifted the ban, Shah had slammed the CPI(M)-led government's handling of the situation as ""disappointing"" and accused it of making pilgrims spend nights next to ""pig droppings"". Vijayan tweeted a response to Shah's accusations, saying that Shah's tweets on the issue were ""unfounded and misleading"". He added, ""The pilgrimage is going smoothly. Pilgrims too have expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made. The people affected by the arrangements are the Sangh Parivar elements, who are bent on formenting trouble."" Vijayan also defended the arrest of 69 people from the temple complex on Sunday night and slammed the Congress for opposing implementation of the Supreme Court order. He alleged the RSS and Congress ""have become one"" on the Sabarimala issue. The chief minister asserted that Sabarimala would not be allowed to be transformed into a ""centre of violence"" and his government ""will not compromise"" with those perpetrating violence in the temple complex. He alleged Sangh Parivar was ""exploiting Sabarimala in the name of faith"" and trying to take control of the temple. ""All protection would be given to the pilgrims visiting the shrine for darshan,"" Vijayan said. Targeting the main opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front, he said the Congress' national leadership wanted the Supreme Court verdict to be implemented, but the state unit had a different take. ""Ramesh Chennithala (leader of the opposition in the state assembly) has changed his stance multiple times which ultimately helped the Sangh Parivar politics,"" Vijayan said. Defending the police action on Sunday night arresting 69 devotees from 'Sannidhanam' (the main temple complex), the chief minister said ""conscious efforts"" were made by some people to stay back there even after the customary closing song ""Harivarasanam"" and despite prohibitory orders. ""Most of them have not come to the temple through the normal route but preferred the forest path evading checking. Conscious efforts were made by some people to stay back at Sannidhanam even after 'Harivarasanam',"" the chief minister said. ""Their specific plan is to gain full control of Sabarimala,"" Vijayan charged and named six Sangh Parivar office bearers whom he alleged posed as devotees to create problems at Sabarimala on Sunday night. The chief minister also referred to a BJP circular through which, he said, it had planned to deploy its cadre in an organised manner at Sabarimala to ensure that no young women would enter the shrine on the strength of the 28 September court verdict. ""As per the circular of the BJP, they would be sending the ""karsevaks"" with a hidden agenda to capture and take control of Sabarimala,"" Vijayan alleged. He also pointed to statements reportedly made by BJP state chief PS Sreedharan Pillai, including that the Sabarimala issue was an ""opportunity for the Sangh parivar"" and the saffron party and their agitation was ""not against women's entry"" but against the Communist party. ""Pillai has made it clear earlier itself that Sabarimala issue was a good opportunity for the Sangh parivar,"" Vijayan alleged. Alleging that the Sangh Parivar has a ""doctorate in peddling fake news"", Vijayan said it has unleashed ""fake campaign"" against the state maligning its image. Shah had made the accusation against the Kerala government   on Tuesday. He said, ""If several reports of flushing resting places for devotees and them having to spend nights next to pig droppings and dustbin are true, then Pinarayi Vijayan must realize that he can't treat Ayyappa devotees like inmates of Gulag. We won't let LDF crush people's faith with impunity."" Gulag was a system of forced labour camps established during Joseph Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union. Shah's comments underlined his party's support to devotees protesting against the state government's move to implement the apex court order that allowed the entry of women of all groups to the temple. Shah said the way the way Vijayan's government is handling the sensitive issue of Sabarimala is disappointing as the ""Kerala police is treating young girls, mothers and aged inhumanly, forcing them to take the arduous pilgrimage, without even basic facilities like food, water, shelter and clean toilets"". ""If Pinarayi Vijayan thinks he can rise against people's movement to preserve Sabarimala by arresting K Surendran, BJP's Thrissur district president and six others, then he is mistaken,"" Shah said.",2018-11-21,"BJP,BJP President Amit Shah,BJP-RSS,Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan,India,Kerala,Kerala Government,Kerala Police,NewsTracker,RSS,Sabarimala,Sabarimala Controversy,Sabarimala Temple Row,Sangh Parivar","Sabarimala controversy: Pinarayi Vijayan responds to Amit Shah's Gulag comment; claims BJP, RSS using pilgrims as 'scapegoats'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sabarimala-controversy-pinarayi-vijayan-responds-to-amit-shahs-gulag-comment-claims-bjp-rss-using-pilgrims-as-scapegoats-5590381.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sameer Yasir,"After the collapse of the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party-Peoples Democratic party coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, the emergence of ‘third front’ to help BJP form a government without the support of two main regional parties seemed an impossible task. Not anymore! On Tuesday, one of the founding members of Peoples Democratic Party, Muzaffar Hussain Baig, the brain behind its ‘self-rule’ document, gave a veritable setback to the party by throwing his weight behind the BJP ally Sajad Gani Lone’s idea of opening a new chapter in troubled politics of the state. Baig, 72, a political stalwart stunned everyone by suggesting in a press conference that he was ready to join the ‘third front,’ if it takes the shape of a political force in Jammu and Kashmir. A member of Parliament from north Kashmir, Baig was sidelined by late PDP chief Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on the insistence of his daughter, Mehbooba Mufti, during the previous PDP-BJP coalition government. ""PC (Peoples Conference) has been like a home to me. For me Sajjad Lone has been like a son... if Sajjad Lone is interested ...that there should be a third force that should emerge that could be considered...should be considered... he should be encouraged because people are looking for something new,"" Baig, who has served Jammu and Kashmir’s deputy chief minister and a finance minister, said. Lone, who is seen as the BJP’s man in Kashmir, is redrawing the political landscape of the Valley. His party, through a disgruntled former National Conference youth leader, Junaid Mattu, is ruling the all important Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC). And the capture of power at SMC is being seen as the Peoples Conference’s entry into the heart of Valley -- Srinagar, the summer capital. If it takes shape, the ‘third front’ led by Peoples Conference chairman Lone will further slice the already existing electoral divisions between the three regions of Valley. Observers predict this could allow a chief minister from non-traditional parties—National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party—but with the help of BJP in the state if the BJP retains its stronghold Jammu region till the next election is over. The BJP is now ruling the Jammu Municipal Council too in the winter capital of the state. Lone, 51, an MLA from Handwara constituency who faced humiliation, mockery and taunts in Kashmir valley on social media for allying with the BJP, has emerged as contender for the chief ministerial post from nowhere. His strong bond with the BJP general secretary Ram Madhav and his personnel rapport with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi could well do the trick for him. After Baig’s press conference, Lone was quick to react, hoping to pull out one of the strongest pillars of the PDP and a legal luminary to his side. “I am humbled by Muzaffar Beigh Sahib’s statement. A person of his stature, experience and intellect can be the defining attribute of the emerging third party @JKPC_   I remember him as my favourite uncle during my childhood. I was his pampered brat. @SafinaMBaig,” he tweeted. Baig was once close aide of Abdul Gani Lone, the former separatist who was gunned down on 21 May, 2002 in Srinagar, during the death anniversary of Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq, the father of Mirwaiz Umer Farooq. If Baig joins the Peoples Conference, Lone will end up creating a rejuvenated political block in north Kashmir that his father, Late Abdul Gani envisioned in 1978, when he aligned with Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari, a powerful Shia clerk, to form the Peoples Conference. History, they say, repeats itself. When the political tsunami hit the PDP after five of its MLAs and one MLC openly rebelled against the party, it included Imran Ansari, the son of Molvi Ansari, and Imran’s uncle Abid Ansari. The junior Ansari is a buddy of Lone, a powerful businessman, who holds sway over Shia votes in at least four constituencies of north Kashmir, which has a sizeable Shia population. There are reports that many MLAs from PDP, who have not yet said goodbye to the party, are likely to bid it adieu before the next elections in the state. A scene like this is likely to become a problem for Peoples Democratic Party than for the National Conference. The PDP is likely to face a rout at the hands of electorate whenever the next election are held in the state. The party’s tactical shift post the last assembly election in the form of the alliance with BJP, will cost the party heavily in its bastion. A simple tour through south Kashmir where on Tuesday only 1.1 percent votes were polled in the ongoing panchayat elections, is a reminder what is in offing for the party. For the moment the Peoples Conference has only two seats out of 87 seats in Jammu and Kashmir. Comes next election and this is a possible scene which could play out in the north of Kashmir. If Lone wins again from Handwara constituency, his another MLA from Kupwara, Bashir Ahmad Dar retains his seat, Baig wins from Baramulla constituency, Imran Raza Ansari from Pattan, Mohd Abass Wani from Gulmarg constituency, Engineer Rasheed, who is originally from Peoples Conference, from Langate and four others, with the help of anti-incumbency against the ‘political dynasties’ and their failure to deliver on the ground, could make Peoples Conference the “biggest block in north Kashmir’.",2018-11-21,"Abdul Gani Lone,Jammu And Kashmir,Junaid Mattu,Mehbooba Mufti,Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq,Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,Muzaffar Hussain Baig,Narendra Modi,National Conference,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Ram Madhav,Sajad Gani Lone",PDP's Muzaffar Hussain Baig backs Sajjad Lone's Peoples Conference: J&K may see 'third front' govt soon,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/pdps-muzaffar-hussain-baig-backs-sajjad-lones-peoples-conference-jk-may-see-third-front-govt-soon-5588161.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The Election Commission of India has decided to hold polling for Bru refugees residing in Tripura at the inter-state border village of Kanhmun in Mamit district of Mizoram. The place of voting for 11,232 Bru voters has become the most controversial issue in the run-up to the Mizoram Assembly polls, leading to replacement of the Chief Electoral Officer SB Shashank in less than two weeks ahead of the elections to the 40-member House. Shashank had reportedly facilitated voting by Bru voters in the relief camps in Tripura. ""We have been informed by the Election Commission that the polling for the Brus must be arranged at Kanhmun village inside Mizoram territory. We have started our preparations for that,"" an official in the CEO office told  . A written order to this effect is likely to be received by the Mizoram CEO Ashish Kundra in a day or two, he said. Kanhmun is an inter-state border village between Mizoram and Tripura. The six camps of the Bru refugees are located between two km and 10 km from the inter-state border between Tripura and Mizoram. ""In the last three years, there was no revision of electoral rolls. This time we did that. The Bru refugees are registered in nine Assembly constituencies and we'll place different voting machines accordingly at the special booth in the village,"" he said. The highest number of Brus are registered in Mamit district which has Hachhek, Dampa and Mamit constituencies with 14 percent of the total voters being refugees. It is followed by Kolasib district with 3.5 percent of its total voters being Brus. The district has Tuirial, Kolasib and Serlui Assembly seats. In Lunglei district, less than one percent of the total voters are Bru refugees. ""To smoothly carry out the entire exercise, we'll take help from our counterpart in Tripura,"" he said. Accepting the demand of civil society groups, NGOs, student organisations and political parties, the Election Commission on 15 November removed Shashank as Chief Electoral Officer of Mizoram and appointed Ashish Kundra in his place. They had protested and organised dharnas in front of the CEO's office against Shashank's reported move to facilitate voting by Bru voters in relief camps in Tripura. They demanded that the Brus, lodged in six relief camps in Tripura after they had fled Mizoram following ethnic clashes in the state in 1997, would have to come to Mizoram to cast their votes as committed by the ECI in 2014.

Ajay Singh,"Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is in the reckoning for a record fourth term in office. In the middle of his hectic campaigning, it will do him good to snatch a few hours of rest to watch  , a 1973 Bollywood movie starring Amitabh Bachchan.  is a great story around the issue of making jaggery. A widow, played by Nutan, is skilled in making jaggery from the juice of palm date. The protagonist (Amitabh Bachchan) marries her only for that skill and dumps her after acquiring wealth. He then marries a young girl (Padma Khanna). Since the latter does not know how to make jaggery, our protagonist finds few takers for his jaggery and starts losing his fortune. The complexity of human emotions, rural economy and society is beautifully portrayed in the movie. In the Gwalior region of Madhya Pradesh, the   story seems to be playing out again, albeit in a different manner all across this fertile and rich sugarcane-growing belt. Thousands of farmers have set up their temporary shops on the highway connecting to Jhansi and Indore with a good stock of jaggery. This is an unusual sight as farmers are rarely seen to be acting like traders. A casual conversation with any of them will reveal the truth of rural distress in the region. There were three sugar mills in Dabra, Bhimpura and Sakhni to process sugarcane production of the region. Farmers were quite accustomed to carrying their produce to these mills and getting compensated as per the state advisory price (SAP) fixed by the Madhya Pradesh government in consultation with the centre. But all these mills are closed. The biggest, Dabra Sugar Mill, is accused by farmers of not clearing their dues running into several crores. And all these mill-owners are believed to be in cahoots with BJP legislators and ministers. With all these mills having shut shops, farmers of this extremely fertile agriculture area have been facing an acute financial crisis. For the past three years they have been sowing sugarcane in a quite ritual manner only to face a crisis when they reap the crop. Luckily for them, skilled Muslim traders from western Uttar Pradesh, particularly Muzaffarnagar region, came to their rescue. They set up hundreds of crushers in the region to make jaggery out of sugarcane. These traders from Muzaffarnagar have found it easy to purchase land and raw material to establish a prosperous business. ""They are a very skilled and sturdy lot,"" said a farmer acknowledging the entrepreneurship of Muslim traders and their workers. Then, why do the farmers themselves not set up crushers? A local farmer explained quite candidly, ""You see, farmers in this region are lazy and not as hardworking as these Muslim traders are."" There seems to be a unique equilibrium between these Muslim traders and local farmers who are largely Hindus. And they seem to be weathering this manmade crisis of the sugar industry together. Ironically, the Gwalior region which is flanked on either side by Chambal ravines and Bundelkhand, was one of the most ‘saffronised’ parts of the state. Although the Gwalior royal family (now represented by Jyotiraditya Scindia) owes its allegiance to the Congress and retains its influence, Gwalior became an arena of an intense ideological contest between the BJP and the Congress during the Ayodhya movement. At the height of the agitation, thousands of   were pushed to Uttar Pradesh either from Chambal area or from Bundelkhand. But that is a bitter history buried in the past. As of now, the new issues have taken the spotlight. Jobs are scarce and the closure of sugar mills has caused deep social unrest among farmers whose very sustenance is at stake. People are not swayed by three-term chief minister's tom-tomming of his achievements of having constructed roads and provided electricity and water to people. ""The least we could expect from a government is to provide us basic amenities. Chouhan has done nothing great,"" said many farmers with whom I interacted in Datia and the adjoining villages. As in  , in which the protagonist promises a happy married life to the widow and uses her skills to acquire a fortune, the BJP won over the electorate by promising radical change in governance that would usher in a vibrant rural economy. The voters of this region seem to be in a similar use-and-dump mode   Chouhan. Fifteen years is a long time and the moss that the government has gathered around it in terms of promoting cronyism and corruption seems to weigh more on their minds more than the development of which Chouhan speaks. The brazenness and abrasive conduct of the party cadre has not only alienated a large chunk of the electorate from the BJP leadership, but also made it weary of a political status quo. At first glance, the political narrative seems to building around a ""change"". It is finding resonance among voters. The inability of the state administration and cockiness of local BJP leaders in protecting the sand mafia and illegal quarry contractors is much discussed. Unless there is a last-minute change in voter attitudes, which happens rarely, this poll appears to be going the way of  .",2018-11-20,"Development,Gwalior,Jaggery,Jyotiraditya Scindia,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,PoliticalPlay,Saudagar,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Sugarcane Farmers","Madhya Pradesh Assembly election: Closed sugar mills, jaggery sales on highway spell trouble for Shivraj Chouhan in Gwalior",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-election-closed-sugar-mills-jaggery-sales-on-highway-spell-trouble-for-shivraj-chouhan-in-gwalior-5578751.html,firstpost,-1,0

Although Tharoor is from Kerala, he conveniently forgot that in July 1959, a democratically elected government in Kerala led by communist leader EMS Namboodiripad was dismissed by the Centre. At the time, Nehru was the prime minister and Indira Gandhi was the Congress president. This was the first-ever sacking of a democratically elected government by the Centre in India, and it happened shortly after Indira’s tour of Kerala. Katherine Frank in her book “ ” mentions how Feroze Gandhi blamed his wife for this dictatorial act. The list of Congress presidents and their tenures can be broadly divided into four categories – first, when members of the Nehru-Gandhi family directly held the post of party president; second, when a non-family loyalist became the Congress president (leading to the question as to how the person was treated); third, when the family nominated a chosen protégé as the party president; and fourth, when a person from outside the Nehru-Gandhi family became Congress president when no one from the first family was available to take up the mantle. The fate of the likes of PV Narasimha Rao (1992-96) and Sitaram Kesri (1996-98), who took up the top post in the party because no one from the Congress' first family was around to do so, was a particularly bad one.  , recalled in detail how Kesri was thrown out of his post and the party headquarters in 1998 to make way for Sonia Gandhi to become the Congress president. Responding to Chidambaram, Amit Shah recalled another instance about how the mortal remains of Rao (the only non-first family leader to have been Congress president for five years) were not allowed to be brought into the Congress' headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. Rao had become the prime minister and Congress president in the aftermath of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. He could take up the top post in the party only because no one from the Nehru-Gandhi family was then ready to enter politics. Rao’s name does not figure in the Congress’ hall of fame. Sitaram Kesri, a wily OBC leader from Bihar, could succeed Rao only because Sonia Gandhi was still unwilling to accept any responsibility. Since independence, the family — including Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi — have held the Congress president's post for a total of 38 years between them. In the history of the Congress party spanning over 133 years, Sonia Gandhi has been the longest serving party chief, from 1998 to 2017. The first person from the family to become the Congress president was Motilal Nehru in the pre-independence era in 1928. His son Jawaharlal Nehru succeeded him to the post in 1929 and 1930, and again in 1936. Consider the following — Acharya Kripalani, who as Congress president oversaw the transfer of power in 1947, soon quit the party to form the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party, which later merged with Socialist Party to form the Praja Socialist Party. Nehru was then the prime minister. It is a no-brainer as to why Kripalani would have left the party, after having fought so hard during the freedom struggle to see India as an independent country and the Congress as the ruling party. With support from Nehru, Pattabhi Sitaramayya succeeded Kripalani and remained the party president for two years. Then came Purshottam Das Tandon. His candidature was strongly backed by Sardar Patel. Tandon’s tenure was short lived, as owing to differences with Nehru, he resigned. As fate would have it, Patel died in December 1950. Nehru took up the Congress president’s post in 1951, and continued till 1955. He was both prime minister and Congress president, a tradition which Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi followed later. In 1955, Nehru relinquished the top post in the party. UN Dhebar was made Congress president, but midway through his tenure, Dhebar resigned to make way for Indira Gandhi. With Nehru as prime minister, Indira became Congress president at the age of 42 in 1959. She was succeeded by Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, K Kamaraj and S Nijalingappa — leaders who later were collectively known as the Syndicate and were later instrumental in making Indira Gandhi take a decision which they would rue all their lives. She forced a split in the party. As soon as Indira established her control over the party and the government, the Congress' president's post went to the gentle Shankar Dayal Sharma, and after that, an outright loyalist Devkant Barua, who was known for his remarks — “India is Indira, Indira is India."" Indira Gandhi took over the Congress president’s post in 1978, which she held till her death in 1984. Subsequently, Rajiv Gandhi took over both as prime minister and Congress president, and held the latter post till his death in 1991. Similarly, from 2004-2014, Sonia Gandhi, as Congress president, UPA chairperson and chief of the National Advisory Council, became an extra-constitutional authority over the Manmohan Singh government. Rahul Gandhi is now Congress president. When he took over from his mother Sonia Gandhi, a party spokesperson on television proudly claimed that he was going to lead the party for the next fifty years.

Press Trust of India,": Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray Sunday sought to intensify the party's campaign for Ram temple in Ayodhya by giving a new slogan which called for the construction of temple before government. Thackeray held a meeting with senior party leaders to review preparations for his visit to Ayodhya on 24 and 25 November. Sena leaders from outside Maharashtra too attended the meeting. ""Har Hindu ki yahi pukar, pehle mandir fir sarkar (Every Hindu has one demand, the temple first and then government),"" he said at a press conference which was held later. The Shiv Sena, which is the part of the BJP-led governments in both Maharashtra and the Centre, has been aggressively pushing for the construction of the temple since the party's annual Dussehra rally in October. The party has often taunted its ally BJP over it's ""failure"" to construct the temple in the last four years despite coming to power. Thackeray also asked party workers to conduct a   (grand puja) on 24 November all over the state as well as in other parts of the country where the Sena has presence.

Suhit K Sen,"The Assembly elections that are now already in progress should have been the 'moment' of opportunity that the bedraggled Congress was waiting for after being mauled in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and a raft of state elections thereafter. The lack of a coherent strategy has been caused by and reflects a lack of organisational cohesion. Thus, for instance, the failure of the 'high command' to stamp election campaigns with its own imprint and ensure a coordinated approach in the three north Indian states going to the polls — Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan — may end up costing it dearly. Let us take the states one by one. An alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Chhattisgarh would have sewn up the state for the Congress, on the back of 15 years of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule under Chief Minister Raman Singh. Their combined voting percentage would have been close to 45 per cent compared to the BJP’s 41 percent, if we extrapolate the 2013 Assembly results. The chances, of course, are that this difference would have been higher given a certain anti-incumbency fatigue and the BJP’s current difficulties over the Rafale controversy and other issues, that have cast the party in a noticeably poor light. But the Congress could not put the alliance together, which speaks volumes of its sense of complacency, even allowing for the fact that BSP chief Mayawati is a somewhat erratic and difficult interlocutor. The same story unfolded in Madhya Pradesh, where Mayawati is set to contest most of the 230 seats. The combined vote of the Congress and the BSP, going by the 2013 results, would have fallen marginally short of the BJP’s share. But given the changed situation and the possibility of a tie-up with the Samajwadi Party and smaller players, a Congress-led alliance would have been in a decent position to breast the tape. There seems to be a great deal of voter disaffection in Madhya Pradesh. Some of it is a natural result of having the BJP in power for over 15 years, most of them also featuring Shivraj Singh Chouhan as chief minister. But a lot of the disenchantment with the BJP is due apparently to the policies followed by the Central government — especially, demonetisation and the manner in which the Goods and Services Tax regime was imposed. Between them they have been responsible for causing widespread destruction in many sectors of the economy — the informal sector, MSMEs, trade and commerce, real estate and agriculture took a hit and have not recovered as yet. This has piled misery on many, especially the poor, and has been compounded the government’s abysmal record in the creation of employment opportunities. Many traditional BJP voters are planning to either abstain or vote for other parties. Unfortunately, the Congress has failed to capitalise on this disenchantment by playing an instrumental role in creating a united front. Instead, the Congress’s brains trust, for want of a better appellation, is seeking to counter the BJP’s strident majoritarianism and authoritarianism with its own brand of Hindutva-based mobilisation, not pausing to consider whether it can compete with the BJP by legitimising its ideological positions and political programmes. The Congress' election manifesto for Madhya Pradesh and the position its state unit has taken in Kerala, which aims at encouraging 'devotees' to prevent the Left Front government from implementing the Supreme Court’s Sabarimala order, are unbelievable concessions to Hindu ‘sentiment’. In following the route it has been pursuing, the Congress has isolated itself at a juncture in which other opposition parties have been actively pursuing the objective of joint action. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has rejected, for instance, a late, and obviously spurious, not to say infructuous, attempt by the Congress to build an alliance comprising the Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party, Sharad Yadav's Loktantrik Janata Dal and Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal in Rajasthan. This is being seen by some as being a precursor to the BSP and Samajwadi Party tying up in Uttar Pradesh and in the process shutting out the Congress. In terms of seats, this would not be catastrophic, especially if, as is likely, the combine backs Congress president Rahul Gandhi and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi’s candidature from Amethi and Rae Bareli. But in symbolic terms, such an outcome would be a big blow to the Congress and its claims to leading the alliance against the BJP. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee are already coordinating Opposition action, with a meeting held in Kolkata on Monday. In the meanwhile, both have sounded the bugle by withdrawing a general waiver to the Central Bureau of Investigation to pursue investigations in their states. Naidu, moreover, is trying to bring Opposition parties together to approach the Supreme Court with a plea for the curtailment of the powers of other Central agencies — the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate   — in investigating cases relating to, or 'targeting', Opposition parties before the next Lok Sabha elections. While the Congress has not specifically been excluded from the ambit of this initiative, it has clearly lost the initiative. To revive its fortunes appreciably, the Congress will have to engage with other opposition parties more constructively. As other opposition leaders have pointed out, the Congress, as the only opposition party with a nationwide presence, has to take the lead and make ‘disproportionate’ sacrifices as it did in Karnataka, reaping handsome dividends. Simultaneously, the Congress has to come up with ripostes to the BJP’s barrage of gibes about the ‘ownership’ of the party. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah have been constantly lampooning the Congress over the role played in its affairs by the Gandhi family. Modi has dared Rahul Gandhi to step down and allow someone from outside the family to become party president and, by extension, the party’s prime ministerial nominee. He has most recently pointed to the manner in which Sitaram Kesri was ousted from the party presidency in 1998 after a year-and-a-half stint to make way for Sonia Gandhi. Shah, meanwhile, has likened the Congress to a private limited company owned by the Gandhi family. It’s not easy to counter these gibes because they are substantially true. Congress leader P Chidambaram tried by producing a list of non-Gandhi Congress presidents, but got his history a little mixed up. Of those whom he named, only Kesri and PV Narasimha Rao belonged to the era after the second split in the party and the creation of the Congress (I). Thus, K Kamaraj, S Nijalingappa, D Sanjivayya and others were presidents of the Congress before the first split in 1969. C Subramaniam (interim president), Jagjivan Ram, Shankar Dayal Sharma, Dev Kant Barooah and K Brahmanand Reddy were presidents after the first split but before the second one in 1978. After that, Indira Gandhi was the president of the new party till her assassination in 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi until his, in 1996. It was only after Rajiv’s death that Rao became party president and prime minister and he was followed as Congress president by Kesri, mainly because Sonia showed no desire to become a politician. After she acceded following repeated pleas, which itself is a revealing fact, she became party president followed recently by son Rahul. Thus, in the 40 years after the 1978 split, a Congress leader has led the party for just seven-odd years. It’s a different matter that BJP leaders, too, are unaware of historical nuance, failing to distinguish between the Congress in its various phases, which leads them in semi-literate fashion to equate, for instance, Nehru with Indira Gandhi. It must also be recalled in fairness to the Congress that in the 38 years since Indira Gandhi returned to power — in 1980, a Gandhi has been prime minister for nine years, while Congress leaders from outside the Congress have held the chair for 15 years: Rao was prime minister for five of those and Manmohan Singh for 10. The BJP forgets, too, that Sonia lifted her party up by the bootstraps by renouncing prime ministerial office. It was an act of self-abnegation and sacrifice that may have been prompted by tactical motives but was nevertheless an extremely courageous and self-disregarding one. Self-abnegation, self-sacrifice and disregard for one’s own ambitions are not descriptions one would normally apply either to Modi or Shah. Both are viscerally ambitious, authoritarian, paranoid and power-hungry beyond even the accepted standards of political life, which are not particularly high. The charges made by the duumvirate do not carry much weight because ever since the leadership of the party ceded power to Modi (who inducted Shah as his hatchet man), the BJP has ceased to be the functionally democratic party it once was (as was its forbear, the Jana Sangh), possibly the only positive thing one can say about the merchants of Hindutva. It’s a case, to use a tired cliché, of the pot calling the kettle black. The only difference is that Modi rose from the ranks and captured the party, while Rahul did it as a matter almost of birthright. The difference, such as it is, is functionally not much of a difference. Politically, the Congress would do better by pointing to the BJP’s penchant for trying to capture all manner of institutions and subverting them to subserve its   designs of imposing a theocratic template on the Indian polity. For all its faults, opportunism of the kind that leads it into the terrain of ‘soft Hindutva’, whatever that’s supposed to mean, being one of the worst of them, the Congress cannot be accused of trying to systematically capture and subvert institutions. That’s one arena in which it has remained, generally speaking, true to its mainstream heritage. It should trumpet this achievement.",2018-11-19,"Amit Shah,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,CriticalPoint,Narendra Modi,P.

FP Staff,"After embracing   ahead of Assembly polls, Congress has now played up to the majority sentiment in Rajasthan by wading into the Ayodhya controversy. Playing a BJP, Congress leader CP Joshi claimed that if any government can deliver on the promise of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, it is under a Congress prime minister. The Congress party usually gives a guarded response when directly confronted with the Ram mandir issue. The party, in recent times, have stated that it will   on the issue.

The alliance is expected to eat into the vote share of both the BJP and the Congress. In 2013, the BJP, with 41.04 percent vote share, had won 49 seats, while the Congress had bagged 38 seats, with a vote share of 40.29 percent in the 90-member Assembly. The BJP and Congress are contesting all 72 seats in the fray for phase two of the Chhattisgarh elections, the BSP is in the fray for 25 seats and the JCC, 46 seats. The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has fielded candidates in 66 constituencies. Among the 1,079 candidates in the fray, there are 72 each from the BJP and the Congress. The highest number of 46 contestants are in the Raipur City South constituency, while the lowest number of six contestants are in the Bindranavagarh seat. Of the 72 seats, 46 are for the general category, while nine are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and 17 for Scheduled Tribes. Of these seats, the BJP had won 43 seats in the 2013 polls, while the Congress had bagged 27. The BSP and an independent candidate had bagged one seat each. This time, the fate of nine ministers, the Assembly speaker and a few other prominent leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as of the Congress will be decided. Chhattisgarh Assembly Speaker Gaurishankar Agrawal has been retained from the Kasdol seat, which he had won against the Congress' Rajkamal Singhaniya in the 2013 election. This time, the Congress has fielded a fresh face, Shankutala Sahu, from the seat. The nine ministers the BJP fielded for the polls are Brijmohan Agrawal (Raipur City South), Rajesh Munat (Raipur City West), Amar Agrawal (Bilaspur), Bhaiyyalal Rajwade (Baikunthpur), Ramsevak Paikra (Pratappur), Punnulal Mohile (Mungeli), Prem Prakash Pandey (Bhilai Nagar), Dayaldas Baghel (Nawagarh) and Ajay Chandrakar (Kurud) and also state party chief Dharamlal Kaushik (Bilha). Chhattisgarh Congress president Bhupesh Baghel (Patan), Leader of Opposition TS Singh Deo (Ambikapur), Congress MP from Durg Lok Sabha seat Tamradhwaj Sahu (Durg rural) and former Union minister Charandas Mahant (Shakti) are among the key nominees of the Opposition party. A three-way fight is expected in several seats of Bilaspur division, where Ajit Jogi's JCC and the BSP have a considerable presence. Jogi is contesting from the Marwahi segment, where the BJP and the Congress have fielded new faces, Archana Porte and Gulab Singh. The Kota seat is also likely to witness a three-way contest among incumbent MLA Renu Jogi (JCC), Vibhor Singh (Congress) and Kashi Sahu (BJP). In the Akaltara seat, Ajit Jogi's daughter-in-law Richa Jogi — contesting on a BSP ticket — is likely to give a tough fight to Saurabh Singh (BJP) and incumbent MLA Chunnilal Sahu (Congress). The high-decibel poll campaign, which ended on Sunday, saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah, Chief Minister Raman Singh and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath raising the pitch for the party. They had targeted Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and his family and accused the Opposition party of misleading people during its 50-year rule in the country. The BJP had also recalled the development works and achievements of its 15-year rule in Chhattisgarh. The Congress, however, raised farmers' issues during the poll campaign and promised them loan waivers, bonuses on paddy procurement and food processing units if voted to power. It also accused the prime minister of remaining silent on the ""corruption charges"" against Chief Minister Raman Singh in the alleged Rs 36,000-crore civil supply scam and not acting against the chief minister's son Abhishek Singh in the case of the Panama Papers leak. Besides flaying Modi for demonetisation, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also dared the prime minister to speak up on the Rafale deal, which the Congress claims is India's ""biggest defence scam"". In the first phase of the election on 12 November, voting was held in 18 seats in eight Naxal-affected districts of Chhattisgarh. Phase one of the polls had recorded a voter turnout of 76.28 percent, despite Naxals threatening people to boycott the poll process. The votes polled in both phases will be counted on 11 December, along with those polled in the four other Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Mizoram and Rajasthan.",2018-11-20,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,BSP,CG Election,CG Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Assembly,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018 LIVE,Chhattisgarh Election,Chhattisgarh Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Election 2018 Live,Chhattisgarh Elections,Chhattisgarh Elections 2018,Chhattisgarh Phase 2,Chhattisgarh Polls,Chhattisgarh Seats,Chhattisgarh Voting,Congress,Mayawati,Phase 2,Voting","Chhattisgarh election phase two voting today: State heads to polls amid heightened security; 1,079 candidates in fray for 72 seats",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-election-phase-two-voting-today-state-heads-to-polls-amid-heightened-security-1079-candidates-in-fray-for-72-seats-5578821.html,firstpost,-1,0
Kangkan Acharyya,"The Aam Aadmi Party and the Election Commission have again been engaged in a dispute, this time over the deletion of names of over   from the electoral roll in Delhi. Raghav Chadha, AAP leader and in-charge of South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, on Sunday issued a statement alleging that the Election Commission has deleted more than 10 lakh names from the voters' list without following due process. The Election Commission has denied the claim “When we approached the Commission, it admitted that more than 10 lakh voters' names have been deleted in the last four years. But what it is hiding is that due process has not been followed while doing so,” he told  . Chadha, apart from alleging that due process was not followed, also claims that the Election Commission does not have the correct voters' list with it. He says that this came to light after the AAP made the complaint. “A delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and including Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and myself had recently met with Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat regarding large-scale, fraudulent deletion of voters from Delhi’s electoral roll. Pursuant to the complaint, the commission requested for a list of a couple of areas where we suspected that voters had been wrongfully removed from the list. We provided the names of Harkesh Nagar and Lal Kuan in Tughlakabad Assembly in my South Delhi constituency to the Commission,” he further added. After the complaint, the commission ordered a door-to-door survey in the matter on 16, 17 and 18 November. Chadha alleged that the voters' list the election officers were carrying for the house-to-house audit were flawed. “How can one audit the voters' list without a correct voters' list at hand?,” he asked. He alleged that the deletion exercise was carried out in complicity with the BJP. Deletion of names from the voters' list is a regular process followed by the commission to ensure that only people ordinarily residing in a constituency have their names in the concerned voter’s list. The Chief Electoral Officer has to follow a detailed procedure to delete the name of a voter, which includes informing the voter, physical verification of his or her residential address, and also obtaining signatures from witnesses at the time of deletion. “Delhi has a vast migrant population, and we need to ensure that a voter’s name does not appear in the list of a constituency even after he or she has migrated from it,” says an official working with the Chief Electoral Officer in Delhi. Names of voters are also deleted after their deaths. The official further said that names of new voters are also included in the voters' list after they migrate to a particular constituency and apply for inclusion. The official, a highly placed source in the office, expressed surprise at the AAP's allegation and said, ""Since 2015, we have been deleting 2.5 lakh non-existent voters on an average every year. Only a year-and-a-half ago, all political parties fielded candidates in the MCD elections after deletion of more than 5 lakh voters with the same process. No one complained at that time. I do not know what has happened now.” The source said that 13 lakh new names have also been added to the list. An official statement issued by the District Election Officer in South Delhi Constituency said, “With reference to statements made by Raghav Chadha, national spokesperson, AAP today on 18.11.2018, where allegations have been made about the farcical investigation conducted by Election Commission based on inaccurate list of deleted voters , it is being clarified that all allegations are baseless and without facts. In fact, based on the complaint filed by AAP, Election Commission of India took immediate steps to stop all apprehension with respect to sanctity of electoral roll and ordered immediate house-to-house verification of all deleted entries of the Harkesh Nagar and Lal Kuan areas, as alleged to have massive deletions.” It also said that deletion and addition of voters is a continuous process. A detailed report of the door-to-door verification will be submitted to Election Commission Of India in a day.",2018-11-19,"Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,BJP,Delhi,Delhi Voters List,EC,Election Commission,MCD Elections,NewsTracker,Raghav Chadha",AAP accuses EC of 'fraudulent' deletion of 10 lakh voters from Delhi electoral rolls; poll body terms allegations 'baseless',https://www.firstpost.com/politics/aap-accuses-ec-of-fraudulent-deletion-of-10-lakh-voters-from-delhi-electoral-rolls-poll-body-terms-allegations-baseless-5579571.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Monday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Rajnath Singh and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to act against him in the Elgar Parishad case. His comments came after the Pune Police said a letter seized in connection with the Elgar Parishad probe mentioned his mobile number. Singh said ""thousands of people know that mobile number"" which was in the ""public domain"" through the Rajya Sabha portal, adding he had stopped using it four years ago. ""If Digvijaya Singh is involved in any anti-national activity, then Modi ji, Rajnath ji and Fadnavis ji are free to take action. Show the courage to take action,"" Singh said. Meanwhile, Pune joint commissioner of police Shivaji Bodkhe said,"" As of now, the Pune police are not investigating any case against any politician"". ""The focus now is on the arrested activists and activities of the banned organisation,"" the police official said Monday evening. Earlier Monday, a Pune Police official had said the letter in question was made part of the charge-sheet against the activists arrested for alleged Maoist links in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. The letter was seized during nationwide raids by the Pune Police in connection with the case, following which the activists were arrested, the official said. ""The phone number they are talking about has been in the public domain through the Rajya Sabha portal. Thousands of people know that number. I stopped using it around four years ago,"" Singh told reporters in Bhopal. He claimed that the BJP and RSS were afraid of him and vitiating the atmosphere against him. ""I have neither feared them, nor will I be scared of them,"" he said. ""Earlier too, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister (Shivraj Singh Chouhan) had termed me anti-national. I had surrendered before the Madhya Pradesh Police, which gave me in writing that it had no proof against me, nor was there any case registered against me,"" Singh said. The letter in question, dated 25 September, 2017, is written by an alleged Naxal operative. A portion of the letter reads: ""We must intensify nationwide protests using students. The state forces will be soft against students, which will gradually put the state at a disadvantage while acting against us. Congress leaders are very much willing to assist in this process and have also agreed to fund further agitations.... In this regard, you can contact our friend at (the phone number of Digvijaya Singh according to the police)"". The Pune Police on Monday said ""several numbers"" were found in letters seized during the raids, adding they were being probed. No one has been summoned so far for questioning in this connection, a Pune Police official said. The Elgar Parishad was held on 31 December, 2017 in Pune to commemorate 200 years of the 1818 Koregaon-Bhima battle, in which the East India Company forces, comprising a large number of Dalit soldiers, had defeated the Peshwa army. Police said the conclave had led to violence at the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in Pune district the next day, following which a probe to uncover Maoist links was launched.

Ashwani Sharma," In the ‘gentle’ state, where renaming of important buildings, institutions and schemes has, till now, dominated the political narratives is finding itself caught up in a debate around changing name of Shimla -- the erstwhile summer capital of the British Raj days and now Himachal Pradesh's capital. Till now, successive governments, both BJP and Congress, have renamed some British era buildings, old institutions -- including three leading government hospitals and even changed the names of the schemes. Now, it’s about Shimla. The right-wing Hindu organisation -- Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), backed by Sangh Parivar, has vociferously demanded the renaming Shimla as ‘Shyamala’, thus putting the state’s BJP government, in a piquant situation, both politically and ideologically, ahead of its completing one year in the power. The name change issue has, strong political as well as ideological ramifications in the small hill state but no big again for the BJP. The VHP demand for change of name is not new but has got force following Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's decision to rename important cities namely Allahabad, Faizabad and Mughalsarai as Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhaya respectively. In April 2016, Haryana’s BJP government move to change Gurgaon’s name to Gurugram had provoked the VHP to raise demand for Shimla, which the then Congress government led by Virbhadra Singh turned down the plea for ‘want of justification and basis’. “What the VHP is asking is not even the change of name it’s only about a correction or correct pronunciation of the name Shimla,” says Aman Puri, state VHP president. He says Shimla's name was derived from its patron Goddess Shyamla Devi, which is the incarnation of Ma Kali, whose popular temple still exists in the town. The Britishers had some bias against word Shyamala, thus they addressed it Simla, which later changed as Shimla, and his list of names of towns and places, however, doesn't stop at Shimla. Two other towns of Dalhousie and Nurpur are also on the VHP’s wish-list for the state’s BJP government for a probable name change. The two-lakh population town — Shimla — has not only an interesting history but several British landmarks, which have made it a place of world-wide attraction. There is no concrete evidence to suggest how and why the Britishers named it as ‘Simla’. Definitely, there must have existed some place, house, temple or village making the basis for the name. Shimla was selected by the Britishers because of its climate similar to England and at that time it was untouched by human habitations. There were dense wooded forests around, walkways and fascinating hill slopes. The Britishers loved the place so much they decided to make it as the summer capital of India in 1864. Thereafter, the process of building the town, its infrastructure started. The first building which came up in Shimla was the Kennedy House, which led to the establishment of a series of institutions and buildings, few of these stand witness to town’s colonial past. But how about the sudden demand of right ideology groups to change Shimla to Shyamala? Chetan Singh, a history scholar and former Director Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) says, “Demand is a far cry and will amount to negation of history. Shimla is not simply a place, there is history buried deep in its soil, majestic buildings and places. There is no evidence suggesting the existence of temple named Shyamala. There are, of course, spoken stories about it, but no documentary or archaeological evidence.” Renaming of cities in India is not a new trend which the rightist ideologists are trying to impose. During the post-1947, several towns and places witnessed changes in their names after approval from the Government of India. The VHP has thus build up the argument saying it was asking only for correction as was done in case of Orissa to Odisha, Pondicherry to Puducherry, Bombay to Mumbai, Uttranchal to Uttrakhand, Calcutta to Kolkata and Bangalore to Bengaluru. “Very soon, we are going to have a state level conference. Now since the issue of Ram temple is also getting focussed, together we will push for Shimla’s case,” says Puri. The demand, however, has no takers among citizens. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur after his initial response to ‘examine and study ‘the issue says, ""Right now there is no proposal before us for changing Shimla’s name. The government keep getting suggestions from different sections of society. Since the names of some cities were changed recently, it was natural that demand was raised afresh.” Thakur, a first-time chief minister, who has chosen to run the affairs of the state without getting himself embroiled into controversies is not very much in favour of changing names unlike his counterparts in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat. “I wonder how media chose to make such big headlines,” he says, adding that being a small state, where sentiments of the citizens some time strongly override the political agenda, such a decision becomes tough unlike bigger states. The government as such has no agenda on changing names unless there lies a justification or a strong basis. The fact remains that Sangh Parivar which forms part of the BJP government’s ideological agenda will definitely keep hammering or injecting mythological justifications. Shimla’s former mayor and CPM leader Tikender Singh Panwar argues “the name of Shyamala has never been found in any of the gazetteers printed by the British, though these contained very minute details as well. Nowhere has the name Shyamala been mentioned in the texts available with the Shimla’s civic body”. Some old records reveals that early local communities, which inhabited the Shimla ridge, especially residing in the villages around Shimla hill were under the two princely states -- Koti and Keonthal (Junga). They too had no any deity named Shyamala. It seems both the ‘states’ had ‘Tara Devi’ as their deity. The other communities had their own devtas/deities. None of them was called ‘Shyamala’. These facts are endorsed by Chetan Singh and Panwar. Another Shimla historian Raaja Bhasin, who is also the author of several books in Shimla’s colonial past also disputes the VHP claim. ""I haven't found any document on Shyamala Devi temple in the town. Some references about Alexander Gerard, a Britisher, are definitely (there). He referred to Shimla as Shemla. Few people even called as Shimlu or Shimlah."" He believes renaming Shimla as Shyamala will neither enhance Shimla’s USP as world-famed tourists destination nor its rich glory. It will rather be a huge blow to the town’s legacy. Former BJP chief minister Shanta Kumar in 1991-92 took a decision to change the name of Dalhousie -- another famous hill destination as Subhash Nagar. The proposal did not work though he did manage to change the name of Shimla's Rippen Hospital as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhaya (DDU) hospital. Earlier to this Snowdown Hospital was also named as Indira Gandhi Medical College Hospital and Lady Reading hospital as Kamla Nehru Hospital. Shanta Kumar's government also changed the name of historic Peterhoff, a majestic British era building which once housed the Raj Bhawan but was later gutted in a fire and rebuilt as Meghdoot hotel. This was changed back to Peterhoff again. This is place where trial of Nathu Ram Godse took place in Mahatama Gandhi’s assassination case. The famous Scandal Point — a hub of tourists activity in Shimla town was changed to Lala Lajpat Rai — noted freedom fighter but even now Scandal Point is more famous for its name. Some of Shimla’s landmarks like Viceregal Lodge, which hosts the Indian Instituted of Advanced Study, the UNSECO heritage narrow gauge railway line, Ellerslie – the government secretariat building, Barnes’ court (currently Raj Bhawan), Historic Gaiety Theatre, Annandale ground, Shimla drinking water supply built by the Britishers. The visits of Mahatama Gandhi ,Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Abdul Ghaffar Khan and several other noted freedom fighters to Shimla for working out modalities on India's Independence, thereafter the Post-Independence Simla Agreement on 2 July, 1972 between Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and his Pakistani counterpart Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, will remain biggest historical challenges, if the Himachal Pradesh government seeks to change Shimla's name.",2018-11-20,"Congress,Himachal Pradesh,InMyOpinion,Jai Ram Thakur,Sangh Parivar,Shimla,States,Tikender Singh Panwar,Virbhadra Singh,Vishva Hindu Parishad","From Shimla to Shyamala?

Suhit K Sen,"Six months, say, after demonetisation the jury may have been out, but within a year it had trooped back into the court and delivered an emphatic verdict: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cloak-and-dagger exercise was a quixotic measure that slowed down the economy, striking hardest at sectors that were the most vulnerable and thus adversely affecting people who were most marginal. We shall count the costs as we proceed. Now, two years on, Modi has cold comfort to offer those most badly affected by demonetisation. At an election meeting in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, the prime minister added insensitivity to his political arsenal with remarks that do not befit his office. Only the Congress and one family, he said, were still crying because what they had pilfered over four generations had been lost in one fell swoop. And then came the piece de resistance. ‘Even an old man who loses his son recovers in a year. Imagine how much they must have lost that they are still finding it difficult to recover after two years (of demonetisation),’ Modi said. Around 50 people died as an indirect result of demonetisation, most of them taking ill after queueing for hours to change old notes for emergency expenses. Modi and other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were conspicuous in their refusal to reach out to the bereaved. The tenor of their public statements about demonetisation was always the same: marked by the hackneyed theme that short-term pain was necessary to achieve long-term gains. It ignored the simple fact that those who bore the pain did not reap the gain. As it happens, demonetisation failed to achieve any of its stated objectives. Modi’s surgical strike failed to ‘capture’ any black money: a report released by the Reserve Bank of India earlier this year admitted that over 99 per cent of the demonetised currency had re-entered the system. In any case, as had been pointed out in the wake of demonetisation, only a minuscule part of ‘black’ wealth was (and still is, for that matter) held in currency notes, the bulk being re-materialised as real estate, gold and other precious metals, and offshore bank accounts. This fact also makes, in a logical sense, Modi’s comment on the Congress and the Gandhi family’s assets purely nonsensical. Modi and others had also said in November 2016 that demonetisation would cramp terrorist activities and infiltration by flushing out counterfeit notes. In comparison with 2016, in fact, the numbers of both these rose in 2017. What demonetisation did (along with the shambolic rolling out of the Goods and Services Tax) was slow down the economy. The informal economy and micro, small and medium enterprises (most of which operate in the unorganised sector) were the worst affected because their transactions are predominantly based on cash. And since these are the sectors in which the most vulnerable sections of the population are concentrated, this meant that those least able to withstand sudden economic shocks were called upon to bear the brunt of the toxic quixotry of demonetisation. But demonetisation was politically a success for the BJP. Its most important victory since the constellation of electoral successes in 2013-14, was recorded in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, where Assembly elections began barely three months after the demonetisation announcement: the party won 312 of 403 seats. We still don’t know fully how that played out. One convincing explanation is that some kind of schadenfreude was at work: many amongst the poorest felt that given the struggle for survival they had to go through every day anyway the additional burden imposed by demonetisation did not amount to much, but the costs it imposed on the wealthy or well-off justified the move. At any rate, any kind of misreading of demonetisation — its effects and the motivations that drove it – have now been convincingly dispelled. In July 2018, an opinion poll found that Modi’s popularity, or approval rating, had fallen below the 50 per cent benchmark for the first time. Demonetisation played a significant role in making that happen. Subsequently, his government's handling of the Rafale controversy has further struck at the BJP's image. This is the most likely explanation for Modi’s completely out-of-line remark on parental bereavement. But it is also in consonance the traits of unmistakable solipsism and, arising from that, a lack of empathy.",2018-11-18,"BJP,Black Money,Congress,Demonetisation,Demonetisation Deaths,Economy,GST,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,PoliticalPlay,Shahdol,Surgical Strike,Terrorism,Two Years Of Demonetisation",Modi's use of 'old man and dead son' metaphor to deride Congress is insensitive and unbecoming,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/modis-use-of-old-man-and-dead-son-metaphor-to-deride-congress-is-insensitive-and-unbecoming-5571841.html,firstpost,-1,0
Debobrat Ghose,"Despite Ajit Jogi quitting the party, Congress is upbeat about its chances in Chhattisgarh as the state votes for a new Assembly in the second phase of polls on Tuesday. PL Punia, the Congress leader who is spearheading the party's effort is basking in confidence that the party would do well. ""It’s a direct fight between the ruling BJP and us,"" says a Punia, All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of the state. His party, which has been out of power in the state for 15 long years, is trying hard to bridge the slender vote deficit vis-a-vis the BJP. Punia, a Rajya Sabha member, is certain that the well-coordinated efforts of grassroots workers and the top leadership will ensure a thumping victory for the Congress. Speaking to   on the eve of the second phase of polls in the state, he provides a low down of the party’s prospects and rumours dogging its poll campaign. Edited excerpts: Congress is confident of winning Chhattisgarh election with a comfortable margin. Our party is well prepared to take the ruling BJP by the horns. Right from Chhattisgarh Congress’ top leadership to workers at the grassroots in the state, all are working hard on the ground to achieve this goal. In the last Assembly election in 2013, the margin between the Congress and the BJP was less than 1 percent. This time our party workers have taken a strong resolve to fight the BJP out of power. The JCC-BSP alliance won’t have any impact on Congress. If one moves around in Chhattisgarh, one will get to know that Ajit Jogi or his party JCC, has hardly any presence across the state and even in public domain, he is rarely discussed. Moreover, the BSP virtually has no presence in this election. No way. It’s out of the question. We don’t need Ajit Jogi. In fact, it was Jogi who had said that he would support the BJP. But when the BSP chief Mayawati said a stern no to it, he backtracked. There’s not one but several factors. There’s severe discontent among farmers, as the Raman Singh government has reduced the minimum support price (MSP) on several products and they failed to get the bonus promised to them by the state government. As a result, the tribal and farmers are left to suffer. We’ve included the issue of MSP in our manifesto and given top priority to farmer’s issue. Unemployment is on the rise and youth is frustrated. Young people want change. Besides the issue of corruption, small traders have been hit due to demonetisation and poor implementation of Good and Services Tax. As a result, farmers, labourers, youth, students, Adivasis and small traders – all are with us. Even a large section of government employees have expressed their support to the Congress. Mere construction of buildings and roads can’t be development. Where are the doctors in hospitals, teachers in educational institutions? Moreover, in the name of development, there’s rampant corruption. If there’s so much development taking place, why is there so much unemployment? When the BJP started feeling that they would badly lose, they started manufacturing lies and began making baseless allegations, spreading fake news and rumours. There’s not an iota of truth in this. At many places, even the government machinery has been used for this purpose. The fact is that the state leadership of Congress along with the AICC in-charge has been working as a team. Our distribution of tickets to candidates has been 100 percent better than that of the BJP. At one or two places, there had been some disgruntlement over ticket distribution. It happens in any party. The dissent expressed by some candidates who didn’t get tickets had been an immediate reaction and was temporary. Congress is like a family and there’s no disagreement, I can assure about that. Out of 18 seats that went to polls in the first phase (in the Bastar division), 12 were won by the Congress in the last elections in 2013. We’re not losing seats in Bastar and are expecting to take the tally to 15 seats this time in the first phase of polling.

Indo-Asian News Service," The BJP, which is determined to oust the Congress in Mizoram after forming governments on its own or in alliance in the seven northeastern states, on Sunday urged the Reang tribal refugees, sheltered in Tripura to vote for the saffron party in the 28 November Assembly polls. Three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders — Assam's minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP's Tripura Pradesh General Secretaries Pratima Bhowmik and Rajib Bhattacharjee — on Sunday addressed a gathering of Reang tribal refugees at Gachiram Para in northern Tripura adjoining Mizoram. The leaders appealed to the immigrants to vote for the party candidates contesting Mizoram Assembly polls. Over 35,000 Reang tribal refugees, comprising 5,907 families, fled from Mizoram and have been staying in Tripura's Kanchanpur and Panisagar sub-divisions for the past 21 years following ethnic tension after a Mizo forest official was killed in the neighbouring state. Among the refugees, only a little over 11,232 immigrants are eligible to vote in the November 28 elections to constitute a new 40-member Assembly in the Congress-ruled Mizoram. The BJP has put up 39 candidates this time while the party in the 2013 Assembly polls had had fielded 17 candidates and secured only 0.37 percent of the votes. ""If the BJP comes to power in Mizoram, all the problems of Reang and other tribals would be solved. The Congress did nothing for the development of the state and also for the minority tribals,"" Assam's minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told the gathering. He said that the four-partite agreement signed in Delhi on 3 July to resolve the refugee problems and to repatriate the tribals to Mizoram, was faulty and the BJP would do justice to the refugees if the party voted to power in the polls. In the Mizoram elections, a multi-cornered contest would be witnessed between the ruling Congress, BJP and Mizo National Front (MNF), a regional party, which ruled the state for two terms (1998-2003, and 2003-2008). Though the MNF is a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), no pre-poll alliance was formed between the BJP and MNF. Political experts predict that after the polls, the MNF might forge an alliance with the BJP to form the government.",2018-11-18,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Mizoram,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,MNF,Reang","Mizoram Assembly election: BJP urges Reang refugees in Tripura to vote for it, says Congress 'did nothing' for state's development",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-assembly-election-bjp-urges-reang-refugees-in-tripura-to-vote-for-it-says-congress-did-nothing-for-states-development-5573381.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": With the Congress keeping open the issue of its leadership in Rajasthan, party stalwart and two-time chief minister Ashok Gehlot said Sunday no post is a priority for him and that he will abide by the decision of the high command on the chief ministerial post if the party comes to power. The Congress on Wednesday ended the suspense over whether Gehlot and Rajasthan state party chief Sachin Pilot would contest the 7 December Assembly polls by deciding to field both of them. While Gehlot, 67, is a sitting MLA from Sardarpura, Pilot, 41, is contesting the state poll for the first time from Tonk. Pilot has been a former MP from Dausa and then from Ajmer. Not ruling himself out of the race for the top post in the state should Congress win, Gehlot in an exclusive interview to   said he would be open to any role Congress president Rahul Gandhi assigns him in the interest of the party. ""I am ready for whatever role Congress president gives me. I am against any kind of lobbying for any position. I have never lobbied even when I faced dissidence as chief minister. If they (the high command) send me to Rajasthan in party interest, it will be their decision,"" the powerful All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary said. He said he is ""more than satisfied"" with his long political career as a five-time Lok Sabha MP, three time Union minister and chief minister for 10 years. ""No post is a priority for me. I am more than satisfied with my political innings and the question before me now is how to bring the party in power in Rajasthan first and then in the country under the leadership of Congress president Rahul Gandhi. I will be ready for any role I am assigned,"" he said when asked if he is in the race for chief ministership should Congress come to power. Asked whether the fact that all top state leaders contesting elections in Rajasthan will trigger a leadership tussle, after the polls, Gehlot said the ""issue of chief minister will be amicably resolved by the party high command which will take a decision on three grounds - party interest, public and MLAs' sentiments."" ""There will be no problem. The high command's decision will be acceptable to all... Whatever they decide will be acceptable to all,"" he said, accusing the BJP of raising the chief minister issue for political reasons. On whether there will be a new chief ministerial face other than him or Pilot, Gehlot said it will be the party high command's decision. He also said the decision on who the next chief minister will be shall not be hampered by the presence of the entire top state brass in elections. On being asked why all state leaders were contesting in Rajasthan, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, he said it was a decision which the Congress president has taken, and he welcomed it. ""The politics in Rajasthan is different and the Congress leadership believes that all the leaders who wish to contest should do so,"" Gehlot said. ""I want the party's flag to fly high both in Rajasthan and across the country, as the present atmosphere is dangerous for the country and people want the Congress to return to power both in the state and at the Centre,"" he added. The AICC general secretary said the party has a tradition of not declaring its chief minister candidate in advance and that tradition will be respected. He alleged that it was a BJP conspiracy to raise such an issue to create divisions within the Congress and the people understand this. ""The BJP does not have any right to ask who the Congress chief ministerial face is, as they themselves did not have a state party chief for 75 days,"" Gehlot said. On giving tickets to parachute candidates, he said former BJP leader Manvendra Singh has been fielded against chief minister Vasundhara Raje based on a political strategy and is an exception. Gehlot said the Congress will soon declare its manifesto, which will spell out steps to tackle farm distress and to improve the law and order. ""There is a lot of anger against the chief minister that will favour the Congress,"" he claimed, adding that his party will provide ""good alternative governance with all-round development and ensure welfare of all"". He, however, admitted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign and BJP chief Amit Shah's organisational skills may help the BJP reclaim a bit, but said people of the state have decided to oust the Raje government in the state and the BJP from the country.",2018-11-18,"Amit Shah,Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Manvendra Singh,Narendra Modi,NewsTracker,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Sachin Pilot,Sardarpura,Tonk,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan polls: Ashok Gehlot says he will abide by high command' decision on CM's post, asserts he is open to any role",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-ashok-gehlot-says-he-will-abide-by-high-command-decision-on-cms-post-asserts-he-is-open-to-any-role-5573531.html,firstpost,-1,0

In his efforts to get more seats in the 2019 polls, Kejriwal has been holding rallies in Haryana and inviting people of the state to visit AAP's mohalla clinics and government schools to see the work done by his government. He had also invited Khattar to visit the clinics after the Haryana chief minister dismissed the mohalla clinics as chaotic or ""halla clinics"".

Press Trust of India,": Hitting out at the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday claimed that Dailt leader Sitaram Kesri was not allowed to complete his term as Congress president and was ""thrown out of office"" to make way for Sonia Gandhi. Addressing a rally on the last day of campaigning for the second and final phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly polls, Modi said four generations of a family ruled the country and ""benefitted from being in power"", but the country did not benefit from their rule. ""The country knows that Sitaram Kesri, a Dalit, was not allowed to complete his five-year-term as the Congress president. He was thrown out of office and to the footpath to make way for Sonia Gandhi as the new party chief,"" he said. ""Earlier, Delhi had a remote-controlled government. The remote was in the hands of a family, which was afraid of the BJP,"" Modi said, targeting the Congress and the Gandhis. He challenged the Congress to select someone ""capable"" as its president, who did not belong to ""that one family"". ""Remember the days when four generations of a family ruled the country. What was the fate of the people? They only thought about the welfare of one family but never thought about the welfare of the people. How can we trust them that they will fulfill the aspirations of the people now,"" Modi said. He claimed that Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh had to face a lot of challenges from the then Congress-led government at the Centre. ""For 10 years, the Centre was ruled by a remote-control government, which never paid attention towards Chhattisgarh,"" the prime minister said. He praised the high voter turnout in Bastar in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh polls on 12 November and also in the panchayat election in Jammu and Kashmir and claimed that the people had given a befitting reply to those spreading terror. ""Despite being threatened by Maoists with guns and bombs, a huge voter turnout was recorded in Bastar. The poor tribals have shown faith in democracy and given a befitting reply to bombs and guns,"" Modi said. ""Similarly, yesterday, elections were held for the panchayats in Kashmir. Earlier, people used to skip conducting polls there. After Governor's Rule was imposed, we decided that the power of Kashmir should rest in the hands of the people of Kashmir. Terrorists had given a bandh call in Kashmir, but look at the trust of the people of Kashmir in democracy as a voter turnout of around 60-70 percent was recorded. They have given a slap on the face of separatism and terrorism. They have shown the strength of democracy,"" he added. Jammu and Kashmir recorded 74.1 percent polling in the first phase of the panchayat polls held Saturday in 47 blocks - 16 in Kashmir, 21 in Jammu and 10 in the Ladakh region. Lashing out at the Congress, Modi said. ""The doors have been opened for the welfare of Kashmir. Who had stopped the Congress from doing this earlier? They played backdoor games with terrorists which will not be allowed anymore. We took courageous steps one by one."" He also targeted Congress chief Rahul Gandhi over farm loan waiver, an issue that has taken centre stage in the Chhattisgarh polls. ""As elections approach, the Congress plays a game of promises. But they cannot mislead the country anymore. They must answer what did they do for the welfare of our farmers when they ruled for four generations. They kept the farmers in a pathetic condition during their 50-year rule. Had they strengthened the farmers, fulfilled their requirements, our farmers would have been prosperous,"" the prime minister said. ""They are making false promises of loan waiver to the people of Chhattisgarh. The same promise was made to farmers during the Karnataka polls, but even after around a year has passed, the promise is yet to be fulfilled. Instead, the (Karnataka) government is issuing warrants and arresting farmers against whom debts are pending,"" he added. Praising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under Raman Singh in the state, Modi said it had ensured soil health cards for 75 lakh farmers, adding in a sarcastic vein that the Congress had failed to provide health cards to humans. ""Though the Raman Singh government is in power in the state for the last 15 years, it got the actual opportunity to work for the welfare of the state after the NDA government came to power at the Centre in 2014. Raman Singh had to fight for the rights of the state with the Congress government at the Centre,"" he told the gathering. Modi said Singh had sought support from the Centre, when it was under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance's (UPA) rule, to fight Maoists, but the ""remote controlled"" government behaved as if Chhattisgarh did not exist. He added that if the BJP government under Singh remained in power for another 10-15 years, Chhattisgarh would feature among the top three developed states in the country. ""Chhattisgarh has turned 18 now. This is a very crucial phase for the state. Just like parents care for the future of their children when they turn 18, I urge the people of the state to think about the welfare of the state and once again give Raman Singh a chance to serve,"" the prime minister told the crowd. The final phase of the Chhattisgarh polls, covering 72 Assembly seats, will be held on 20 November. The first phase of polling for 18 seats was held on 12 November.

Press Trust of India," BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday said the Congress had become more of a family enterprise aimed at dynastic service than a political party aimed at public service, taking aims at the Opposition party after Prime Minister Narendra Modi dared it to appoint a head from outside the Gandhi family. In a dig at Congress leaders, including P Chidambaram who had named several party presidents hailing from outside the Gandhi family, Shah said in tweets that Modi's challenge had ruffled several feathers with ""many courtiers going out of the way to prove their loyalty"". Evidently, the prime minister's point had struck a raw nerve, he added. At a poll rally in Chhattisgarh on Friday, Modi had said if the the Congress appointed someone who was not from the (Gandhi) family as its president for at least five years, then he would believe that Jawaharlal Nehru had indeed put in place a truly democratic system in the opposition party. ""The Prime Minister is right. The Congress (Indira) since its inception in 1978 has been led by four members of one family for most of the years, thus making it more of a family enterprise aimed at dynastic service rather than a political party aimed at public service,"" Shah  . He was referring to the split in the Congress in 1978 following its loss in the 1977 parliamentary polls, with the Indira Gandhi-led faction recognised as Congress(I). As she returned to power in 1980, her faction was later recognised by the Election Commission (EC) as the real Congress. Two Congress chiefs, who were not from the Nehru-Gandhi family, were treated in the ""most shabby"" manner possible in the recent past, Shah alleged. While PV Narasimha Rao's body, after his demise, was never allowed inside the Congress office, Sitaram Kesri, a towering leader, was ""roughed up by goons loyal to we know who"", he added. Modi, at a rally in Chhattisgarh Sunday, also alleged that Kesri was not allowed to complete his term as the Congress chief and was forced to make way for Sonia Gandhi. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president cited the examples of several ""non-family"" Congress presidents to back his claim. ""Going further back in time, the likes of Babu Jagjivan Ram, S Nijalingappa, K Kamaraj were humiliated by one family. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, though senior, was not allowed to be president by one family. UN Dhebar was asked to step aside as Congress president for Mrs Indira Gandhi,"" he said. Shah claimed that Acharya Kripalani, a stalwart who worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was ""humiliated"" through the 1950s and 1960s. ""His crime — he moved the first motion of no-confidence against the Nehru government,"" he said.

FP Politics,"Sonia Gandhi will visit Hyderabad on 23 November to campaign for the Congress ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Telangana. Sonia is expected to land in the state at the Begumpet airport by a special aircraft at around 5 pm on Friday. The UPA chairperson will then visit the Medchal constituency meeting venue where she will address a public meeting. Congress leaders in Telangana were keen that Sonia should campaign in Gajwel, which is TRS chief and caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's home turf. However, the central leadership felt that she should campaign in areas where the party is strong and can further improve its chances with her rallies. The Congress' decision to keep Sonia out of KCR's home turf could also be a sign of the party backing off and anticipating that KCR may attack it for taking credit for forming Telangana. While it was under Sonia'a leadership that the Congress Working Committee had agreed to the creation of a separate state of Telangana, KCR has been invoking Telangana pride in the course of the election campaign. The Congress is currently in a 'grand' alliance with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is led by N Chandrababu Naidu. Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and Communist Party of India (CPI) are the other members of the alliance. Lately, Naidu has been at the forefront of creating a united anti-BJP front by meeting various Opposition leaders. After Sonia, Rahul will also campaign in the state from 28 to 29 November and again on 3 December. However, Telangana Congress leaders want to make sure that Sonia addresses public meetings in both north and south Telangana.

The Congress is claiming that the people of the state know that it was Sonia who fulfilled their decade-long dream of statehood for Telangana. The party feels that the rural voters, especially the women and youth, feel let down by the TRS government, and will thus identify themselves with its campaign. Thus for the Congress, ""vote for Sonia Gandhi"" — who made the Telangana dream come true — is a major poll slogan.

At a meeting of the party's parliamentary board chaired by National President SM Asif, it was felt that fielding candidates may result in a division of secular votes. So, the party decided to extend support to the Congress. The AIMF chief appealed to the voters to defeat ""fundamentalist and communal forces"". The party underlined that minorities, SCs, STs and OBCs had suffered the most under the BJP government. It also cautioned the members of the SC and ST communities against the designs of the BJP that was aiming at splitting SC and ST votes in the reserved constituencies.

Y Maheswara Reddy," Telangana's long-brewing Adivasi-Lambada conflict is likely to impact the election outcome of 10 constituencies reserved for Scheduled Tribes (STs). The state is gearing up for Assembly polls on 7 December. The two communities have been locked in a battle for government benefits ever since the inclusion of the nomadic Lambadas, or Banjaras as they are known, in the ST list in 1976 by the undivided Andhra Pradesh government. The addition was made via an ordinance. The Adivasis have been insisting that the migratory Lambadas do not qualify as ST because the process of their inclusion was left incomplete, and also alleging that the listing of the group has deprived their own community of jobs, quotas and other opportunities. According to the 2011 Census, Telangana had 22 lakh Lambadas and 9.5 lakh Adivasis. In October and November of 2017,   between the two communities came to the fore when the   for two days outside the Adilabad District Collector’s office. The conflict took a violent turn when the two groups attacked each other's villages in Adilabad. Adivasi parents further refused to send their children to schools where Lambada teachers worked. Things came to such a pass that the police had to issue a gag order prohibiting the publishing and transmitting of information, and also suspended internet services in Asifabad, Adilabad and Nirmal districts. Now, the Adivasis are planning to take the fight to the upcoming state polls, by challenging the Lambadas in their traditional stronghold of Khanapur. In the previous election of 2014, six of the 10 ST seats — Asifabad, Khanapur, Boath in Adilabad district; Wyra, Aswaraopet, Yellendu, Bhadrachalam, Pinapaka in Khammam district; and Mahabubabad and Mulug in Warangal district — were won by the ruling TRS. In the intervening years, Opposition party legislators from three other constituencies defected to the TRS, thus increasing the party's tally to nine. One of the seats, Bhadrachalam, was won by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate. In Khanapur this time, the Adivasis have openly declared their support for the BJP candidate after the Congress fielded a Lambada candidate, Ramesh Rathod, despite the tribals' protests. BJP's man is Adivasi Satla Ashok, while the TRS has given the ticket to its sitting legislator Ajmeera Rekha Naik, again a Lambada. The conflict between the Adivasis and Lambadas will have a decisive impact on at least three constituencies reserved for the STs. ""Adivasi voters are in considerable numbers in Asifabad, Khanapur and Boath. TRS candidates can win on seven of the constituencies. Others can share the rest. While the Adivasis are in favour of the BJP, the Lambadas are set to support Congress candidates. They are angry over the TRS government's failure to provide security when the Adivasis attacked them last year,"" says BJP ST Morcha (Maharashtra) convener Amar Singh Tilawat, a Lambada from Komaram Bheem in Asifabad district. He has his own doubts about the success of BJP candidate Satla Ashok from Khanapur, since the BJP took time to announce his name while the Congress and TRS were quick in not only selecting candidates, but also in reaching out to voters for support. ""Although the Adivasis have extended their support to the BJP candidate, the outcome of the election will be decided on the basis of the money spent by the other candidates,"" Tilawat explains. Adivasi students have, meanwhile, decided to field candidates of their community on all ST constituencies to create awareness among voters over what they call the “false claim” (ST status) of the Lambada tribe. ""We have already filed a case in court against the inclusion of Lambadas into the ST category. We will demand that the Election Commission produce caste certificates of Lambada candidates. We have already written to the commission officials in these constituencies asking them to reject the nomination papers of Lambada candidates since they are not eligible to avail the benefits meant for STs. We will submit the proof given by the Election Commission in court,"" says Andhra Pradesh/Telangana Adivasi Students’ Union president Arunkumar. According to him, the government order that included the Lambada community in the ST category ""was valid for six months and limited to education and other facilities, but was not meant for government jobs and for contesting the elections from reserved constituencies"". While both communities remain at loggerheads, neither the TRS government in Telangana nor the major political parties have issued statements supporting or opposing either the Adivasis or Lambadas. Electoral compulsions have forced them not to take sides in the conflict. ""The political parties seek our votes, but do not want to support us. It was quite surprising to see the parties remain silent while we were staging protests demanding exclusion of the Lambadas,"" complains Vedma Bojju, state general secretary of the Adivasi Students’ Union, adding that ""we have decided to support those parties that are ready to support our demands"". Bojju also points out that the tribal agitation had provided the community an opportunity to convert the stir into a political movement, but the announcement of early polls in Telangana played spoilsport. But, he added, they are not disappointed. ""We are expecting the rejection of Lambada candidates' nomination papers. We demand that the Election Commission produce caste certificates of candidates. How can the Lambada community, which is a Backward Class community in neighbouring Maharashtra, become an ST community in Telangana. Our agitation will certainly have an impact,"" he says. In case the Election Commission ignores the demand, the Adivasis plan to fight against the Lambadas in court even if the candidates get elected to the state Assembly. “They can fool or cheat the commission officials but not the court,” Bojju insists. Eesam Sudhakar, an Adivasi student leader, has filed nomination papers as an Independent candidate from Mahababubabad constituency in Warangal district. ""My aim is to put up a strong fight against the Lambada candidates and create awareness among Adivasis. We will support those parties that promise the exclusion of Lambadas from the list of STs,"" Sudhakar says. But members of the Lambada community are optimistic for their own reasons. “There will be no impact of the Adivasi-Lambada conflict in Wyra constituency. I am getting more support from Adivasi voters than Lambada voters here,"" says TRS’ Lambada candidate for Wyra, Banoth Madan Lal.

Asian News International," Stepping up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has challenged the former to participate in a debate over the details of the Rafale fighter jets deal signed with the French government. Speaking to the media in Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh on Saturday, Rahul claimed that Modi will not be in a position to answer his questions over the alleged scam. ""I challenge Modi ji to come on stage anywhere, anytime and debate on Rafale with me for just 15 minutes. I will talk about Anil Ambani, HAL, the (former) French President's statements and the pricing of the jets. I will say that the defence minister said clearly that it's the prime minister who did it.

Reiterating his claim, the Congress chief said that Modi's demonetisation drive benefited only a few of his ""businessmen friends"" in the country. Talking about the unemployment crisis ensuing in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, Rahul said the incumbent chief minister, Raman Singh, had failed to provide employment in the state despite ruling it for 15 years. ""Raman Singh has been in power for the last 15 years and Prime Minister Modi has completed four and a half years in government at the Centre, and both governments have failed to fulfill their promise to generate employment opportunities for the youth,"" he said.

""After Congress comes to power, government job vacancies will be filled, and it will also stop the practice of outsourcing of jobs, which is being done in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh,"" he added. Rahul also promised that within 10 days after coming into power, the Congress will waive off the loans of Chhattisgarh's farmers. ""Secondly, you all were told that you will get a bonus.

Parth MN,"Leader of the Opposition in Chhattisgarh Assembly, TS Singh Deo, in an interview discussed Congress’ policy regarding tribals in the upcoming Assembly election. MLA from Ambikapur constituency since 2008, Deo is touted as one of the frontrunners to be the chief ministerial picks if Congress comes to power. In a detailed conversation with Parth MN, Deo spoke about the need to improve the standard of living of tribals. He criticised the Raman Singh government for prioritising corporate interests over tribals, alleging that the BJP-led government has neglected their interests, which has resulted in an economic mismatch in Chhattisgarh. Popularly known as TS Baba, Deo, who belongs to the royal family, condemned the arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, who has lived in Chhattisgarh almost all her life. Tribals form about 31 percent of the population in Chhattisgarh. Their population has reduced by 1 percent in the last census. They live mostly in jungle areas, which is less productive as far as the agriculture is concerned. So the main concern for their development is to provide them with means of livelihood other than agriculture. Their natural habitat is the forest. So, one could be forest produce, two could be tourism, third could be handicrafts, fourth could be their rights in mining areas which they have been denied, and government jobs. The idea is to provide a better standard of living. If you make a road, it is of no consequence unless it improves your standard of living. If you make a school, it is of no use unless it improves the standard of living. It's important for them to make the best of the environment they live in. If you are bringing in industry and it is not providing jobs to them, if you are doing mining activity and they don’t have any share of it, it is of no consequence. For example, in Kondagaon, they told me there are around 70,000-80,000 people engaged in cottage industry where they make gun metal statues. I met the workers during the process of making the people’s manifesto. And one could see very easily where they are falling behind. There are middlemen who help the tribal with the raw material, and for their profit margins to be higher, they sell the finished good at a price lower than the market price. The tribals complained regarding the handicraft corporation which has been formed. There, too, it is a matter of commission mongering. There is a large market for such products, which are of interest and value to the people within the country and even to export markets. Unfortunately, no government has thought of pushing them in a big way. The survey was not done in 100 villages, so it could mean that 500 people in a village on an average, which is 50,000. It is not a small number. Several groups are migrating because of pressure from the Naxals and lack of employment in the state, among other things. Other reason could also be the rise in the number of people coming from outside the state. Reasons behind falling percent in the number of tribals in the state are mostly migration out of tribal areas and migration into Chhattisgarh. There is no proof to conclude that drop in birth rate is the reason. It is basically neglect. There is a sense of complacency in the current government — no matter what happens, we win. There is a lot of bureaucracy in the ruling government and Raman Singh is completely dependent on that. So long as they are delivering him a government, election after election, Raman Singh has left Chhattisgarh to be managed by the bureaucrats. Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of BPL families in the country. At least, 39.93 percent is the reserve bank figure for average BPL families – urban and rural combined – for Chhattisgarh. It is the highest in the country. For a state that is supposed to be developing, something is going wrong. If the per capita income has crossed 90,000 and your family is an average of 4.53. By that calculation a family in Chhattisgarh should earn 4.5 lakh rupees. Tribals aren't earning even close to it. It basically indicates that a few people are earning a lot and the tribals are marginalised. If you are able to project the per capita is increasing, where is the money going? Whether they are tribals or non-tribals, so long as they are residents of Chhattisgarh, you should target those reserves that displace the least. Secondly, if you are saying that in the next coming years, you are going to change the technology to non-traditional means of production of electricity, that is non-coal based electricity, you are not going to need coal. If you don’t need all of this coal, where does it reside? If this coal resides in tribal areas only, then you don’t have an option. But if there is coal in non-tribal areas, where the land could be more expensive, then the government is duty bound not to help the industry by getting cheaper land, which is forest and tribal land, in comparison to the land that may be more expensive but lie in non-tribal areas. Don't allot it to them. Yes, if you have the will. Lemru is an area between Surguja and Korba. It is a forest area of 450 square kilometers. This government had itself projected it as an elephant reserve. The UPA government had approved it. After the approval, Raman Singh government stalled it because they wanted to give it for mining. In our manifesto, we have included that areas like Lemru would be de-reserved for coal block allocation. The section of society that is most opposed to land being taken over are the women. They are most opposed to being uprooted. Because, socially, they are the most affected and they are also the most exploited lot — their lifestyle changes completely. They feel alientated. Then you have the male members, who go by how much will they get and what will they get. Then there is the youth — after studying and switching over to wearing jeans, how many would like to till the land? They are looking for a different way of life. It is influenced by what they see on TV, or when they go to cities. Yes. The youth is not averse to land being taken. Yet, the rights of the landowners should have priority. The new land acquisition act requires 70-80 percent of the landowners. We change that by governing better. We would like to believe that we are the kind of team that changes that. When people use force to get power, then people will be seen standing behind whoever is in power and dominant. Historically, entire population never rebels. Eventually, the tendency is to accept whoever is stronger. In the Naxal area, whoever is seen to be stronger, will be able to subdue the population. The question is do people want to be with the Naxals or do they stand with the State? They would just want to be free. They do not like any pressure from anybody in their day to day lives. Basic nature of a tribal is independence. Among the Adivasis, discontent begins when they are falsely accused of being Naxals, jailed for three-four years and then let off over lack of evidence. Secondly, if Naxals or other organisations, that have the means to be dominant in that area, and are able to have their presence felt, why would people be listening to them? Either it is genuine support, where people feel the Constitution is a piece of paper worth nothing. I don’t think that's what the people of Chhattisgarh think. Those villagers, who aren't fully educated, don't understand the matters of state or Constitution. It is a matter of making your dominance in an area through the ideology that you purport to believe in, using force to create dominance, and using people either as supporters – genuine or under pressure – or because you want to use them as shields. The informer is the target number one, not the exploiter. Had the exploiter been the target, we would have felt they are ideologically inclined. I have met her on a number of occasions. And she is a committed lady. Committed to the cause of those in need. She has given up better options in her career. The government does not have proof, and it is just trying to create pressure because somebody doesn’t agree with what they are saying. No state organisation can make false charges against people to make their ends meet. She is an honest woman of high morale and ethical values. These are the people we need.

Press Trust of India," TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao will renew efforts to forge a non-NDA, non-UPA front after the Telangana Assembly election, a key party leader said on Monday. KT Rama Rao, the son of caretaker chief minister Chandrasekhar Rao, also took an aim at N Chandrababu Naidu for his attempts to bring together Opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""Desperate times, they say, call for desperate measures,"" is how Rama Rao termed the efforts of Naidu, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister. In an interview to  , Rama Rao — KTR as he is referred to by many — alleged that Naidu was desperate because he was in a bad shape politically in his home state, where the Assembly election is due in 2019. ""He (Naidu) is trying to shift the blame of his failure of governance on to the central government. He wants to give an impression that he is fighting against (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi"", KTR said. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader said Naidu wants to paint Modi as a ""villain"" of this region, but KTR pointed out that Modi and the BJP were a ""non-entity"" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. ""It shows his (Naidu's) level of frustration,"" KTR said, describing the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president's moves to forge Opposition unity against the BJP as part of a cover-up for his ""failure"" as the chief minister. Naidu had recently met Congress president Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda and DMK head MK Stalin, among others, as part of his efforts. Earlier, KCR had also met TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and Deve Gowda, among others, to prop up a non-Congress, non-BJP front. On a perception in some quarters that Chandrasekhar Rao's efforts on this front have failed, KTR said the aim of the TRS was not to garner power by forging opportunistic alliances. After 11 December, when the Assembly polls results will be declared, KTR asserted that Chandrasekhar Rao would come back as the chief minister and renew steps to build such a front. ""Our efforts to build a non-NDA, a non-UPA coalition will continue because it's in the larger interest of the country,"" Rama Rao said, alleging that both the Congress and the BJP had failed the country. In a federal set-up, states need to be empowered, he said. ""Our efforts are not to form a ' ' government based on opportunistic alliances.

Rajbhar, a state minister, has often been critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and policies of its governments at the Centre and in the state.

In the folklore, a woman used to head towards her paternal home after frequent tiff with her husband, while her in-laws and others used to placate her. Later, the village decided that no one will try to placate her. After she moved out of the village, she caught hold of a goat and started crying that even it was not stopping her from leaving her in-laws' place.

Press Trust of India," Rajasthan's Tonk assembly constituency is set to witness an interesting poll fight between Congress state unit chief Sachin Pilot and the BJP's sitting MLA Ajit Singh Mehta. The northern state will go to polls on  7 December. Mehta had won the seat, which has a sizeable number of Muslim voters, in the 2013 Assembly elections with a margin of over 30,000 votes. ""I am fully confident of retaining my seat. I am not under any fear or pressure. My supporters and party workers are quite excited about the poll battle with Pilot,"" the 53-year-old BJP leader told  . Mehta, who filed his nomination papers on Thursday, said developmental works worth Rs 2,000 crore were executed in the last five years in the state.

New grid sub stations were installed, while a water pipeline was laid in Tonk to address water issues,"" he said. The BJP MLA said he was a ""local"" and Pilot was an ""outsider"" for Tonk. The Congress, meanwhile, is eyeing the assembly seats in eastern parts of the state with Pilot's nomination. Pilot is also seen as the party's chief ministerial candidate. Apart from Jaipur, Tonk district touches boundary with Ajmer (eight seats), Sawaimadhopur (four seats), Dausa five seats), Bhilwara (seven seats) and Bundi (three seats). ""Tonk is a good seat for me to contest which touches Ajmer and Dausa. Since I announced to contest the elections, there were requests from 13 to 14 districts and the party decided Tonk. We will win significant number of seats in the entire Rajasthan and particularly in the eastern parts,"" Pilot, 41, said. ""The party workers have worked hard not only in this region, but in the entire state and the result of the election will make this clear. Not only Tonk, the party is going to win majority of seats in Rajasthan,"" he said.

""We are bringing a   and not a   like the BJP. Our document of promises has something for everybody,"" the former Union minister said. Here's a look at what the grand old party has promised the voters of Madhya Pradesh for the coming five years if it is elected to power: 1. It has promised to write off farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh and provide a ""salary grant"" for five years to industries offering jobs to the youth. 2. The party has promised a social security pension to the farmers and a rebate in the registration fee of land documents, besides a financial help of Rs 51,000 for the marriage of daughters of small cultivators. It has also promised a minimum support price (MSP) for crops in accordance with the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations, along with a promise of providing social security pension of Rs 1,000 per month to farmers who attain the age of 60 and whose land holding is below 2.5 acres. Besides this, a provision for an amount of Rs 2.50 lakh for the construction of houses of landless people on a plot of 450 square feet has also been mentioned in the manifesto. 3. Other sops promised to farmers include a 50 percent subsidy on loans for agriculture equipment, halving the power bill rates for them, a bonus on the MSP of around 17 crops or agricultural commodities and a subsidy of Rs 5 per litre on milk procurement. The manifesto also promises a rebate in diesel and petrol prices. A subsidy of Rs 100 on gas cylinders to poor families and free education to girls up to the post-graduation level were also promised by the party. 4. The Opposition party has also promised a re-investigation into the   incident, in which six farmers were killed in June 2017. 5. It proposes to bring a law to give housing rights to the people, as well as 35 kilograms of wheat and rice at Re 1/kg to the poor. It has also proposed to set up a ' ' or the legislative council in a bicameral system. 6. The Congress has also promised a ""salary grant"" of Rs 10,000 per job to the industries offering employment to the youth of the state. Professionals like tourist guides and lawyers would be provided an ""encouragement fee"" of Rs 4,000 per month for five years for settling down in their respective professions. Those covered under the existing social security pension scheme would get Rs 1,000 per month, instead of Rs 300 now. 7.

It has promised the constitution of a Yuva Aayog (Commission for the Youth) to look into the problems of young men and women. 10. In a bid to appease members of the general category, which has been agitating over perceived injustice to them, the Opposition party has promised the constitution of a Samanya Varg Ayog (General Category Commission) to look into their issues. 
The state had recently seen a series of protests by people from the unreserved (general) category communities. 11. A Jan Aayog (People's Commission) would be constituted for investigations into scams like Vyapam. A ""  (public accountability law) would be enacted to hold the government departments responsible for providing public amenities, Kamal Nath announced on Saturday. The party has thus promised to disband the Vyapam and replace it with a ""Rajya Karmachari Chayan Aayog"" to ensure transparent recruitments and a corruption-free system. It will also refund the examination fees of the lakhs of youth who had appeared for the recruitment tests conducted by the board in the last 10 years. 12. The party has promised laptops for Class XII students obtaining over 70 percent marks and subsidised two-wheeler loans for female college students. 13.

The party said it would develop religious places along the river at a cost of Rs 1,100 crore, besides enacting the "" "" for its conservation. The river has been at the centre of the state's politics for a long time now, with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party organising a "" "" earlier and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh carrying out a 3,500-kilometre ' ' (circumambulation) of the river by foot. 14.

Aakar Patel,"One of the sharpest talents of our prime minister is how he can frame an argument. He seems to bring something fresh and convincing when he takes up an ordinary subject. This week he responded to the Congress claim that he became prime minister only because of the system that Jawaharlal Nehru put in place. His response was to say: ""I want to challenge them... let some good leader of Congress outside the Gandhi family become the party president for only five years, then I will say that Nehruji really created a truly democratic system."" One answer to that is that there was, of course, a non-Gandhi person who was president for five years and that was PV Narasimha Rao, who was also the ninth Prime Minister of India. And after him, though for a shorter period, Sitaram Kesri was the Congress president. But the real point is that Narendra Modi is right: the Congress is like a private limited company, where all the shares are held by one family. The Bharatiya Janata Party is like a public limited company where the stakes are shared among a much wider group of people, and where merit is more important than family ties. You can fail often and still remain the head of the Congress if you are a Gandhi. There is no pressure on him to perform. On the other hand, if Modi does not lead his party to a decisive win in 2019, he will immediately face dissent and a challenge from inside the party. This is how it happens in all healthy political parties in a democratic framework. And so what Modi has said about Congress is a fact, and it cannot be disputed. The question is whether his challenge or advice is worth following for the Congress as a party. I think it is. And I do not think it needs to be exactly what Modi says, which is to say give up the party presidency. Even if Rahul Gandhi says he has no intention of becoming the prime minister, he will bring a credibility to himself and his party. The Congress currently lacks credibility among large parts of the population. Sacrifice is one of the most powerful symbols in our society and someone who gives up power and possessions, as Mahatma Gandhi did, is automatically elevated in the public imagination. Sonia Gandhi was able to transform her image in 2004, when she said the same thing after defeating the BJP. Those of us who are old enough to remember that time well, will know how different her image was before that moment. The current Congress president has often said that, for him, the political battle is about the kind of India that Hindutva is producing. He fears for the future because of the hatred and violence that is being perpetuated, and wants better for his country. This is an admirable thing to say. But if a change in the direction the country is headed is the main thing that Rahul is seeking, he should have no problem in setting his personal ambitions aside. At least for this election, if not forever. There is no lack of highly competent people in the Congress to run things, in the event, however unlikely it may seem at the moment, they will manage to win the election. In fact, it will help the Congress build an alliance if they approach other parties without personal ambition. It will bring great credibility to their idea of a national front if they say that the Gandhis are not interested in the office of power. There will be an instant and positive change in the way Rahul is perceived by millions of Indians if he says he is not a candidate for prime minister. And it will help his party also, because it will increase the stakes for outsiders, who will feel motivated to invest more time and effort and money in the party. It will become more of a public limited company and its long term future will become more secure. I am not for one moment saying anything because there are issues with Rahul. I have never met him and he could well have it in him to be a good or great leader. Certainly, he has the right to run for whatever office he wants to because we are a democracy. What I am saying is that Rahul should consider what Modi said positively. He should assess whether he helps his cause and his party in taking up that challenge. I think he does. Of course, we must accept that the Gandhi family has sacrificed more for this nation than the leadership of any political party. Two of their leaders have been assassinated and for the family to remain in politics must take great courage and determination. They deserve respect, which they do not always get. They are abused casually and easily by people like Modi without acknowledging what they have suffered. Would their prestige be restored by another act of sacrifice and renunciation? I think it would.",2018-11-18,"BJP,Congress,Congress President,Gandhi Family,Hindutva,InMyOpinion,Jawaharlal Nehru,Narendra Modi,Non-Gandhi Congress President,One-Family Rule,Rahul Gandhi,Sonia Gandhi",Rahul Gandhi should take PM's criticism positively; renouncing claim on chair could restore credibility,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-should-take-pms-criticism-positively-renouncing-claim-on-chair-could-restore-credibility-5570561.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has withdrawn the ‘general’ consent given by his government to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to undertake operations in his state. Since law and order is a state subject, it appears it is well within his jurisdiction to revoke permission. What applies to the CBI also seems to apply to other investigating agencies under the control of the central government. This means that under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, which governs the CBI’s functioning, the investigating agency will have to seek permission from the state government every time it wants to undertake an operation, including searches and seizures, unless it arms itself with an order from a high court or the Supreme Court. Existing probes will also not be affected. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is singing from the same hymn sheet. Though she has backed Naidu’s decision, the position, as far as her government and state are concerned, seems to be somewhat unclear. Some reports suggest that Bengal has already followed Naidu in shutting the CBI out, while others say that Banerjee’s government is exploring legal options. It has also been suggested that Bengal stopped issuing the required ‘general’ consent in 1989, which could mean that Banerjee may now use its powers more stringently to block the CBI. In effect, the outcome will be the same – the CBI and other agencies will not have a free investigative run in Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. This will obviously affect interstate probes or those that require multi-agency cooperation and the resources that the central agencies alone command. This is pretty bad news for law-enforcement in a general sense. But the issues underlying this situation are possibly graver. With the precedent, already set, being reinforced in this manner, it will now be open to any state government to deny or withdraw permission to the CBI and others whenever it chooses to, especially when it has political problems with the party or alliance in power in Delhi. This has the potential in itself of proving to be an obstacle in the smooth functioning of the federal order. And, of course, there are no guarantees that this issue will remain confined to the arena of law enforcement. In fact, the kind of rhetoric that has already begun to fly around is suggestive of an overheated polity in which there is a strong possibility that some kind of escalation will occur. The critical question is: Who is to blame for the current contretemps? It is necessary to answer this question, not just for the academic satisfaction of apportioning responsibility, but also because the answer might show the political class how to resolve the mess. Naidu and Banerjee have made two substantive points: first, the CBI had been converted into a tool of political blackmail by the regime headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi; and, second, the CBI had lost all credibility as an investigating agency following the well-publicised battle between its two top officers, which has landed up for adjudication in the Supreme Court. They may well have added that the central government’s insalubrious conduct in trying to contain the damage only made matters worse. The BJP’s position was articulated by GVL Narasimha Rao, who opined that the recent happenings within the CBI had been used as a ""ruse to brazenly save the corrupt and extend political patronage to people and organisations involved in acts of corruption"". So, which position is more reflective of the reality of the current political situation? To begin with, it has to be noted that Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party was a member of the National Democratic Alliance, in other words a BJP coalition partner, till nine moths ago, almost to the day. That is to say, the central government run by the BJP found no reason to probe their allies or the ‘friends’ of their allies for its first four years in government. It was only when Naidu left the alliance did the government suddenly feel the need to initiate wide-ranging investigations. Rao’s self-righteous rhetoric stands exposed immediately, therefore, for what it is: a self-serving, and risible, attempt to promote his party as the keeper of the flame. This could have held some water if the BJP government in Delhi had made some kind of effort to investigate those accused of corruption in the Rafale case. Without a smidgen of doubt, a   case existed for an inquiry both by the CBI and under the auspices of a joint parliamentary committee. Neither was conceded. The conclusion that the   warriors against corruption have sack loads to hide is not difficult to reach. The same applies to the sudden decision on part of the Union government to reveal the pricing aspects of the deal secretly to the Supreme Court to avoid having to make a full public disclosure. It is true that the Modi government has consistently used the CBI and other investigative agencies to undermine political opponents. It can hardly be said that the BJP invented this strategy. Practically every government in Delhi has been guilty of doing pretty much the same thing. There is, however, a matter of degree. The BJP has been doing this with an unvarying consistency for the past four-and-a-half years. It has taken the art of political vendetta and the use of government agencies for the party’s political and electoral objectives to a different level, which changes the qualitative character of these strategies. Read this alongside the Modi government’s relentless subversion of all manner of institutions and what you have on your plate is a mess in which a federal system cannot function smoothly. In fact, there is every reason to believe that if the next government, to be elected next year, continues to run the course set by the current dispensation, forget federalism, constitutional democracy itself could be critically compromised. Thus, if we have to assign blame, a huge chunk will have to be borne by the BJP and the Modi government. Naidu and Banerjee may have embarked on a course of action fraught with dangerous possibilities, but there can be no denying that they were almost forced to seek desperate remedies. That having been said, it is now necessary to recalibrate procedures to resolve the current situation. Consensus will have to play a major role in bringing about serious change. The old demand for making the CBI (and other agencies) autonomous to free it of partisan control is also worth seriously considering. Given the realities of India’s fractured and broken political system, and the fact that the central government is run by a party that values self-aggrandisement above everything else, you’d be well advised, however, not to hold your breath waiting for substantive change.",2018-11-17,"BJP,CBI,CBI Vs CBI,India,Mamata Banerjee,N.

Rahul Singh Shekhawat," The Congress and BJP are said to be fearful of rising resentment amongst their party cadre, after releasing their candidate lists for  , to be held on 18 November. Naresh Bansal, BJP Uttarakhand general secretary, has suspended 64 party leaders for a period of six years, saying that there is no place for such leaders who are against the party. Similarly, senior Congress leader Suryakant Dhasmana, says that the party’s discipline committee met with district committees and so far, 56 party members have been suspended on disciplinary grounds from the party. Although both the Congress and BJP have taken disciplinary action against their leaders for going against their respective parties, the fear of party members turning into rebel candidates plagues them. The civic polls are being held just six months before the general election in 2019, and will reflect the mood of voters residing in urban areas. For both chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and PCC president Pritam Singh, the results of the civic polls will be a crucial deciding factor for 2019; a loss would be a major question on leadership. The BJP is facing pressure to retain all its seats, after having won four out of six seats in the previous election. At the time, the other two seats were won by its rebel leaders — Yashpal Rana in Rudki and Usha Chaudhary in Kashipur. The Congress, now, is trying hard to regain its lost ground for the municipal corporation elections. After releasing the list of candidates for the civic elections, the chief minister faces a challenge within his own constituency, Doiwala. Party leader Madhu Dobhal has rebelled, and has now filed his nomination as an Independent candidate for the seat. Noticeably, Uttarakhand Assembly speaker Premchand Agarwal and state BJP president Ajay Bhatt entered into a heated argument at Jolly Grant airport a few days ago, over selecting a candidate for the mayor’s seat in Rishikesh municipal corporation. According to sources, Agarwal was not consulted for the selection of the candidate, despite being the MLA of the Rishikesh constituency. Kusum Kandwal, a senior leader from the BJP filed her nomination as an Independent candidate after being snubbed by the party, which fielded Anita Mamgain for the Rishikesh seat. However, after discussions with the senior leadership, she withdrew her nomination. The Kotdwara municipal corporation seat is a bone of contention as well. While the Congress has fielded Hemlata Negi, BJP members like Sashi Nainwal, Vibha Chauhan and Sudha Sati have rebelled, and filed their nominations as independent candidates for Kotdwara. The ruling party seems to be in denial. BJP’s state in-charge, Shyam Jaju says, “There is no chance of party leaders turning rebel, as most of the leaders who were upset with the candidate selection, have now been convinced. Action has been taken against those who were against the party.” It will be interesting to look at the contest for the highly coveted Dehradun municipal corporation seat. This is because Dehradun, apart from being the state capital, also has the oldest and largest municipal corporation, from where the BJP has won twice consecutively in the past two elections. The chief minister picked Sunil Uniyal Gama for the seat, who will be contesting against former Congress cabinet minister Dinesh Agarwal and Rajni Rawat, a transgender woman from the Aam Aadmi Party. Things aren’t any better in the Congress camp; they have been facing a tough time regaining lost ground in Uttarakhand, as multiple leaders from the party have filed their nominations as Independent candidates. In Haldwani, Lalit Joshi filed his nomination as an Independent candidate, after the Congress fielded Sumit Hridyesh for the seat. Joshi, after holding discussions with senior party leaders later, withdrew his nominations. Strangely, the Congress camp hasn’t been actively campaigning, despite the presence of senior leaders like former president Kishore Upadhyay, Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Tamta and former Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal. Kishore Upadhyay says that he has not received any direction or order from the PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee), and that he has been campaigning on his own. Anugrah Narayan Singh, AICC in-charge Uttarakhand, says, “Minor differences are there in every party, and after visiting Kumaon Garhwal and other places, I can say that people are not happy with the BJP, and this time the Congress will win the civic elections.” Political commentator Surendra Singh Arya, says politicians who contest for the positions of mayor or chairman in municipal corporations, eventually go further and contest at the state Vidhan Sabha level as well. He remarks, “Many bigwigs in the state have come through the panchayat system, which is why the infighting in parties increases during ticket distribution.” Many established leaders from both Congress and BJP first held positions at the civic level. State finance minister Prakash Pant had been a member of the Pithoragarh municipality, while education minister Arvind Pandey was the chairman of the Bajpur municipality. In the Congress, Sarita Arya, former MLA and present state president of Mahila Congress Uttarakhand, was also chairman in the Nainital municipality. Campaigning for the municipal corporation elections ended on 16 November, and 24 lakh citizens are eligible to vote on 18 November.",2018-11-17,"BJP,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Dehradun,Pritam Singh,Trivendra Singh Rawat,Uttarakhand,Uttarakhand Civic Polls","Uttarakhand civic polls tomorrow: BJP, Congress struggle to contain intra-party divisions; rebel leaders pose challenge",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/uttarakhand-civic-polls-tomorrow-bjp-congress-struggle-to-contain-intra-party-divisions-rebel-leaders-pose-challenge-5569061.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The Congress demanded on Saturday that Goa governor Mridula Sinha summon a special session of the legislative Assembly and ask the BJP-led coalition government to prove its majority. The Opposition party, which has been claiming that the state government is in disarray in the absence of ailing Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar from office, alleged that it ""is a classic case of fraud being played on the people of Goa by the Governor and the BJP at the Centre"". Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters in Panaji that the party would raise this issue during the upcoming winter session of Parliament and also before President Ram Nath Kovind. The Congress had submitted representations to the president and the Goa governor, claiming that the party had the requisite number of MLAs to prove majority in the 40-member House. ""We will put pressure on the central leadership of the BJP in winter session and also before the President for our demand to summon a special session to prove majority,"" he said. Accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Goa of holding the Constitution ""captive"", Surjewala said the formation of the Cabinet Advisory Committee by the BJP in absence of Parrikar is a ""blatant fraud on the Constitution"". In the 40-member Goa Assembly, the Parrikar government has the support of 23 MLAs. These comprise 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party as well as three Independents. Surjewala said the coalition government should prove its majority and lay down a roadmap for governance and administration. The government should also settle issues like Regional Plan, mining, unemployment, he demanded. ""This will clear all doubts about who is in-charge in Goa and the floor test will determine as to which party has the rightful claim to head a democratic government in people's interest in Goa,"" he added. Surjewala questioned the effectiveness of state government in absence of Parrikar, who is currently recuperating at his residence here after undergoing treatment at AIIMS in Delhi. Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that Parrikar was suffering from pancreatic cancer. Surjewala alleged, ""Constitution is being held captive because of the BJP's lust for power. Formation of a Cabinet Advisory Committee (CAC) by the BJP is a blatant fraud on the Constitution itself."" ""It negates the constitutionally conferred powers of the state cabinet under Articles 163, 164, 166."" Surjewala alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah were responsible for the ""political and administration mess"" in Goa by allowing an ailing Parrikar to continue in chair. ""Paralysed governance, crippled administration and collapse of authority has become symbolical of the chaos prevailing in the BJP government in Goa,"" he claimed. Wishing Parrikar speedy recovery, Surjewala recalled that party president Rahul Gandhi had inquired about the chief minister's health last month. ""On account of incapacity of the CM owing to his illness, power brokers are running amok and are plundering the state's resources and holding democracy to ransom,"" he alleged. Surjewala said that the BJP held a meeting of Cabinet ministers of Goa in AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Delhi on October 12, where Parrikar was undergoing treatment. ""This has never happened in the history of Goa. On October 31, 2018, the official Twitter handle of the Goa CM posted a picture of that Cabinet meeting,"" he said. ""The people of Goa were deeply disturbed by the visual in that picture. It reflects that Parrikar needs emergent medical attention rather than the grand-standing by the BJP,"" he said. He said key governance issues were being dragged due to BJP's ""misgovernance"" in Goa. ""The mess created by the BJP by stoppage of mining, closure of businesses of small traders and mismanagement of sand mining has affected the entire state,"" he claimed. The Congress had earlier questioned non-issuance of medical bulletins on health of Parrikar. ""If the CM is fine, as per the press statements, then why is he refusing to meet even the Leader of Opposition and MLAs and interact with them?"" Surjewala asked. Recently, Subhash Shirodkar and Dayanad Sopte resigned as Congress MLAs and joined the BJP, bringing down the strength of the opposition party to 14 in Goa Assembly.",2018-11-17,"BJP,Congress,Goa,India,Manohar Parrikar,Mridula Sinha,NewsTracker,Panaji,Politics",Congress asks Goa governor to summon special session of Assembly for BJP-led govt to prove majority,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-asks-goa-governor-to-summon-special-session-of-assembly-for-bjp-led-govt-to-prove-majority-5569691.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service," The Kerala unit of the BJP observed a protest on Sunday by blocking highways across the state following the arrest and the subsequent remand of senior party leader K Surendran. Surendran was taken into custody on Saturday night after he got into a scuffle with the police while attempting to go to the Sabarimala temple despite police cordon in the area. After spending the night at Chittar police station, Surendran was produced before a magistrate near Pathanamthitta on Sunday morning which remanded him to a 14-day judicial custody. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader is currently at the Kottarakkara sub-jail. Surendran who spoke to the media before being remanded said: ""The police have charged me uunder non-bailable sections. I am no criminal, nor do I have any cases against me. They did not let me sleep, nor was I allowed water or to take my medicines. ""The police even roughed up my ' ' (a mandatory holy kit to be taken to the temple)."" In reaction to the development, state BJP President PS Sreedharan Pillai told the media that Kerala was under ""jungle raj"". ""Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is arrogant and was behaving in an irrational manner. The present impasse in the state over the Sabarimala issue is his creation. We will strongly resist."" BJP leaders and activists started to block traffic across the state on the highways since 10 am. According to new police rules that came into effect from Friday, no pilgrim is allowed to proceed to the temple after 7 pm as the temple closes for the day at 10 pm. The temple opened its doors at 5 pm on Friday for two months. The temple town has witnessed protests by Hindu groups since 28 September when the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the temple that hitherto banned girls and women aged between 10 and 50. The apex court last week refused to stay its earlier verdict. Surendran and his party have been up in arms against the Vijayan government, which according to them, is determined to see that a woman in the hitherto ""banned"" age group is allowed   at the temple and they have vowed that the temple traditions will not be breached.

Press Trust of India,": BJP president Amit Shah on Friday said the Congress did not care about the nation's security when it ""ruled India for 70 years"", adding securing the borders was a major achievement of the Modi-led government. Addressing a poll rally, Shah credited the Modi government with giving impetus to boosting the country's security. ""When the Congress was in power and Manmohan Singh was the prime minister, Pakistani terrorists used to infiltrate, explode bombs and go back,"" he said. There was anger across the country after the 2016 Uri attack in which 18 Indian soldiers were killed. But this was not the regime of Mauni Baba (Manmohan Singh).

""The Congress did not care about the country's security for 70 years when it was in power, but bothered only about their vote banks. For us, security is more precious than our own lives,"" he said. Shah said the difference between the BJP and the Congress is that if one wants to become the prime minister or the president of the Congress, ""they have to take birth in the Nehru-Gandhi family while in the BJP, one can rise to the top based on abilities even after being born in a poor family"". ""An example of this is Narendra Modi, who was born in a tea seller's family but is now the prime minister.

Sanjay Singh,"On 12 August, Rahul Gandhi had told Congress workers at Ramlila Ground in Jaipur that he would not let any “parachute candidate” secure ticket in upcoming state elections and would also ensure that the maximum number of women candidates are nominated by the party to contest. “Before every election, parachute candidates come and take tickets. This time I guarantee that not one parachute candidate will get tickets. I will cut strings of parachute candidates,”  . On 8 August while speaking at Mahila Adhikaar Sammelan organised by the Congress’ women wing at New Delhi’s Talkatora stadium  , “I want to tell you all that in the future, women of India will have at least 50 percent posts in the Congress party. This will not happen overnight, but this is our aim because we are not ready to believe that if women have 50 percent population, if women contribute 50 percent to run the country, then our political organisation should also have the same space for them.” Ahead of the Karnataka elections, Rahul in February had spoken the same thing that half of the party posts and tickets will be given to women. Earlier he had proposed that Congress should shortlist candidates through a laid out process like American primary. All through August and September the Congress president in his public programmes in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh repeatedly thundered against “parachute candidates”, turncoats and rebels from other parties and raising high hopes to women ticket aspirants. But all these were conveniently forgotten when tickets to party candidates were actually distributed with his sign and seal. Turn to Madhya Pradesh for a 230-member state Assembly the Congress has given tickets to 28 women candidates, roughly 12 percent of the total number of seats. Then there were some parachute candidates who happily accepted a Congress ticket. Most prominent of them being the 78-year-old BJP leader Sartaj Singh (denied ticket due to 75-year retirement formula) who got a Congress ticket barely half-an-hour after quitting BJP and joining Congress. Rahul didn’t cut the strings of the parachute as he had promised earlier. In Chhattisgarh, for the 90-member Assembly, it gave tickets to 13 women, one less from the last Assembly elections. The situation is no better in BJP, both for the number of women candidates fielded and number of turncoats getting the party nomination. But why the Congress is being questioned here not the BJP is because its president Rahul had made tall claims on multiple occasions on various platforms. In contrast to that BJP president Amit Shah did not many any such claim. Shah had kept it straight -- winnability of a candidate as principal criteria in ticket distribution. Rahul can’t take the plea that the party he presides does not listen to him. His control over the party is supreme. Every party candidate has to present the certificate (commonly called ticket) with sign and seal of party president before the returning officer at the time of nomination. That facilitates allocation of party symbol for polling. What nine-time Lok Sabha MP Kamal Nath said on Thursday was perhaps a strong rebuttal to his party president's observations. Nath said the party did not pick up many women candidates for  or for   (decoration) making it clear that it's only winnability which decides the tickets and neither gender nor 'outsider' are factors.",2018-11-16,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chhattisgarh,Congress,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Women Candidates",Assembly polls 2018: Rahul Gandhi's promises on denying tickets to turncoats and including more women fall flat,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/assembly-polls-2018-rahul-gandhis-promises-on-denying-tickets-to-turncoats-and-including-more-women-fall-flat-5562791.html,firstpost,-1,0

Rahul Singh Shekhawat," The upcoming elections for municipality corporations in Uttarakhand have assumed hitherto unseen importance because of what is at stake for both the major parties, the Congress and the BJP. The hilly state will witness elections on 18 November for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The state is ruled by the BJP, which stormed into power by winning 57 of the 70 seats in the Assembly polls in February 2017, displacing Harish Rawat-led Congress government. For the Congress, this election is a do-or-die situation, a matter of survival. For the BJP, it's a matter of prestige as the results are slated to be viewed as the state government's referendum. Also, whisper networks are abuzz with talks that Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat's position might be in trouble if the BJP fails to do well as his detractors within the party would then find a premise to question his performance. Also, with Lok Sabha polls barely half a year away, both the parties want to get a headstart by registering a victory in these polls. Such is the importance they are according to these elections that not only former state ministers and their kin are in the fray but also current, former and prospective MLAs and MPs have been asked to throw their weight behind the party candidates in their constituency. The Congress' mayoral candidate for the state's biggest turf, Dehradun, is former sports, forests and wildlife and law and justice minister Dinesh Agrawal, who held the post between 2012 and 2017. In the second most important municipal corporation, Haldwani, the Congress' choice for mayor is the son of Indira Hridayesh, Opposition leader in the Assembly. For Pauri municipal corporation, the BJP has fielded former MLA Yashpal Benam for the post of mayor. In the newly designated municipal corporation of Kotdwar, wife of former state minister Surendra Singh Negi is the Congress' pick for the post of mayor. Ex-minister Shoorveer Singh Sajwan’s wife Ambika Sajwan, also a former district panchayat president, is contesting on Congress ticket for Tehri municipal chairperson’s post. Further, the BJP has deputed eight state ministers for campaigning. They are Higher Education Minister Dhan Singh Rawat, Transport Minister Yashpal Arya, Finance Minister Prakash Pant, Urban Development Minister Madan Kaushik, Forests and Environment Minister Harak Singh Rawat, Agriculture Minister Subodh Uniyal, Education Minister Arvind Pandey and Women & Child Welfare Minister Rekha Arya. Bhojpuri performer and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari too has been addressing rallies to attract people from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, concentrated in certain pockets of the state, especially Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. Bhatt sought to downplay the notion that the result of these elections might reflect on Rawat's future. He said it is hyperlocal issues that matter in ULB polls. He said the BJP will register a victory in three-fourths of the corporations that are going to elections. Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh is somewhat in the same boat as the chief minister as these elections will be his first major test since he got a charge of the party's state unit last year. However, he said office-bearers come and go but the party contests elections as a composite unit. He said the candidates have been chosen after consultations with district-level party functionaries and leaders. He added that the victory of Congress candidates is guaranteed as the BJP governments at the Centre and the state have failed to live up to the expectations of the people. The Congress' mayoral candidate for Dehradun, former minister Agrawal, said people of Dehradun have been itching for a change and that's why the Congress will register a victory this time. For the last two terms, it is the BJP that has been winning Dehradun corporation elections. In Agrawal, the Congress has fielded a politician who has defeated the young state's first chief minister Nityanand Swami twice in elections. Harish Rawat, the last chief minister of Uttarakhand and now the Congress' national general secretary, is among the grand old party's star campaigners. He termed the BJP a party of catchphrases and expressed confidence that the electorate will reject its gimmicks and choose the Congress owing to the welfare schemes the government had launched during his tenure.",2018-11-16,"BJP,Congress,Dinesh Agrawal,Haldwani,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Pritam Singh,Trivendra Singh Rawat,Urban Local Bodies,Uttarakhand,Uttarakhand Urban Local Body Polls","Uttarakhand civic polls: Ruling BJP, Opposition Congress set for major face-off ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha election",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/uttarakhand-civic-polls-ruling-bjp-opposition-congress-set-for-major-face-off-ahead-of-2019-lok-sabha-election-5563591.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Controversial politician and six-time independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh, also known as Raja Bhaiya, on Friday said he will float a new party opposed to reservation in promotions and the draconian provisions of the SC/ST Act. The former minister who now represents Kunda Assembly constituency said the new party will have 'Jansatta' (people's power) as its prefix. Singh said the Election Commission has been approached for the registration of the new party as ""Jansatta Party"", ""Jansatta Loktantrik Party"" or ""Jansatta Dal"". The group, which will hold a rally soon, and is yet to decide on contesting the coming Lok Sabha polls, he told reporters. Singh has been a minister in state governments headed by Akhilesh Yadav, Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh. He has faced 48 cases and has been the state's prisons minister in the Samajwadi Party government. ""Today, I have completed 25 years in active politics. This is my sixth term as an independent MLA,"" Raja Bhaiya said. He said that among the issues that his party will raise is the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which he said has ""draconian provisions"". The apparent reference were to provisions related to immediate arrests under the Act, which were diluted by the Supreme Court but later restored through a Bill in Parliament. ""Going by the fundamental principle of equality, whether it is a heinous crime like rape or murder, Dalits are being treated differently and given compensation by the government while the general public and the upper castes are left out,"" he said. ""No investigation is required under the SC/ST Act before an arrest is made,"" he said. ""This should change."" ""We are also against reservation in promotion on caste basis,"" he said. ""It should be on the basis of capability. This is our clear stand."" Asked if his party aimed to woo the upper castes that may be unhappy with the ruling BJP, he said he has the support of people belonging to different castes and sections of society.

Press Trust of India,": Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Friday ruled out the possibility of tying up with the BJP or the Congress to form the government in Chhattisgarh, asserting that her alliance with Ajit Jogi's party would get absolute majority. ""When our alliance is fully confident of getting an absolute majority (in the 90-member House), where does the question of a post-poll tie-up with the BJP or the Congress arise?"" the Dalit leader said when asked about which way her party would go in such a scenario. ""This is a mischievous question. The question does not arise. The second phase of the polling is yet to take place,"" the BSP supremo told a news channel. Dismissing the suggestion as hypothetical, Mayawati said the alliance — with Jogi's Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) — would prefer to sit in the Opposition if it could not form the government on its own. ""At present the question of extending or taking support from any party does not arise,"" she told  . Describing the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress as ""saap nath"" and ""naag nath"" (snakes), the 62-year-old leader said there was no question of having any truck with either of the two. ""The BJP and the Congress are anti-poor, anti-farmer, anti-Dalit, anti-downtrodden, and anti-weaker sections."" To a question as to why her party could not forge an alliance with the Congress, Mayawati said she had already spoken in detail about it in the past. In a snub to the Congress, the BSP had announced its decision to contest the state election in alliance with the JCC, declaring Jogi as the chief ministerial face of the coalition. The JCC is contesting 55 seats, while the BSP is in the fray in the rest. In the outgoing House, the BSP has only one seat. While 18 assembly constituencies in the state went to polls in the first phase on Monday, voting will take place in the remaining 72 seats next Tuesday.

Press Trust of India," CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury Friday said the BJP governments at the Centre and in Rajasthan had failed to perform and the party had no alternative but to fuel communal polarisation to win elections. He said the issues of Ram Temple, Sabarimala Temple and changing names of cities are being raked up by the BJP during election season for vote bank politics. The BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Rajasthan have failed in their policies and performance, Yechury said at a press conference here. There is strong resentment and angst among people against the party. So, the BJP is left with no alternative but to fuel communal polarisation to win elections, he said. The CPM leader said the ruling party is trying to consolidate the Hindu vote bank and has already created an environment of violence and hatred. Yechury said his party's effort will be to oust the BJP from Rajasthan and it has decided to field 28 candidates from various seats in the state. Responding to a question about forming an alliance with other political parties, he said the CPM would support in forming an alternative secular government after elections.  ",2018-11-17,"BJP,CPM,Hindutva,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Ram Temple Issue,Sitaram Yechury,TheySaidIt","Rajasthan polls: BJP failed to perform, resorting to communal polarisation to win election, says CPM leader Sitaram Yechury",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-bjp-failed-to-perform-resorting-to-communal-polarisation-to-win-election-says-cpm-leader-sitaram-yechury-5566371.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjib Kr Baruah,"Politics in football is never a good thing, but the reverse, albeit a rarity, is likely to bring much good cheer — whether you are a sports lover or not. And playing the centre-forward position in this foray is the poster boy of Mizoram football Robert Romawia Royte – “call me Triple R,” he says – a flamboyant personality replete with fast cars and super bikes. A self-made man and the main force behind the rags-to-riches story of the Aizawl Football Club (AFC), which won the I-League in the 2016-17 season, Royte is contesting the state Assembly election to be held on 28 November on a Mizo National Front (MNF) ticket from the Aizawl East-II seat. Books have been written on the stunning rise of the club. “Football is the biggest industry in Mizoram and I am the industrialist,” Royte says. “Every other business is running a loss but from football, we are gaining. A lot of money is being pumped into Mizoram because of football.” With players like Jeje Lalpekhlua, the highest goal scorer in the Indian Super League till now, and many other Mizo players of his level earning about a crore rupees every season, a lot of money is being poured into this hilly northeastern state. Royte would, of course, be happy with due recognition being accorded to the beautiful game. “It is a declared industry in Brazil, Sweden, Spain, South Korea and England where it is has been lucrative. It is not so here maybe because of ignorance or act of omission on part of the government, but in practical terms, football is the biggest industry in Mizoram. For a small state with a population of about 12-13 lakh, we send 4-5 Mizo players to the Indian national football team all the time.” The status football holds in Mizoram is unquestionable. The location of the Mizoram Football Association bang opposite the Raj Bhavan where the governor resides, and almost next to the state Assembly building, may be symbolic of the game’s standing. Royte can, of course, teach a thing or two when it comes to the business of football, and he has gone international. The former footballer owns 11 football academies across Mizoram, Tripura and one in Myanmar (Tahan Aizawl Football Academy). Tahan is a town in Myanmar largely inhabited by Mizos. “Although Mizoram had such huge football talent, it never had a professional club. In 2012, I took over the Aizawl FC where I was the president since 2011. I introduced a corporate style of functioning and that was the beginning of professionalism in football in Mizoram,” says Royte. The new style of functioning has now led to a huge pool of about 300 talented footballers in Mizoram. They include the senior team which has been playing the I-League, about 35 footballers in the junior team, 35 in the under-18 team, 35 in under-15 and another 35 in under-13, besides others in the football academies. “I believe in building of teams, not in the purchase of players. 90 percent of the players in my teams are homegrown. Even in big teams like Mohun Bagan or East Bengal, how many of the players are locals?” he says. Asked if politics would be his new priority, though he had also unsuccessfully contested the last parliamentary polls as an independent candidate, Royte says: “Football has been my passion since childhood. It is not a switchover from football to politics. Football will continue till my death. Football will always be a part of my life.” With cricket teams being set up in all northeastern states at the behest of the resource-rich Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and taking the immense popularity of the willow and leather game into account, does he see football’s popularity being threatened? “Football is everywhere in Mizoram; it plays a very important role in every family. People play for a sense of self-satisfaction and for happiness. Cricket is a very important game, but there is no chance of it overtaking football in this region and in Mizoram. Cricket will, of course, grow, but it will never be at par with football,” Royte says with a lot of assurance. The 51-year-old has a new dream now. “I am building a residential football academy about 15 km from Aizawl where boys will live and dream football. I have already invested about Rs 5-6 crore there.” Boys? What about girls, or women’s football teams where north-easterners haven’t done too badly? “I had a strong desire to build a strong women's football team but apathy and lack of financial support put paid to my plans. I must say this that the manner in which the All India Football Federation organises the tournaments and the manner in which they treat the women’s teams was a revelation. That is when I thought it was perhaps too early to build a women’s team,” he says. Clearly, the man means business.",2018-11-17,"Aizawl Football Club,Assembly Election 2018,Football,India,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Polls,Politics,Robert Romawia Royte,TheySaidIt",Mizoram polls: Aizawl FC owner contesting elections explains why football is 'the biggest industry' in state,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-aizawl-fc-owner-contesting-assembly-elections-explains-why-football-is-the-biggest-industry-in-state-5564731.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The Congress on Friday accused the BJP of being an anti-Christian party, saying the saffron party was trying to enter Christian-dominated Mizoram ""through backdoor"" after the 28 November election in the state. Christians constitute around 87 percent of the population of Mizoram, according to the 2011 Census. Mizoram is the only state in the northeast where the Congress is in power. ""The BJP is against minorities and the Christians... The party has brought intolerance and hatred against Christians and other minorities,"" Congress general secretary Luizinho Faleiro told reporters in Aizawl. He asked why did the BJP choose to observe Good Governance Day on 25 December, when it seeks to celebrate the next Christmas in Mizoram under its rule. The senior Congress leader was referring to BJP president Amit Shah's statement at a rally in October that he ""was reassured that the next Christmas Mizoram celebrates will be a Christmas under a BJP government."" In 2014, the BJP-led central government had decided to observe 25 December, the day of Christmas celebrations, as national Good Governance Day. 25 December is also the birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Faleiro alleged that the BJP has been ""trying to enter Mizoram politics through backdoor by using the MNF as it had done in other north eastern states"". The Opposition Mizo National Front (MNF), led by former chief minister Zoramthanga, is a constituent of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) headed by the saffron party, he said. NEDA is a political coalition formed by the BJP and regional political parties of the northeastern states in 2016. The Congress has been alleging that the MNF would form a post-poll alliance with the BJP in the event of a hung Assembly. However, both the parties denied it. The ruling party also alleged that the  after the Assembly polls to ""grab power at all costs"" and Independent MLAs would be the most vulnerable in that scenario. The BJP has denied this charge too. The Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), a conglomerate of two political parties and five other organisations, also faced the attack of the Congress as its 35 candidates are contesting the polls as Independents. The ZNP on Friday said it would not form a pre-poll or a post-poll alliance with the BJP. The foundations of the ZPM were safety of the land, the people and religion, and there was no scope for an alliance with the saffron party, ZPM senior vice president Kenneth Chawngliana said. He said the 35 ZPM candidates had to contest as Independents as the party was formed hardly a year ago and had never contested elections in the past. ""We would be recognised by the Election Commission and allotted a symbol only after contesting and have a requisite number of legislators or share of votes,"" he said. He said the ZPM nominees signed a pledge and also announced chief ministerial candidate before the election.",2018-11-16,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,TheySaidIt,ZPM","Mizoram polls: Congress accuses BJP of being anti-Christian, says it is trying to enter government through 'backdoor'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-congress-accuses-bjp-of-being-anti-christian-says-it-is-trying-to-enter-government-through-backdoor-5565201.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the land acquired for industrialists will be returned to original owners if his party comes to power in Madhya Pradesh and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, calling it the ""biggest scam"". Addressing rallies in support of his party candidates for the 28 November polls in Madhya Pradesh, where campaigning has reached its crescendo, he said key laws targeted at disadvantaged sections of the society will be implemented in letter and spirit. Gandhi said the BJP, in power in Madhya Pradesh since 2003, is only working for a few rich people. He said the land acquired from tribals, farmers and the poor for industrialists during the 15-year BJP rule in Madhya Pradesh will be returned to them by his party when it forms a government after the polls. Addressing a public rally in Barghat, Seoni district, he said, ""After coming to power the Narendra Modi government attacked three laws — tribal rights, land acquisition and PESA (Provisions of the Panchayats - Extension to Scheduled Areas - Act), but we did not allow it to happen."" ""We will protect your land after coming to power, and implement these acts in letter and spirit. We will give your land back to you...this is your right, we will make it happen and get the land returned to you,"" he said. Gandhi said Modi had asked his party's chief ministers in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat to stop the implementation of land acquisition law (enacted under the UPA), which allows acquisition only after the consent of landowner and that too after paying four-times the land's cost. Instead, Modi told his party's chief ministers to ""snatch"" the land of the poor and hand it over to industrialists, he alleged. Modi had said he did not want to become the country's prime minister, but its 'chowkidar' (watchman), Gandhi said. ""It was thought that he would become chowkidar of farmers, labourers, youths, mothers, sisters and weaker sections. But, he became a chowkidar of (industrialist) Anil Ambani,"" he alleged. Gandhi continued, ""Chowkidar remained silent when Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Mehul Choksi (all accused of committing financial frauds) escaped from the country after usurping thousands of crores."" The Congress chief said money is being put in the pockets of 15-20 select industrialists. Addressing a public meeting in tribal-dominated Mandla district, Gandhi termed demonetisation as ""the biggest scam"" in the history of the country and reiterated that the note-ban exercise was undertaken to benefit a few industrialists. ""Have you seen any big person like Ambani and others in the queue after demonetisation?"" he asked. Gandhi attacked Modi over the note ban at another rally in Sagar district and accused him of ""robbing the poor of their hard-earned money and given it away to a few rich people"". Gandhi said Modi no longer talks about being a ""chowkidar (watchman) of the country and of tackling corruption. Gandhi claimed that Modi ""cancelled the Rafale deal of 126 fighter aircraft with Dassault Aviation and HAL at a price of Rs 526 crore per plane"" without informing the Indian Air Force and the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar. ""The then French president Francois Hollande has said the Indian government had asked for Anil Ambani to be taken on board for the deal,"" the Congress chief alleged. ""Modi gave Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani in this deal. This is the chowkidari he has done,"" Gandhi alleged. Both the government and Ambani-led Reliance Group have vehemently charges of favouritism and any irregularities in the Rs 58,000-crore Rafale deal. After the note ban, Modi made honest and hardworking citizens stand in queues outside banks, Gandhi said. ""These days, the prime minister's speeches don't have any mention of (eradicating) corruption, a tall promise that he had made before coming to power,"" Gandhi claimed. Madhya Pradesh will have a single phase polling for its 230 assembly seats on November 28 and the counting of votes will take place on 11 December.

Press Trust of India," A tough road awaits veteran L Sarita Devi and rookie Manisha Moun as they open India's campaign at the AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships on Friday. The 36-year-old Sarita, who got a first round bye in 60kg category, faces Diana Sandra Brugger of Switzerland in the second round. Brugger had defeated Huswatun Hasanah of Indonesia in the first round as the 10th edition of the championships began at the KD Jhadav Stadium on Thursday. Sarita, who won a gold in the 2006 edition held here, has come into the tournament after winning a bronze each in the India Open and Silesian Women's Boxing championship in Gliwice, Poland this year. Her opponent Brugger, on the other hand, does not have a formidable reputation. But, it will not be an easy outing for the Manipuri as her opponent has been an experienced campaigner having taken part in World Championships since 2008. Sarita, seeded fourth in the tournament, would be searching for her second gold at home but to do that she will have to beat the likes of defending world champion Yang Wenlu of China and Rio Olympics bronze medallist Anastasia Beliakova of Russia. They have been clubbed with Sarita in the lower half of the draw. On the other hand, the 20-year old Manisha (54kg) faces 2016 World Championships bronze medallist Christina Cruz of the United States in her first round bout. Cruz is also a bronze medallist at the 2012 World Championships but Manisha was not perturbed by her opponent's reputation. ""I am ready for the bout, we have prepared very well and I am excited to be competing in my first World Championships,"" Manisha told reporters before team practice. Manisha won a silver in the Senior Nationals and a gold in the India Open this year. She also won a silver in the Silesian Women's Boxing championship in Poland where she defeated reigning world champion Dina Zholaman of Kazakhstan. ""I am not thinking about my opponent. In fact, I know just a few names of boxers in my weight category. When I beat the world champion in Poland, I did not know that she is the reining world champion. I came to know only later,"" she said. Asked if she is feeling the pressure ahead of her World Championships debut, ""No, there is no pressure. Rather, I feel happy that my first major tournament is a World Championship and that also in front of home crowd. ""Everyday I speak to seniors like Mary Kom and Sarita Devi and they tell me how to prepare myself before bouts. They give useful tips.""

Borgahain, who got a first round bye, will either face 2014 World Championships gold medallist Atheyna Bylon of Panama or Yulia Stoiko of Ukraine. ""The Panama boxer is a world champion and so it will be a tough bout but I have also prepared well. My weight category will also be in the 2020 Olympics and so there are many top contenders.

Press Trust of India,": Members of 32 families of Bru refugees, who were repatriated to Mizoram, will be able to cast their votes in the coming Assembly elections in the state, officials said Thursday. As many as 19 families were rehabilitated in Lunglai district in Mizoram after their repatriation from Tripura, 11 families were settled in Mamit district and two in Kolasib district of the state in the past two months. ""The total number of people in these families is around 150 and those who are eligible among them can cast their votes in the polls,"" a home ministry official said. Mizoram goes to polls on 28 November. The Election Commission Thursday appointed IAS officer Ashish Kundra as Mizoram's new chief electoral officer, replacing SB Shashank in accordance with the demand of some civil society groups. The groups were asking for Shashank's ouster over a row on allowing Bru voters lodged in Tripura relief camps to exercise their franchise from there. The agitation against Shashank was launched a fortnight back with the NGO Coordination Committee, the apex body of civil societies, and students' organisations in the north-eastern state, demanding that the officer be replaced as chief electoral officer and transferred outside the state. It also demanded that Bru voters in six Tripura relief camps be allowed to exercise their franchise at their respective polling stations in Mizoram and not in Tripura as committed by the poll panel in 2014. The agreement to repatriate the total 32,876 people belonging to the Bru community, who have been living in relief camps in Tripura was signed by the Centre and the governments of Mizoram and Tripura on 3 July.

Press Trust of India,"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday stoked a controversy by making a veiled attack against former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, saying ""agents from Italy"" facilitated religious conversions of local tribals when the party was in power in the state. Addressing a campaign rally in Jashpur for the second phase of Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Adityanath said, ""Italy  "" (agents imported from Italy), undertook ""anti-national"" activities like conversion of tribals in the state.

Press Trust of India,": West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday alleged that ""dirty politics"" is going on in the name of publication of the final draft of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam as names of genuine voters have been struck off the list. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo asserted that she was not against the Assam government, but she does not support NRC. ""I still believe that dirty politics is being played in the name of the NRC. Names of genuine voters have been struck off the list. We do not support this,"" Banerjee said during her visit to Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. She was here to take part in the birth centenary celebrations of Binapani Devi Thakur, known as  , the revered 'mother' of the Matua community. The community originally hailed from present-day Bangladesh and migrated to India over the past five decades. Banerjee has been very critical of the BJP-led government at the Centre since the publication of the final draft of Assam's NRC on 30 July. She had accused the BJP of resorting to ""divide and rule"" politics in the country and the Narendra Modi government of trying to make millions of people ""stateless"" in Assam for political gains. The TMC supremo had warned that stripping the people of their citizenship could lead to ""bloodbath"" and a ""civil war"" in the country. ""They (the Centre) are driving away Bengalis from Assam. In Gujarat they are trying to drive away Biharis. We never do this here in West Bengal. We have assured them (Bengalis in Assam) that we are beside them. They must not forget Bengal is also their home. ""We are not against Assam (government). But in the name of the NRC, lakhs of people have been kept off the list. Is it a crime to speak in Bengali?"" the chief minister asked. Asserting that many people from erstwhile East Pakistan had come to India as refugees, she said, ""All those who came to India before 1971 are very much Indian citizens. They have their name on the voters' list, have ration cards and caste certificates."" ""You are an Indian citizen and that is your identity. It cannot be taken away from you.

Press Trust of India," Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday challenged the Congress to make someone from outside the Gandhi family its chief for at least five years if it respected democracy, as he returned the Congress' barb that a  could rise to power only because of democratic systems established by Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. In an apparent attack on the Gandhi family, Modi also said that the Gandhi family, of which four generations have previously ruled the country, cannot fathom how the son of a poor mother can sit on the   (throne). Addressing a poll rally in Chhattisgarh's Surguja district for the second phase of the state assembly elections scheduled for 20 November, Modi also hit back at the Congress for questioning demonetisation, saying the move ""still rankles"" them as the money ""stashed under beds and in sacks"" was taken away in a single stroke. While the BJP has been ruling Chhattisgarh for 15 continuous years, the Congress was in power in the state only for three years after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000. Traditionally, the two national parties have had a direct fight in this state, although a third force as emerged this time in form of an alliance between the parties of former Congress chief minister Ajit Jogi and of Dalit leader Mayawati. Modi asked Congress to give account of what the four generations of the (Gandhi) family did for the nation before asking for an account of his government's four-and-half years' rule. ""Four generations of the Congress ruled the counry, but they have nothing to tell the people. We are everyday giving an account of what we have done in the last four years,"" he said. ""They (Congress leaders) are saying it was due to a great person, due to Pandit Nehru, that a 'chaiwala' (tea seller) became the prime minister,"" Modi said. ""If you so much respect the democracy, do a small thing. If you claim that because of your principles, your faith in democracy, the Constitution and Pandit Nehru, Modi, a chaiwala, could become the PM, appoint someone good from outside the (Gandhi) family as the Congress president for just five years,"" he said. ""If this happens, I will accept that Nehru ji created such a democratic system because of which anyone, (even) a dedicated Congressman outside the family could become the Congress chief,"" he added. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had said that it was due to the institutional structures created by Nehru that even a  could become India's prime minister. His party colleague Mallikarjun Kharge had also said earlier that a   could become the prime minister as the Congress preserved democracy. Sitaram Kesri had served as the Congress president in the 1990s, but his tenure from September 1996 to March 1998 was less than five years. Rahul Gandhi is currently president of the Congress party, while the post was held by his mother Sonia Gandhi before that. A Congress president mostly gets a three-year term, though there have been exceptions. Continuing his barbs at the Gandhi family, Modi said the ""contract of democracy"" in the country was not given to one family, but they felt the Britishers had named India after it. ""They still keep crying that how could a chaiwala sit (on the PM's chair). How could he? They still cannot fathom how come the son of a poor mother could sit on the throne"" he said. Stating that such people cannot understand difficulties faced by the poor, but a chaiwala can, he said the credit for making a 'chaiwala' the prime minister goes to 125 crore Indians and not to Modi or the BJP. The prime minister also took on Rahul Gandhi for attacking him over demonetisation, saying only one ""family"" is ""crying"" over the note-ban exercise. ""No one from those sitting here (in the rally) is crying over demonetisation, but only one family is crying. Their associates lost their illegally earned money filled in bags, hidden inside their bed and pillow after demonetisation,"" the prime minister said. Modi also said Chhattisgarh was created peacefully during the tenure of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in contrast to violence during agitations for bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh under the Congress rule. He said the BJP is the only unbiased party and it is guided by the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', while the Congress kept the country in dark with lies that are ingrained in their minds. He also hailed the high voter turnout in the first phase of polling held in the state on 12 November for 18 seats, which covered Maoist-affected constituencies, saying the people of Bastar gave a strong response to Naxals by registering record voting percentage in the first phase. Despite threats given by Naxals to chop off fingers of those who will vote, tribals came out in large numbers to vote, he said. Modi urged voters of the remaining 72 assembly seats to show the same enthusiasm in the second phase on 20 November. Counting of votes for both phases would be held on 11 December. He said election offers the best opportunity to ""punish"" those who think it is the right of only one family to rule the country. ""When I had come to Ambikapur during last Lok Sabha elections, people had made a replica of Red Fort for my rally which annoyed a few people in Delhi as they thought it was the right of only one family to speak from Red Fort.

FP Politics,"BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, in a speech at Mumbai several years ago, had made an   aimed at Congress leader Sonia Gandhi. He boasted about having sent Kanimozhi and A Raja to Tihar jail (in the 2G case) and said that the jailer there was complaining that the cook has a problem on his hands as the Tamil prisoners keep asking for masala dosas. After this, Swamy said, ""I told the jailer to wait till an Italian also comes,"" subsequent to which there was loud applause. This statement was reflective of how Italy, a country smaller in size than several Indian states, has acquired much importance in national politics. A recent example of this is the statement of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath alleging in Chhattisgarh that Italian agents are responsible for conversion and anti-national acts. ""During the Congress’ three-year rule in Chhattisgarh, anti-national activities of religious conversion by agents of Italy were at their peak,"" Adityanath was   as saying. However, references to Italy and Italian nationals have been a regular feature of political discourse in India for many years now. Here's an overview. Quattrochi — an Italian businessman — was accused of having acted as a conduit for receiving bribes in the alleged Bofors scandal, which contributed majorly to the Congress under Rajiv Gandhi losing the subsequent parliamentary election. Sten Lindstorm, who investigated the scandal, had   that Rajiv had allowed a massive cover-up aimed at protecting Quattrochi, although he did not personally receive any payoffs. The allegations pertain to a deal with Swedish manufacturer AB Bofors for the supply of 155 mm Howitzer guns for the army in 1986. A year after the deal was finalised, a Swedish radio channel had alleged that the company bribed senior Indian politicians and defence personnel with the aim of clinching the deal. VP Singh, who led the campaign against the Congress for the 1989 Lok Sabha election, had made the Bofors scandal a key component of his rhetoric. An article by Shekhar Gupta in   recounts the manner in which he would accuse Rajiv Gandhi of corruption. Singh, the article notes, would ask people to imagine a situation in which a lion, a horse, a bull, a cat lived close by. On one morning, the owner of the circus found the carcasses of the horse and bull. ""You think anyone had doubts on who had eaten them? The lion or the cat? If such big money has been eaten here, will some petty cat eat it?"" the article quoted Singh as saying. While the payoffs in the case were said to be to the tune of  , no one was convicted in the case. When Sonia Gandhi visited Karnataka last year ahead of Assembly elections in that state, the state BJP put out a   saying, ""Today, Ms Antonio Maino is here in Karnataka to save her last citadel from falling!"" Such references to the Italian origins of Sonia Gandhi have been frequently made by the saffron party ever since she entered active politics. On this issue, Sonia had  , ""I am an Indian and shall remain so till my last breath."" Sonia was initially opposed to her husband joining politics, and was quoted by   as saying that this was because she feared that ""they would have got him...they would have killed him...And I was right; that did happen"" However, seven years after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, Sonia joined politics in 1998. At that time, the Congress ruled only   and had just 141 members in the Lok Sabha. After she took over, the fortunes of the grand old party changed, and it unexpectedly won the parliamentary election in 2004. However, the prospect of Sonia becoming the prime minister had the BJP up in arms, with Sushma Swaraj saying that she would shave her head and wear white if she were to take up the post. The Congress leader said that she had decided to listen to her inner voice and desist from taking up the post of prime minister. Two marines from Italy — Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone — were accused of killing two Kerala fishermen in February 2012. The incident had spurred a political controversy as well as an international legal battle. India has alleged that the two fishermen were killed without warning, while Italy has claimed that the marines had assessed that the fishermen's vessel was on a collision course with the oil tanker they were travelling on, as reported by  Italy has further claimed that the modus operandi of the fishermen was consistent with a pirate attack. The main legal issues involving the case was to do with the jurisdiction of the case. The Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in August 2016 that India had no jurisdiction in the case, referring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Both Latorre and Girone are now in Italy, after the   in 2016 allowed the former to return to his home country. There were four conditions imposed on him, which included reporting to a police station in Italy on first Wednesday of every month and the Italian authorities have to inform the Indian Embassy in Rome about it.

Press Trust of India,"Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K T Rama Rao said Thursday his party would attempt to gather more like-minded parties across the country after the Assembly polls. Rama Rao, son of TRS president and caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, said the party would make efforts to strengthen the federal structure after the declaration of election results. Expressing confidence that they would win the Assembly polls scheduled for 7 December, the TRS leader said, ""I didn't want to jump the gun. Our focus is on state politics till 11 December (result day). After 11th, we will start talking about our efforts to gather more like-minded parties across the country. We had already started earlier."" He asserted that even before Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and others ""woke up from sleep"", it was the TRS president who started efforts to forge an alternative platform to the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The TRS' idea is that states should be strengthened further in a federal system and that the Centre should decentralise its powers more, Rama Rao told reporters here. ""Our idea is not to take power in 2019 by bringing in some people together... We are moving ahead with an inspirational thought that this country should improve. Both the Congress and the BJP have failed in this issue. We have no second thought about this."" Rao was replying to a query on criticism that the TRS was soft in pressing for the implementation of promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Denying that the TRS has adopted any soft stance, he said the TRS do not fear the BJP, Congress, TDP or their top leaders. The TRS government made efforts to realise the promises mentioned in the state reorganisation act, but the NDA government did not respond adequately, he alleged. Accusing the NDA government of letting the country down, Rama Rao said there was no need for the TRS to have a soft corner towards the BJP and it was making efforts to ensure that the saffron party faces a rout in the state. Both the Congress and the BJP have failed the state, he added. Dismissing criticism that Chandrasekhar Rao was not accessible to public representatives and common people, he said the job of the chief minister was to do planning and visioning, and entrust the responsibility of execution to officials. Rama Rao said he would take political 'sanyas' (renunciation) if the TRS failed to come to power on its own. ""Does any of the leaders who claim to be coming to power have the courage to accept this challenge?"" To a query on why the TRS chose to dissolve the Assembly prematurely, he said the Assembly could be dissolved if the state cabinet takes a decision as per a right given under the Constitution. Several leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, N Chandrababu Naidu and Narendra Modi, exercised that option and had gone for polls ahead of schedule. 
""The Congress, BJP, Telugu Desam, every party, every government exercised that facility on some occasion. The TRS government took a decision using the same facility, same Constitution. We feel the decision we took is correct. ""We are accountable to the people and we are answering the people... People will give verdict if they feel our decision is right,"" he said.

FP Staff,"Alleging that genuine Muslim ticket aspirants have been ignored, senior Telangana Congress leader Abid Rasool Khan on Friday quit the party. A former chairman of the state Minorities Commission, Khan said the Congress should give tickets to Muslims in one constituency each in the 10 old districts of the state where the party have chances to win. ""Can they not do that much?"" the state Congress vice-president asked in a poser to the party's central leadership. The Congress has so far announced candidates in 75 constituencies, which include four Muslims, for the 7 December polls to the 119-member state Assembly. The party has forged an alliance with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) to take on the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Under the seat-sharing formula announced by the Congress, the TDP would contest in 14 constituencies, TJS in eight and the CPI in three. The Congress would field nominees in 94 segments. Khan, who had first threatened to quit the party on Thursday, said that of the four Muslim candidates announced by the Congress, two have joined the party only recently and one was not even a member of the outfit. ""We (Muslim leaders of Telangana) are very upset. Our president, Rahul Gandhi, has time and again said he will take care of genuine workers, and he will not allow paratroopers to enter the party and take out the cake.

The Congress leadership, he insisted, has to shift the Reddy community members from these towns and give tickets to Muslims. ""They (Reddy community members) can win from anywhere, as they are strong financially, but Muslims cannot win from other seats."" Khan added that if the Congress leadership was ""so helpless"", they should give a commitment that all nominated MLC (member of legislative council) seats would be given to Muslims and Christians.

Kangkan Acharyya,"The BJP's foray into the North East has faced a challenge after the Centre's move to pass the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. The saffron party is likely to face testing times in Assam during the panchayat election early next month. The panchayat elections are seen as a test for political parties in Assam ahead of the Lok Sabha election. The BJP's popularity has now dropped after having soared to unprecedented heights after the publication of the final draft of the NRC on 30 July. State Election Commissioner HN Bora, announcing the   at a press conference held on 5 November, said that the exercise will be held in two phases on 5 and 9 December. There are 2,200 panchayats in Assam. The election is being held at a time when the state is going through a turbulent phase due to the resurfacing of an old fault line between Bengali Hindus and the Assamese people, after the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016. The Bill aims at providing citizenship to illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians. However, it does not have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmediyas, who also face persecution in Pakistan. The Centre’s move has brought back the fear among indigenous tribes and ethnic groups of becoming minorities. These fears have been aggravated due to the Centre’s recent notification to register Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian infiltrators from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh as Indians in 16 districts across seven states in India. “Though the order is related to districts which do not belong to Assam, we see the move as something clearly in opposition to our demand to detect and deport illegal migrants, irrespective of their religious affiliations,” All Assam Students Union general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi   in an earlier report. The BJP’s image as the saviour of the indigenous tribes and ethnic groups in the region, which it cultivated carefully over the years, has taken a beating after the Centre’s move to grant citizenship to Hindu Bangladeshi immigrants. A delegation of all the student unions of the region had recently met the Union home minister and demanded that the Bill should not be further pursued. However, many Bengali organisations had supported the Bill. The rift between the two communities over this issue resulted in sporadic violence, and also bandhs called by both Bengali and Assamese organisations. On the night of 1 November, five innocent men were killed by unknown assailants in  . The impasse may escalate soon, as 70 organisations representing various tribes and ethnic groups in Assam have decided to launch a massive protest on 16 November in front of the Assam Legislative Assembly. Bhaben Handique, one of the leaders of the protest, said that people from all corners of Assam would reach the Assam Assembly and take part in a bike rally. “The objective of this protest is to either compel the central government to drop the Bill or to compel the Assam government to resign,” he said. A few months ago, the situation for the BJP-led government in Assam was different, and it enjoyed good popularity due to the publication of the final draft of the NRC. At the time, people at many places distributed sweets, as the publication of the list marked the success of a 40-year-old struggle. The credit of this success, without doubt, went to the BJP-led state government. However, the move to introduce the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill has brought the saffron party's march in Assam to a halt. It has reversed the gains that the BJP had achieved ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the 2016 Assembly election, by consolidating the votes of both Hindu Bengalis and Assamese people.    ",2018-11-16,"2016,Assam,Assam Panchayat Elections,Citizenship (Amendment) Bill,ConnectTheDots,HN Bora,NRC,Sarbananda Sonowal",BJP faces the heat in Assam as 70 tribal groups set to protest citizenship for Hindu Bangladeshi immigrants today,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-faces-the-heat-in-assam-as-70-tribal-groups-set-to-protest-citizenship-for-hindu-bangladeshi-immigrants-today-5558721.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Looking to retain power in Rajasthan, the BJP has denied tickets to its 43 sitting MLAs, including four ministers, even as some leaders who have crossed over from other parties have been fielded for the upcoming Assembly elections. The ruling party has released two lists so far of 162 candidates for the elections to be held on 7 December for 200 Assembly constituencies. Names of more candidates are expected to be announced soon. The BJP had released its first list of 131 candidates on 11 November, while the second list of 31 candidates was announced on 14 November. In the second list itself, the party denied tickets to 14 sitting MLAs and three ministers. In the two lists, a total of 92 sitting MLAs have been fielded again in the election. The BJP had won 163 seats in the 2013 election, while its arch-rival Congress could get just 21. Traditionally, these two parties have ruled the state one after another. So far, the saffron party has given tickets to 19 women candidates. Besides, four leaders who have joined the BJP from other parties have also got the party ticket for the polls. These include Abhinesh Mehrishi, who would contest from Ratangarh seat after quitting BSP, Congress leaders Ashok Sharma and Mahesh Pratap Singh (for Rajakheda and Nathdwara seats, respectively) and two-time independent legislator Gurdeep Shahpini (Sangaria seat). Those having been denied a ticket include Gyan dev Ahuja, a sitting MLA from Ramgarh seat of Alwar. When contacted, Ahuja declined to comment on denial of ticket from his existing constituency. ""I would comment only after meeting the office bearers of the RSS,"" Ahjua told   on Thursday. He said he has not met Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje so far on this issue. The BJP ministers who have been denied ticket by the party from their existing seats include Babulal Verma, Dhan Singh Rawat, Rajkumar Rinwa and Surendra Goyal. Goyal has resigned from the party and has announced he will contest the election independently. The denial of ticket to leaders like Gyan dev Ahuja and Dhan Singh Rawat has come as a surprise to many, even as they have been known for their hardliner comments that have often triggered controversies. Sheo constituency MLA Manvendra Singh has joined the Congress while the Nathdwara Assembly seat fell vacant after the demise of BJP legislator Kalyan Singh Chouhan.

It is also being keenly watched what would be the fate of the chief minister's close aide Yunus Khan, who was fielded from Deedwana Assembly seat in last election.

In the Rafale deal, the most ""sensational"" thing is the government's own admission in the apex court that there was no sovereign guarantee from the French government, but only a letter of comfort, which is not legally enforceable to ensure the delivery of this high value contract, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury told reporters. On the price of the aircraft, the government stated in March 2018 that the cost of the basic aircraft is Rs 670 crores per plane, Yechury said. But, in September 2016, the government had pointed out that it was Rs 60,000 crore for 36 aircraft, including all modifications, making it Rs 1,600 crore per plane, the CPM leader said. Yechury said the CEO of French company Dassault, which is manufacturing the Rafale aircraft, is now saying that the price of 36 fly away planes is equal to 18 fly away ordered in the deal earlier. ""These figures obviously do not corroborate. New facts are coming out on the irregularities of the government in clinching the Rafale deal,"" he said. ""Nothing less than a Supreme Court-monitored SIT probe can bring out the truth and fix accountability. This is of paramount importance in the interest of the nation and particularly, the security of the country,"" Yechury said. His remarks came amid the opposition escalating its attack on the government over allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal.

Press Trust of India," The ruling Congress in Mizoram on Wednesday alleged that the BJP would indulge in horse-trading after the Assembly polls to ""grab power at all costs"" and Independent MLAs would be the most vulnerable in that scenario. The state BJP, however, vehemently denied the charge, saying the party had never indulged in horse-trading and does not have any intention to do so. Elections to the 40-member Mizoram Assembly would be held on 28 November. It is the only state in the northeastern region of the country where the Congress is in power. The ruling party in the state also attacked the Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), a conglomerate of seven organisations, as its 35 candidates are contesting the polls as Independents. ""With the BJP intending to grab power at all costs, the Independent candidates would be most vulnerable during horse-trading,"" state Congress spokesperson Lallianchhunga said during a press conference here. He also alleged that if the BJP managed to win even two or three seats it would indulge in poaching in order to be in the government through back door, as the party had done in states of the region — Meghalaya and Nagaland. In Meghalaya, the BJP, with only two MLAs, is now a part of the National People's Party (NPP) led government. In the February election, Meghalaya had thrown up a fractured mandate with the Congress emerging as the largest party, marginally ahead of its rival, the NPP, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Manipur. The NPP formed government with help of the BJP and other parties. In the 60-member Nagaland assembly election in February, the ruling NPP had emerged the single largest party with 27 seats. The NDPP-BJP alliance (29 seats) formed government with the help of an Independent and a JD(U) MLA. The state Congress had alleged that the Mizo National Front (MNF) would form a post-poll alliance with the BJP in the event of a hung assembly. However, both the parties denied it. The ruling party in Mizoram is now training its guns on the ZPM as its candidates are contesting as Independents. Lallianchhunga said the ZPM is not a registered or recognised political party and all the 35 nominees were contesting the polls as Independents and, if they win, would be the ""most vulnerable"" targets of post-poll horse-trading. BJP state unit spokesman Lalrozara said the allegation of horse-trading is baseless and the Congress, facing a massive anti-incumbency wave, is only trying to tarnish the image of the saffron party. Lallianchhunga has also alleged that the BJP's campaigners from the region and Delhi were wooing Chakma and Bru people to ensure that it wins in at least five seats. The ethnic Chakma and Bru community people are dominant factors in five constituencies of Mizoram.",2018-11-14,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,MNF,NDPP,NewsTracker,NPP,Zoram People's Movement,ZPM","Mizoram polls: Congress says BJP will induge in horse-trading 'to grab power at all costs', Independents most vulnerable",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-congress-says-bjp-will-induge-in-horse-trading-to-grab-power-at-all-costs-independents-most-vulnerable-5551201.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service,"Veteran actress Poonam Dhillon joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2004, but it is only now that she has taken on an active role as its Mumbai vice-president. Poonam, who took charge just before Diwali, says she wants to be a ""hardcore worker"" rather than a ""decorative piece"" like most actors in politics. ""I joined the party in 2004. However, because of various commitments or responsibilities, I was supportive, but I was not ready to take on a very active role. It wasn't the right time as both my children were young... Now they are grown up and independent. ""I feel very strongly that the country needs dedicated people who have passion... rather than those who are in politics only for a career. I want to do my bit for my city and my country. That's why I volunteered; now I can do anything that is required as I have the time,"" Poonam told   over phone from Mumbai. The actress, in her mid-50s, began her film career with Yash Raj Films'   40 years ago, and went on to feature in over 80 movies, including  ,   and  . She most recently featured in a television show, but she is no longer associated with it. Poonam is focussed on her new role on the political front. ""Commitment of time is very important. I just don't want to be a decorative piece. All film actors just become decorative pieces; they are called out for certain things and that's it. But I want to be a hardcore worker. That was the intention, and now is the right time for me,"" said the mother of two. Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit, in a query addressed to Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar, via Twitter, asked: ""What's Poonamji's contribution to the party and the society at large that you have made her Mumbai BJP vice-president? Why are those thousands of workers who sacrifice their lives and careers for the party, not given posts? Is Bollywood the criteria?"" To this, Poonam, said: ""I think he should ask Ashish Shelar, because I didn't make the appointment. I have definitely been a silent worker. I did not call any media for the appointment announcement. I don't believe in glorifying things and milking opportunities. ""All I can tell Ashoke Pandit is that I don't go tom-tomming my work; all my social activities are for the betterment of my city and country. I don't go on television and start talking about what I have done. I like to do my things quietly and now that I have a responsibility and a position, maybe he will hear more about what I am doing."" There are a couple of causes Poonam wants to take up, especially helping the families of farmers who commit suicide. ""I've been doing work for the farmers of Maharashtra. I will continue that. The farmers who commit suicide, their families are left so bereft. That's one of the causes I work on... to uplift their aged parents, young wives or children. Farmer suicide is an issue I wish gets eradicated, but in the meanwhile, if there's little help that we can do for the families, that is something I actively want to do,"" Poonam added. Towards this and more causes, she hopes to galvanise support from her friends. ""A lot of our friends are so blessed. I am sure their intentions are to help, but they need an avenue... If we give them an avenue, and they are assured the help will go directly to people and legitimately, they will be happy about it. I want to be a conduit in that,"" Poonam said. While her role is to do with the Mumbai BJP, the actress said she will be ""happy to do work anywhere in the country because that's what my intention is"".

K Nageshwar,"As the Congress-led Opposition combine is battle-ready to take on the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) juggernaut, Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is embarking upon a comprehensive electoral strategy to frustrate the efforts of his rivals. Such a strategy include the following: Painting the Congress-led Mahakutami as proxy for Andhra Pradesh leadership, TRS supremo KCR plans to revive the Telangana sentiment on the poll eve. The prime attack of TRS against the Mahakutami is on TDP. It is a calculated move on part of TRS as the Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP is a marginal player in the Congress-led alliance. Unless the grand alliance wins the polls with a slender margin, the TDP will not have a decisive role in the Telangana government. Yet, TRS targets Congress for its alliance with TDP, describing it as an Andhra Pradesh party. Given the continuing differences between the two Telugu states post-bifurcation, and Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP president Naidu taking a position unpalatable to Telangana on a host of issues confronting the two states, TRS expects to rouse the Telangana sentiment again. TRS expects that Congress is therefore vulnerable to attack as Telangana electorate believes state TDP to be working under the dictates of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister. The Congress is facing dissidence in as many as ten constituencies among the first list of 65 candidates which the party has announced so far. In fact, Congress rivals expected the dissidence to be in more seats. However, TRS expects that the dissidence may mount as Congress and its allies release the full list of 119 candidates. Though TRS also faced severe dissidence in as many as 30 seats, the ruling party could somehow manage it to a larger extent. The resource-rich ruling parties can always score over their Opposition rivals in such matters. Congress, which was busy finalising seat-sharing and selection of candidates, could not exploit the discontent in TRS over the selection of candidates, especially on the issue of re-nomination of almost all its sitting MLAs, many of whom face anti-incumbency. But now, the TRS leadership is strategising promoting rebels from the Opposition camp, especially from the Congress, by capitalising on the dissidence over seat-sharing and selection of candidates. The Congress camp feels that the first list has a large number of strong candidates if their individual capacity in winning the elections is concerned. The party spokesperson Dasoju Sravan Kumar said that majority of Congress candidates are two to three time MLAs, former MPs, former ministers and those who lost narrowly in 2014 when the Telangana sentiment was at its peak and the party was facing anti-incumbency after a ten-year-long spell in power. Even the TRS leaders privately acknowledge this and claim that their leader KCR, who is a master strategist, will certainly have an effective strategy to neutralise this. TRS expects to undertake micro-management in identified constituencies where either Opposition candidates are strong or where TRS is facing internal dissonance. TRS believes the Congress vote may not transfer to its allies — TDP, TJS and CPI. KCR called upon his party machinery to focus on such vulnerabilities of the Opposition conglomerate. Due to heavy competition for Congress candidature in many constituencies, the party finds it difficult to contain discontent in the seats allotted to allies. The problem is much more acute in the seats that are likely to be given to Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) led by Professor Kodandaram. Congress leaders feel that CPI and TJS nominees are not winnable candidates and the party has to make sacrifices for the sake of alliance even as the allies are still sulking over inadequate representation for them in the grand alliance. As the nomination process comes to an end, the confusion and commotion in the Congress-led grand alliance may come down. Yet, TRS expects disgruntlement in the rank and file of different parties. Congress and TDP are historic rivals. Kodandaram, who led the Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) that led the movement for a separate state, was very critical of Congress and TDP during the movement. Thus, TRS hopes that the vote transfer within the Congress-led alliance will not be complete, asserts Taduri Srinivas, TRS spokesperson. Converting the beneficiaries of his government's welfare schemes into vote banks forms the core of KCR's electoral plank. KCR government's welfare schemes like pensions for the old, widows, and the differently-abled, Kalyana Laxmi and Shaadi Mubarak, the financial assistance scheme at the time of a girl's wedding, the Rythu bandhu, capital assistance of Rs 8,000 per acre etc are quite popular. Though there may be inadequacies and lapses in the implementation of welfare schemes, TRS still expects large a vote bank in the form of beneficiaries of these schemes. The field-level reports indicate that many of TRS members in the dissolved Assembly seeking re-election are hugely unpopular among the voters, even as KCR enjoys public support. Therefore, realising this folly, KCR intends to convert the election into a sort of a referendum on himself as his party and its MLAs face anti-incumbency to an extent. KCR's son and the Minister for Information Technology KT Rama Rao, describing KCR as lion, said that there are as many as 20 chief ministerial aspirants in Congress and the leader will be chosen by Delhi and sent to Hyderabad in a sealed cover. This is a clear attempt to convert the election into a personality fight, with KCR having an edge. Social engineering by targeting Muslim vote through understanding with MIM and mobilising specific caste groups is yet another strategy of KCR. In fact, the Assembly was prematurely dissolved to delink the state elections from Lok Sabha polls as KCR feared anti-Modi sentiment would drive the minority vote towards Congress. Similarly, through targeted welfare schemes, KCR tried to rally OBC voters, who were strong supporters of TDP in the united state. KCR intends to disarm Opposition with bitter criticism. He is known for his sharp speeches. Involving the use of powerful Telangana slang is the cynosure of TRS campaign. The chief minister has already addressed few public meetings and is expected to undertake a whirlwind tour of the state. Thus, he wants to set an election agenda, making the Opposition follow him.",2018-11-14,"Assembly Election 2018,Congress,India,K Chandrashekar Rao,KCR,Mahakutami,N.

Sanjib Kr Baruah," In sprawling Aizawl and in the rest of the undulating dark green Lushai hills in Mizoram, the Church is much more than the Sunday mass and families in their Sunday best. Its all powerful and pervasive grip extends from spelling out how Mizos should go about their daily lives to taking socio-political postures for its largely Presbyterian followers. In the backdrop of the state Assembly polls, civic society, represented by the Mizo People's Forum (MPF) — which comprises the powerful Church and NGOs like the influential Young Mizo Association (YMA), and set up by civic society to ensure sanitised polling — is doing much of the talking through ‘Tlangau’ (‘Tlang’ is Hill, ‘au’ is to shout out). These are local announcements made on omnipresent loudspeakers and also from the pulpits in the churches. In doing so, it is also making the Election Commission’s job much easier in ensuring free, fair and economical polls. Even during the very recent fracas over continuation of the embattled state chief electoral officer and demand for reinstatement of a transferred Mizo IAS official, more than anything else, the fight and its result only served to underscore the power the Church wields in this overwhelmingly Christian-majority (87 percent) state. “Of course, I attend mass on Sunday. Everybody here does,” blurted out Ringa, a 37-year-old taxi driver, when asked if he attends Sunday mass. “People should abide by what the Church says. It is for everyone’s good,” Ringa added, nodding at (not without disdain) the wine stores that have opened shop along the one-hour twisting drive from the Lingpui airport to Aizawl town. The alcohol prohibition issue is figuring prominently in the poll campaigns this time. So, on Sundays, the entire Mizoram comes to a standstill as everyone goes to church. There is not even a restaurant open to serve ‘Bai’, that delectable Mizo soupy pork dish peppered with local herbs and vegetables. Every now and then, crackling public announcements raft in from strategically installed loudspeakers all across the city and hill-top villages in this hilly state. Says former Chief Minister Zoramthanga, erstwhile Mizo guerilla fighter who is leading the Mizo National Front (MNF) in the battle of the ballot: “Mizo civic society controls everything. In Mizoram, there is a mike, a loudspeaker in every locality and neighbourhood. Almost every day, local announcements are made.” Besides Aizawl, there are 803 villages in Mizoram, which would work out to more than 4,000 loudspeakers at a rough guess. “The announcements relate to everything that concerns families and the community. Tonight Mr X died, so everyone has to assemble for funeral services. Mr Y is missing, all the young people should go and try to find him. Mr Z has drowned, all the people should go. That particular commodity is available at the local retailer. Don’t do drugs or drink alcohol. It is like the battalion headquarters. And it is working very well,” Zoramthanga said. He has reason to be thrilled as his poll posture is rabidly pro-prohibition. While the clergy in other Christian states in the North East have often voiced the same strand of thought, what is it that the Mizos adhere strictly to what the Presbyterian Synod says? For one, Mizos are a relatively much more homogeneous society as compared to the other northeastern states. Community feeling is extremely strong. There are no Mizo beggars for instance. The poor are taken care of by the community. Says Henry Zodinliana, sociology professor at Mizoram University: “Mizos are already living the neighbourhood model where the Church has a very big role and 'Tlangau' serves that purpose to perfection. While most old traditions have died, ‘Tlangau’ has survived the ravages of time. Nor will it ever disappear. Even for this election, the MPF, which is basically representative of all churches coming together, is using the system to good effect.” Even the government is happy. Says Mina Zoliani, information and PR officer, Mizoram government: “It disseminates information and educates people about the provision of government facilities, like about vaccination programmes, about ration cards etc.” Every Mizo locality gets together on public holidays to clean and spruce up the neighbourhood. So, the clean roads and compounds next to the narrow roads are really no surprise after all. Anyone who cannot contribute a family member to this cleanliness drive has to pay a small amount to the local Young Mizo Association (YMA) coffer which goes on to build the corpus. No wonder that during election times such as these, the ‘Tlangau’ goes into overdrive. The fear of being publicly named and shamed on mikes is instilled. “If anybody is caught handing over cash or distributing freebies or organising large feasts which may entice voters, they are publicly named, causing them much embarrassment. So this is something that they all dread,” explains Vanlalruata, YMA president. YMA has a huge network of 803 branches in Mizoram besides its units in Meghalaya, Tripura and Manipur. These announcements are particularly handy and critical during natural disasters like the very frequent landslides. And to ensure there is no slip, every 'Tlangau' equipment is backed up with batteries and inverters. In order to make the system better, the YMA is already working on bettering its equipment, sound systems and wiring. Undoubtedly, in a country notorious for slippages in the public delivery mechanism of goods and services, the ‘Tlangau’ may be a very apt model for other communities to implement in their own societies. It is not just the business of spirituality for the Mizo church. Politics and the way to handle it is also part of the preaching. “A year before the elections, we impart political education from the pulpit. That is what makes the Church powerful too. We teach the people not to expect any personal material help from the election candidates but to expect good educational facilities, good roads, good infrastructure from them,” says Reverend Lalbiakmawia, general secretary of the MPF. While not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the prescriptions for a sanitised electoral behaviour, the good Reverend believes the effort is fruitful. “It is but below our expectations. After all, between spirituality and politics too, there has to be a fine balance. So we preach the people to elect people who are good.”",2018-11-14,"Aizawl,Assembly Election 2018,ConnectTheDots,India,Mizo People's Forum,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Polls,MNF,MPF,Politics",Mizoram polls: Impact of announcements made on pervasive loudspeakers shows reach of Mizo People's Forum,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-impact-of-announcements-made-on-pervasive-loudspeakers-shows-reach-of-mizo-peoples-forum-5550951.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sandipan Sharma,"On the Indian festival of Karva Chauth in October, perhaps in consonance with the spirit of the occasion, Rajput women saved the dignity and honor of leaders of their community in Rajasthan. Rajput organisations led by Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the burly leader from western Rajasthan who spearheaded the campaign for a ban on Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s  , were expecting a gathering of at least a lakh in response to their call for showcasing their electoral strength. But just a few dozen women, mainly relatives of the leaders, reached the venue to fill up a few seats in a completely empty ground in Jaipur. As the Rajputs and their women, dressed in traditional lehngas (long skirts) and colorful odhnis (shawls), brandished swords on the stage and shouted feeble slogans on the ground, their display of bravado and strength appeared to be a tragi-comic denouement of the campaign the Rajputs had been leading to assert their identity. Rajputs have been on the warpath in Rajasthan on two emotive issues that may sound preposterous to observers outside the state. For almost two years, they have been sulking over their inability to get  —a film based on a fictional account of a Rajput princess—banned. And since June 2017, they have been angry over the encounter killing of Anand Pal Singh, a fugitive considered a hero by many Rajput youth.  has come and gone. Some of its wounds have healed because Rajputs managed a token victory by not allowing theatres to screen the film in Rajasthan and a few adjoining states. But the ghost of the gangster continues to haunt the community and the state's electoral politics. Anand Pal Singh was gunned down by a three teams from Rajasthan and Haryana police in Malasar village of Churu district on 24 June. His encounter led to violent protests among Rajputs and accusations of cold-blooded murder against the police. In the aftermath, several cases were filed against his followers in many police stations. Since his death, Anand Pal has turned into a Robin Hood-esque figure for the community, a symbol of both pride and affection. His followers believe he helped hundreds of Rajput families and helped reestablish their clout on the ground by competing ferociously with their traditional rivals the Jats. “Rajputs are extremely angry with the BJP because of Anand Pal’s encounter and the subsequent harassment of many Rajput families through police cases. They have decided to teach the BJP a lesson,” said Pratap Singh Khachariawas, a prominent Rajput leader and nephew of former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, a BJP stalwart. Many other community leaders echo his sentiments and openly vow to defeat the BJP in the Assembly elections scheduled for December. Rajput leader Giriraj Singh Lotwara said there is widespread resentment because of the encounter and the spate of cases that have destroyed many families. “We nurtured the BJP. It has now turned against us,” he argued. For many years, Rajputs were considered the BJP’s vote bank. This was primarily because the Congress was supported by Jats, who are seen as the community’s rivals, and because for decades the BJP was led by Shekhawat, the community’s idol, and prominent members of erstwhile royal families. Since his demise, Rajputs have felt marginalised by the BJP. This alienation and resentment has increased because the BJP under Vasundhara Raje has made grand overtures of friendship towards Jats, who are electorally more powerful than Rajputs. Some suspect stoking Rajput anger is part of the BJP’s strategy to distance itself from the community and, thus, snare the Jats into its fold. This theory is buttressed by the first list of candidates released by the BJP for Rajasthan earlier this week, which has 26 Jats compared to 17 Rajputs, a clear indication of the party’s preferences. BJP insiders believe Rajput anger would lead to counter-polarisation among Jats who are not just more in numbers but have far greater resources. On paper, this appears to be a fail-safe strategy. But, Jats are politically very sharp and are known to support the party that is most likely to win an election. If the BJP fails to emerge as a front-runner, Jats might desert the party and combined with the exodus of Rajputs inflict a deadly blow to Raje’s fortunes. There are 10 to 15 thousand Rajput voters in almost every constituency of Rajasthan. In western Rajasthan, they are a formidable electoral force because of higher concentration. The community also has the ability to work closely with smaller communities. In a close election, their loyalty could be decisive in at least three dozen constituencies in the 200-member Assembly. Aware of their electoral strength, Rajputs are now trying to rally behind Anand Pal’s wife Nirmal Kanwar, who, it is rumored, may contest either as an Independent candidate or with the support of BJP’s rivals from Ladnun, the gangster’s home turf.",2018-11-14,"Assembly Election 2018,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Congress,Hanuman Beniwal,Mit Shah,Narendra Modi,NewsTracker,PoliticalPlay,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Assembly Polls,Rajasthan Polls 2018,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan polls: Angered over gangster's encounter and miffed by Padmaavat slight, Rajput leaders vow to teach BJP lesson",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-angered-over-gangsters-encounter-and-miffed-by-padmaavat-slight-rajput-leaders-vow-to-teach-bjp-lesson-5551261.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The Congress on Wednesday alleged a ""Rs 8,935.61-crore scam"" in allotment of e-tendering contracts under the BJP's watch in Madhya Pradesh, which is going to polls on 28 November. Announcing that the Congress would probe the ""irregularities"" if voted to power, the party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the estimate of the scam could go up to ""Rs 50,000 crore"" after investigation. For its part, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) said the matter was being investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the state police. Surjewala claimed the Congress had in its possession documents pertaining to the alleged irregularities. ""We have documents of the e-tendering scam in which private companies were given contracts worth Rs 8,935.61 crore for various schemes of irrigation and other departments. Prima facie, the scam began in 2014,"" Surjewala told reporters in Indore. He alleged that the incumbent BJP government had hired a private company to develop an e-tendering software, which he said was ""tampered with"" to lower the value of the online bids quoted by select private companies so as to bring it on par with the lowest bids. ""These firms were then allotted the big-ticket government contracts,"" he alleged. Surjewala said, ""The value of the scam which has been executed through collusion between the government machinery and private companies could cross Rs 50,000 crore after a probe."" He said the role of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state Chief Secretary BP Singh was also suspect in the matter. ""The Congress was apprehensive that the computer hard disk and other evidence might be destroyed,"" he alleged. Terming the alleged scam ""an organised loot of public resources"", the Congress leader said his party would constitute a ""public commission"" to probe the matter. Responding to a query, Surjewala defended the Congress' poll promise to not allow holding of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) shakhas in government premises and cancel the order that allowed officers and employees to participate in shakhas. ""Congress feels that if a political organisation (Sangh) is allowed to use government offices then similar permissions will have to be given to the bodies associated with the Congress, the Left and other parties, which won't be proper,"" he said. The Congress leader also dismissed Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier's statement, denying any wrongdoing in the Rafale deal. The Congress has been alleging ""corruption and cronyism"" in the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France. The party has been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ""industrialist friends"" over the Rafale deal, calling it a ""scam"". The Centre has already denied the allegations of price escalation and favouritism. When contacted, Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesman Anil Soumitra said the e-tendering matter was being investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW). ""We are already probing the matter through the EOW.

Press Trust of India,": Former Sri Lankan cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan on Wednesday joined the party of Mahinda Rajapaksa, on a day when the premier's controversial government lost a no-confidence motion in Parliament. Dilshan, 42, became a member of Rajapaksa's newly-formed Sri Lanka People's Party (SLPP). The former Sri Lankan captain has obtained the SLPP membership, party secretary Sagara Kariyawasam announced. Dilshan is to run for a seat in Parliament from the southwestern Kalutara district, SLPP sources said. Rajapaksa was named by President Maithripala Sirisena as prime minister in October following the shock sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe as premier. After weeks of political turmoil in which Wickremesinghe refused to quit, Rajapaksa lost the trust vote earlier on Wednesday. A parliamentary election scheduled for January is now in doubt due to the supreme court's temporary order which overturned Sirisena's dissolution of the current parliament.

Press Trust of India," The colour pink may generally be associated with women, but in poll-bound Telangana, it has got opposition Congress up in arms against the Election Commission's move to opt for the colour on EVMs, saying pink was connected with the ruling TRS. Pink seems to 'give jitters' to the Congress as K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) uses it as the party's official colour scheme for all its promotional material. TRS leaders including Rao wear a pink scarf around their neck during party functions. On its part, the EC said that it was only going by laid down norms. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief spokesperson Dasoju Sravan sarcastically said, ""the EC seems to have been infected with some pink disease."" He alleged that EC represented by a deputy chief electoral officer issued orders for printing 90 lakh ballot papers in 'pink' colour. ""We openly raised red flag opposing the introduction of pink ballot papers that it would give an undue electoral advantage  to TRS."" ""However, the EC in Telangana has taken no action to stop those violations rather the aforesaid illegal decision is reinforced ignoring the open plea made by us,"" he said. There were representations to the EC from Congress not to use the colour apprehending it may influence voters towards the TRS party. Responding to the issue, chief electoral officer Rajat 
Kumar said the commission has decided to hold the elections with pink-coloured ballot papers posted on EVMs but the voter slips would be in white colour, according to the provisions of 
the Representation of People's Act. ""The Representation of the People Act has to be amended for changing the colour of the ballot paper,"" he noted. However, TRS has a reason for choosing Pink as its party's colour. TRS MP Vinod Kumar said pink represents peace and love and in 2001 when separate Telangana movement was started by 
KCR, they decided to use it for the same reason. Kumar claimed that a decision on the colours of ballot papers was taken in 1952 when Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister of the country. ""It was decided then that white would be used for Parliament and pink for Assembly ballot papers,"" Kumar told  .

Srinivasa Prasad,"In the middle of all the hue and cry over Rafale deal, the CBI-vs-CBI and RBI-vs-government, a quiet development missed the attention it deserved. Rahul Gandhi finetuned his soft Hindutva to a somewhat harder variety. What began as a relatively innocuous temple-hopping by Gandhi in last year’s Gujarat Assembly elections turned into a fervent zeal for  in Madhya Pradesh, which is going to polls on 28 November. The Congress’ election manifesto for the state promises not only  (cow shelters) in every panchayat but also the commercial production of cow urine and cow dung. Congress also vows to develop “Ram Van Gaman Path”, the route that Lord Ram supposedly took during his exile. This was a project that the state’s BJP government had mooted in 2007 but never fulfilled. It seemed to have dawned on the Congress president that if soft Hindutva didn’t deliver enough votes, a harder version might. Congress smuggled its promises about cows into the Madhya Pradesh manifesto, without shouting about it from rooftops. Also conspicuous was the absence of any tantrums from Left-leaning “intellectuals” who usually set Twitter on fire whenever a BJP leader utters a word beginning with 'c' or ending in 'w'. If Congress comes to power, Madhya Pradesh might have more shelters for cows than primary health centres for humans, but never mind that. Congress is bent upon tearing BJP to pieces about its Hindu appeasement but wants to do the very same thing and yet wants us to believe that it’s called secularism. It isn’t. It’s called wanting to have the cake and eating it too. But in doing all this, Congress has a problem. Rahul forgot to remind his satraps in Karnataka that Madhya Pradesh has an Assembly election and that he is trying to win over Hindu votes thereby promising to do the needful to cows. They needed their memory to be jogged. That’s because, while the Congress president was busy placating Hindus in Madhya Pradesh, his party’s luminaries in Karnataka were busy appeasing Muslims by celebrating Tipu Jayanti. You could argue that a political party could mollycoddle both Hindus and Muslims as well as people of any faith separately, but that’s clearly not BJP’s Hindutva which is what Congress is desperately trying to counter. But while trying to save his party from BJP’s Hindutva onslaught, Rahul himself suffers from bouts of amnesia. He forgot all about what he was trying to do in Madhya Pradesh when he decided to educate the nation with his thoughts on the Sabarimala controversy.  : “My personal view point on the issue of Sabarimala temple is that men and women are equal. All women should get permission to enter into the temple.” And his “personal view” is as different from the party’s official one in Kerala as green is from saffron. Congress in Kerala is competing with BJP in taking out   to oppose the 28 September Supreme Court verdict that said women of all ages could enter Lord Ayyappa’s shrine at Sabarimala. Like BJP, Congress also welcomed the court’s 13 November decision to review its verdict. These convolutions in Congress only prove one thing: the party is sure it must rig up an answer to BJP’s Hindutva but is baffled over how to do it. The absence of well-thought-out strategies leads to band-aid solutions. One such is what Rahul hit upon last year: hop from temple to temple and prove he was a   Hindu. Nobody apparently told him that BJP leaders didn’t visit temples and post pictures on Twitter. Hindutva is their core ideology. After critics poked fun at Rahul’s televised temple   during the Assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017 and in Karnataka in May 2018 and said his soft Hindutva could never match BJP’s hard variety, he seemed to agree. So he went on a 12-day “religious and spiritual journey’ to Kailash Mansarovar from 31 August, during which he announced to the world: This discovery by Gandhi looked more like a phony alternative to Darwin’s theories on universe than any startling religious epiphany. And he ended up looking more like a cock-a-hoop foreign traveller awestruck by the magnificence of trans-Himalayan heights than a diligent devotee. The Mansarovar trek may have toned up Rahul’s physique but produced no evidence of a political windfall. Tired of soft Hindutva, he then seemed to have decided to slowly ape the very same agenda of BJP that Congress had been opposed to. It’s doubtful if Hindu voters in Madhya Pradesh will desert BJP in droves to support Congress, but Rahul has no desire to be accused of not trying in case the party loses. In business, good companies are not just wary of imitation but even accept it as an inevitable risk and keep innovating. Consumers can usually tell a fake product from the real one. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are aware that BJP’s monopoly over Hindutva is too well recognised to be hijacked by competitors and know how to come with new ideas. What Rahul is not aware of is that while the electoral utility of the fake Hindutva of Congress is doubtful, it can even lead to confusion among people who have been hitherto supporting his party and are inimical to BJP. Congress leaders in Kerala “clarified” that Gandhi, despite his personal view supporting the entry of all women into the Ayyappa temple, had given “permission” to the state unit to oppose the very same. Senior leader Ramesh Chennithala said there was “no confusion” in Congress about this, but that’s exactly what there is: confusion among people. In contrast to this confusion, BJP knows where it stands with razor-sharp clarity. In comparison with Shah’s defiant, even if questionable, statement saying that Supreme Court “can’t give orders that can’t be followed”, the Congress’ stand looks like a tableau of comedy. And the reading public of both Kerala and Madhya Pradesh also can’t be unaware of the doublespeak of Congress evident from reports coming from Karnataka about Tipu Jayanti. For three years since 2015, the Siddaramaiah government of Congress celebrated Tipu’s birthday, as part of the chief minister’s carefully nurtured design to woo Muslims. Whether the 18th century ruler was a gallant warrior who fought the British or he was a bigot who converted Hindus to Islam or killed them should have been best left to historians to debate and decide, but this turned into a communal issue, giving BJP a handle to make it a life-and-death matter for Karnataka on par with poverty alleviation. Though Congress lost the election, the coalition government formed by that party and Janata Dal (Secular) continued the Tipu Jayanti this year, but on a low key. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S), who had opposed it in the past, made himself scarce, saying he was sick and needed rest in a resort. Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara too gave the event a miss, but many Congress leaders who attended it lauded Tipu in glorious terms that were, even by the standards of the party’s idolatry and sycophancy, would have embarrassed Tipu if he were alive. If the Congress’ appeasement of Muslims riled its ally JD(S) in Karnataka, its pampering of Hindus annoyed some of its partners in UDF in Kerala. And the party’s mixed-bag secularism is bound to send confusing signals to both Hindus and minorities elsewhere in India.",2018-11-14,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Hindutva,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Narendra Modi,Politics,Rahul Gandhi,Ramesh Chennithala,Sabarimala Temple Row","Rudderless on Hindutva and baffled on how to fight BJP, Congress sends mixed signals on Sabarimala, Tipu Jayanti",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rudderless-on-hindutva-and-baffled-on-how-to-fight-bjp-congress-sends-mixed-signals-on-sabarimala-tipu-jayanti-5551311.html,firstpost,-1,0

Parth MN,"Contrary to popular belief, Ajit Jogi and Mayawati’s alliance in Chhattisgarh is perhaps hurting the BJP as much as the Congress, if not more. The Satnamis, an influential community with the status of Scheduled Caste, and tribals form the core vote base of the Congress, for around 65 percent of the party’s vote comes from here. Former chief minister Ajit Jogi is extremely popular among the Satnamis, and Mayawati is a prominent Dalit leader in India. It is easy to deduct the two coming together would only eat into the Congress’ vote share. But a deeper look reveals something interesting. There are 10 seats in Chhattisgarh reserved for the Schedule Caste (SC) with great Satnami influence. In 2013, the Congress only managed to win one, while BJP took its tally up from five in 2008 to nine in 2013. Apart from the SC-reserved seats, there are 19 more seats in the general category with substantial Satnami voters. The BJP had bagged at least half of them too, proving critical crossing the halfway mark in a 90-member Assembly, which ended with BJP at 49 and Congress at 39. There is a back story about how the BJP made serious inroads in the Satnami-influenced seats. In 2008, 70-odd people from the Satnami sect were booked for attacking a police team at a fair in Bilaspur’s Bodasara. One of the 70 people was Bal Das, the priest of Satnami samaj. The fair was attacked, for it was organised on a property where the samaj believes its guru was born. Das demanded unconditional release, refusing to apply for bail, which led to the state government negotiating with him. Five years later, Das floated Satnam Sena and put up its candidates in 21 constituencies, only two of which were SC-reserved. Das campaigned vigorously in most of the constituencies, traveling from one place to another in a chopper, which is commonly rumoured to have been provided by the BJP state leadership. Das had, obviously, denied the charge, and had even said his party had nothing to do with BJP’s victory. Even though the Satnam Sena did not win a single seat, it managed to split the Congress vote, which ensured the BJP snuck through. For example, in the constituency of Lormi, which is a general seat in Mungeli district of Bilaspur division, Congress’ Dharmjeet Singh, who had been an MLA from the constituency from 1998, lost to BJP’s Lokesh Sahu by a margin of just over 6,000 votes. Satnam Sena’s Somesh Baba, son of Bal Das, polled more than 16,000 votes. BJP won 10 out of the 21 seats, where Satnam Sena had a candidate. Only two were SC-reserved. Out of the 10 constituencies that were SC-reserved, it is said that the BJP won nine seats largely because Jogi greatly influenced the Satnami vote against the Congress. He quit the Congress in 2015 after his brother Amit was expelled for anti-party activities, and in 2016, he formed his own party, Janata Congress Chhattisgarh. ""Even BJP didn’t expect to win as many seats,” said Sunil Kumar, editor of Raipur-based newspaper  . Five years down the line, there are two factors in this equation that go against the BJP. The Satnam Sena has been dissolved and Das is campaigning for the Congress. ""BJP is an anti-Satnami party,” said Ashok Sonwani, who had organised a rally for Das in Lormi. “We watched their work closely, and decided it is time for a change. We are now working hard to ensure a Congress victory,” adds Sonwani. Except their campaign is not even half as intense on the ground as opposed to what it was in 2013. Das' rally in Lormi was lukewarm. It had been organised on the day of a weekly bazaar to attract more crowd. But several people around the   had no clue what was going on. The votes that the Satnam Sena enjoyed in 2013, which helped the BJP, would be divided between Congress and the alliance between Jogi and Mayawati, for the community is displeased with Raman Singh for slashing the reserved quota for Scheduled Castes from 16 percent to 12 percent in 2013. The dedicated pupils of Das would be transferred to Congress, but slightly sceptical ones would prefer Jogi. This brings us to the second factor in the equation. Traveling through the SC-reserved seats, it appears that Jogi would get back the votes he influenced towards the BJP in 2013, and make it difficult for the ruling party to retain their hold there. Jogi's influence in the plains is as good as zero, and he has to capitalise on the SC seats to establish himself as a strong regional satrap. ""Jogi has to prove two points — one to Mayawati and another to Chhattisgarh,” said Sunil Kumar. Ruchir Garg, former journalist who joined Congress in October, said the Satnamis used to be a Congress vote bank but over the years BJP have also made their mark in the community. “In a way, it is now split in three parts,” he said. “Also, wherever Jogi has had his presence, he has only worked towards helping the BJP. He dented the Congress more when he was with the Congress,” says Garg. At 72, for a man who has been out of power for 15 years, Jogi’s campaign does not seem to have any roadblocks. He has been traveling from one constituency to another in his helicopter, raising questions over who is funding it. Kumar said there is a huge mining and industrial interest in Chhattisgarh. “These people do not only want the support of the government, but also a piece from the opposition,"" he said. A senior journalist based in Raipur anonymously said it is commonly believed in political circles that the BJP is funding Jogi-Mayawati campaign. “The nature of the alliance is designed to hurt the Congress,” he said, adding, “Which it is to an extent. But it could well backfire in the SC-reserved seats.” Ramnivas Tiwari, a senior leader of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, rubbished the claims. “We are contesting against the BJP, and are on our way to form the government by beating them,” he said, adding, “Jogi is a popular leader across the state. He has the support of the people and well wishers in every which way.” Whether the BJP is funding the alliance or not, it certainly hoped to gain from it. However, the situation on the ground would make the ruling party wonder if it misread the alliance and its impact.",2018-11-15,"Ajit Jogi,Ajit Jogi-Mayawati Alliance,Ashok Sonwani,Bal Das,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Congress,Dalit Seats,Dalit Voters,Janata Congress Chhattisgarh,Mayawati,PoliticsDecoder,Reserved Seats Chhattisgarh,Satnam Sena,Satnami,Scheduled Caste Seats In Chhattisgarh","Chhattisgarh polls: Ajit Jogi's hold on Satnamis poses equal threat for BJP, Congress as ex-CM gears up for final showdown",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-polls-ajit-jogis-hold-on-satnamis-poses-equal-threat-for-bjp-congress-as-ex-cm-gears-up-for-final-showdown-5553361.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rashme Sehgal,"Shashi Tharoor has emerged as not only one of our most eloquent parliamentarians but also an erudite author who has written a series of well researched and insightful books. His latest   provides insight into the enigmatic personality of our present Prime Minister Narendra Modi and just what makes him tick. In an interview, the Congress leader said that Modi's rule has been bad for India. ""...his inability to rise above his narrow-minded, mean-spirited, sectarian political origins to the levels of statesmanship and good governance that a country like India needs, that many hoped he could deliver and that he himself frequently had promised."" In 2014, when Prime Minister Modi had just been voted into a power, his liberal, inclusive and conciliatory pronouncements –  , for instance, and his promises to be a prime minister for all Indians – had prompted hope that we were possibly looking at a “Narendra Modi 2.0”: one who had moved away from his controversial role in the riots of 2002 and seemed ready to replace the incendiary identity politics of Hindutva with a politics of performance. In raising this possibility I also publicly pointed out that it was too soon to decide whether this was indeed the case. Within weeks my disenchantment set in, and within six months I had written of the central Modi paradox – making liberal statements while depending for political support on the most illiberal elements of Indian society. I was initially prepared to give him – and those who had voted for him – the benefit of the doubt, and I felt that if he lived up to his statements made during the election campaign and immediately after his victory, it could have benefited the nation. Unfortunately, the statements and promises turned out to be hollow and the book reflects my disenchantment with the gap between rhetoric and reality. In  , I judge Modi by the yardsticks that he had himself laid out by making such statements and claims. As he nears the end of his term as prime minister, the country is reeling on several fronts -- a fearful populace, an economy that has been hobbled by his foolhardy initiatives, a painful lack of jobs, a devastating number of farmer suicides, insecure borders, instability in Kashmir and the palpable failure in implementation of even laudable initiatives like   ,   and  . I don’t think   is an appropriate analogy. That was about a man who remains youthful and clean-visaged while a picture of him in the attic ages, reflecting his dissolution. Modi’s cynicism and insincerity are sadly not hidden in an attic. They are visible for all to see – as my book demonstrates. There are others as well, including accounts of Modi provided by close family members and early RSS colleagues. Part of the reason why I have included incidents and anecdotes from his personal life is that the prime minister is still seen in some quarters as an enigma—particularly with regard to his personal life and to a certain extent discussing, if not unravelling, some of these mysteries add colour to the narrative. But I have tried to be objective: His rise from very modest origins is admirable. I also defend his habits of personal grooming and his giving away his salary to charity. I have also praised the energy with which Modi jet-sets around the world. But at the same time, I have questioned the results of all of his personal qualities: how have they benefited the nation? I have also consistently (even in my criticism of Modi) tried to maintain a fairly reasoned and substantiated argument because I do understand that there may be an assumption that given that I am an Opposition MP I can only be critical. At the same time, however, I do have my own credibility as an analyst and writer to protect, and what my book seeks to do is to make a fair-minded and rational argument—I have actually laid out the yardsticks in terms of very specific things that he said he would do and he has not done. And I have gone through it in some detail with the wealth of evidence, research, facts and figures, anecdotes and footnotes. A quintessential paradox! On one hand, even critics of Modi have begrudgingly accepted that he is a workaholic with an ability to work harder than most of his compatriots. At the same time, this stands in stark contrast to his taste in personal luxury, with Mont Blanc pens, Bulgari designer glasses, Movado luxury watches and expensive jackets. While none of these are ‘sins’, as I point out, there are other traits – lack of emotional attachments, a streak of intolerance, narcissistic personality, assertive masculinity, controlling behaviour, and so on, which are reflective of how Modi meets many of the criteria that psychiatrists, psycho-analysts and psychologists have set up after years of empirical work on the authoritarian personality. He has most of the same mix of elements that Nandy describes -- all set within the matrix of some paranoid and obsessive personality traits. I lay them out for readers to see, without drawing any conclusion. I do blame those leaders, especially Advani, for creating the environment that led to the destruction of the masjid, but they claim that was an unintended consequence of the movement. We know for a fact that both Advani and Vajpayee have publicly expressed their regret at the events that led up to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us. But no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. He spent a lifetime in the RSS and has certainly been groomed in its beliefs. There is no question that he does share the Hindutva mindset and worldview. But there is more to him than Hindutva – a sort of personal aggrandisement, complete with a Modi personality cult featuring assiduous image-projection from Bal Narendra comic books to holograms, that makes “Moditva” more than just Hindutva. Again, to clarify yet again, the comparison is not of my own making. When I had brought it up, I had also clearly mentioned that I was, in fact, quoting what an unnamed RSS source had described to Vinod K Jose of   in an article published in 2012. The metaphor makes it clear that there is a certain element of frustration that the RSS has when it comes to dealing with the outsized cult of personality that surrounds Modi. Part of this frustration may also be a consequence of the differences between the doctrine of Modi, or Moditva, and the core principles of the Sangh Parivar. To take one example, Moditva has little patience for the economic autarchy traditionally espoused by RSS frontal organisations like the Swadeshi Jagran Manch. It seeks a globalised nation, deriving investment and profit from association with the wider world and allied with corporate interests within who share the same worldview. It derives legitimacy from evoking the glories of the past, but it seeks to update them with an eye on the future, reconciling Hindu temples with high-tech, marrying the ancient to the modern, and capturing futuristic technologies to serve its national mission. I say at one point that Moditva likes to project the image of a leader who can click a mouse with one hand while brandishing a   in the other! The RSS is unlikely to be comfortable with all that. Nor can they be happy with Modi’s abandonment of the self-effacing style the RSS requires you to cultivate. But they can neither remove nor attack Modi without threatening the basic Hindutva project. You will have to ask the RSS! It seems clear that they work very closely together and it is striking that the BJP cabinet ministers troop regularly to Nagpur like schoolchildren to get their report card from the headmaster. I think this offers a very interesting clue to the relationship shared between the RSS and the Modi-Shah duo. The latter know that they depend on the former for ideological authority and organisational strength: the BJP cadres are really largely RSS cadres. Yet the scorpion metaphor is also reflective of a certain frustration some in the RSS seem to have with the duo, arising from their inability to control them fully. I believe this is a reflection of a complex   that Modi shares with the RSS. On one hand, he has abandoned the personal restraint they would have expected from him when he was made prime minister and has an outsized personal ego that they struggle to reconcile with. At the same time, by initiating a practice of annual visits by his cabinet to Nagpur, where they report on their progress to senior  , he has also made an outward show of institutional supplication to the RSS. I don’t think that is a fair assessment of the performance of the Opposition in these last four years. On the contrary, I believe that we have actually succeeded in raising the consciousness of the nation (whether in Parliament or elsewhere) when it comes to the mistakes of the ruling dispensation as well as the dangers it poses by providing a free rein to incendiary communal elements in the country. From the Ramzadein-Haramzadein controvery, mob-lynchings, demonetisation and the botched implementation of GST to the Vyapam and Rafale scams, the Opposition’s criticism of the present government has covered a vast spectrum of topics -- foreign policy, economy and socio-cultural aspects -- and I think we have done a convincing job of highlighting the perils of giving the ruling party a second chance, in the upcoming General Elections. I think that the performance of the Opposition in state elections will tell you a different story. We have already seen the defeat of the RSS-BJP electoral machine in Karnataka and the results in Gujarat, though far from perfect, reflect a serious crisis of credibility in the ruling dispensation. I am also confident that the Opposition is likely to come back to power in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and offer a stiff contest in Chattisgarh. All of this has been possible because we have regained the trust of the people by offering a credible alternative to the polarising autocratic rule of the present ruling dispensation. The book is meant to be a substantive and substantiated takedown of four years of Modi rule and everything that has happened in that time. Therefore, in order to put forward the most comprehensive argument possible, it was important to touch on all aspects of the Modi government and not just repeat the ideological differences that one might have with the ruling dispensation. On the issue of foreign policy, I acknowledge that Modi has brought a significant new energy into India’s foreign policy, with his frequent trips to various countries across the world -- in his four years as prime minister, he has spent the equivalent of at least a year in other countries. On some specific policies, I have also applauded him -- I’ve acknowledged, for instance, that the International Yoga Day was a very clever exercise of soft power. But what has been the product of these visits? It would have been another matter if his extensive travels, the most by any Indian prime minister in history, had actually done the country much good. Sadly they have not. Our relationship with Pakistan is rocky, China is pushing us around, ties with the US are at a low ebb, Nepal mistrusts us and is moving towards China, the Maldives refuses new visas to Indians, and so on. Why did this happen? In a nutshell (and my book delves into this in more detail), during these years, while India had a prime minister who served as an energetic salesman abroad for the Government of India, it was also clear that his own credibility was increasingly under question. After all, how long can a salesman impress by the sheer force of his oratory and cleverly designed international photo-ops if the package he is selling is empty? Foreign policy was conducted episodically rather than coherently; there was a sense of rushing from speech to photo-op without either vision or sustained follow-up. Moreover, worryingly there was inevitably a justifiable fear among many of us that these visits are merely ‘feel good’ trips that mask growing troubles elsewhere and the serious lack of a cohesive foreign policy blueprint for the country. I do believe that the Indian voter—crippled by the twin disasters of demonestisation and GST, the lack of jobs, a weak rupee and fuel prices at an all-time high—is waking up to the realisation that the last four years have been the playground for   or false promises and the mandate offered to the present government in 2014 has been wasted. After all, why would a young man who voted for the BJP in 2014 believing that Modi  would get him a job, vote for Modi  again when he still has no job? As I have pointed out, the performances of the Opposition in recent by-elections and state elections have shown that there is certainly a groundswell that is developing against the current ruling dispensation. This is also reflected in the recent Lokniti-CSDS survey that predicts a loss of over 100 seats for the BJP in the 2019 General Elections. This realisation has permeated into the national consciousness in large part due to a united and spirited Opposition, one that is holding the government to serious standards of accountability for its failures.",2018-11-15,"Amit Shah,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Babri Masjid,Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao,Cow Vigilante,Demonetisation,GST,Hindutva,LK Advani,Rafale,Rahul Gandhi,Rath Yatra,RSS,Sangh Parivar,Skill India,Swachh Bharat,Swadeshi Jagran Manch,TheySaidIt,Vyapam","Narendra Modi's rule has been bad for India, says Shashi Tharoor; personality cult 'Moditva' scores over Hindutva",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modis-rule-has-been-bad-for-india-says-shashi-tharoor-personality-cult-moditva-scores-over-hindutva-5550191.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sandipan Sharma,"Two prominent BJP slogans have been missing from its ongoing campaign for five states — the promise of   and the dream of Congress-  Bharat. The reason for the BJP’s reluctance to reuse its popular   from previous elections is apparent: Elections for these states do not portend   for the party, and the Congress appears set for an impressive comeback instead of getting wiped out of India. According to CVoter, it might sweep Rajasthan, win Telangana and win Madhya Pradesh by a small margin. Even in Chhattisgarh, the Congress is locked in a close contest with a slight lead over the BJP that could be decisive. Just a few months ago, with the BJP decapitating its rivals ruthlessly in elections and the Modi-Amit Shah duo looking unassailable, who would have thought the Congress might be dreaming of a 4-0 win and the BJP would be fearing a wipeout? But, as Richie Benaud would have said, it’s all happening here. What should worry the BJP more is the fact that the Congress has done nothing spectacular to get within striking distance of a 4-0 lead in India's heartland. It has managed to claw back by the simple expedient of just being there while the BJP collapses under the weight of anti-incumbency and growing anger against its two chief ministers — Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Rajasthan, by electoral behaviour, is a state of extremes. Its impatient and fickle voters swing from one end of the spectrum to the other in almost every election, turning objects of their adulation into subjects of scorn and ridicule. But, the problem with the BJP in Rajasthan is that its government became extremely unpopular very early in its tenure. For almost three years, the buzz on the ground has been suggesting anger against the incumbent government and the chief minister for a variety of reasons — unkept promises, effete governance, concentration of power in the hands of a self-serving coterie and churn in caste equations. But, in spite of early warnings, the BJP could do nothing to stop its slide. Now,  , its vote share is likely to be eight percent less than that projected for the Congress. In addition, Raje's own popularity has fallen below Sachin Pilot's, who has the distinct disadvantage of not commanding a loyal support base of an influential caste or a cadre-based organisation like the RSS. The BJP had invested almost two decades in Raje. She is the party's most popular face in the stae and nobody else in the party has a pan-Rajasthan appeal. Her falling graph and projected loss imply the BJP will have to find new faces to lead the party in 2019 to neutralise the anger against Raje. If the BJP is still in the race in   and  , it needs to be more grateful to the Opposition than its own governments in these states. There is palpable anti-incumbency against Chouhan, reflected in the decline in his own popularity. Any other opponent would have harnessed it for electoral gains but the Congress got caught in infighting and failed to get its campaign off the ground for a very long time. This led people to doubt the Congress' ability to win the election, thus, activating the TINA (there is no alternative) factor in Chouhan’s favour. In Chhattisgarh, similarly, the BJP is still in the fight because of a division in the anti-government vote. Ajit Jogi and Mayawati are taking away a small but decisive chunk of votes away from the Congress, helping the BJP in a triangular contest. Had the Congress done something to address the Mayawati-Jogi problem, it would have started as a clear frontrunner in the state. All these states will be a big test for the prime minister's popularity. It is well established that the prime minister changes the electoral outcome with his big hitting in the end. But, the results have not been so spectacular whenever he has run into regional leaders with high popularity ratings, like in Bihar and Delhi in the past. In both Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia are gaining popularity in every successive pre-poll survey, taking clear and decisive leads over Raje and Chouhan. This means, people already see them as prospective chief ministers compared to the alternatives offered by the BJP. Dislodging them from popularity charts in an Assembly election will be a huge challenge for the prime minister. Also, voters in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are clear about their choice for the prime minister's post — most of them prefer Modi over Rahul Gandhi. This clarity in the voter's mind may be a blessing for the BJP in 2019. But this year, it could be a curse, since voters are likely to convince themselves that voting the BJP out in the Assembly elections won’t be an act of disloyalty if they support Modi in the Lok Sabha. This dichotomy of faith is summed up by a slogan reverberating in Rajasthan:   (No animosity with Modi but won’t spare Raje).",2018-11-15,"BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,InMyOpinion,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Narendra Modi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Vasundhara Raje",CVoter Survey: Assembly polls major test of Narendra Modi's popularity as Congress eyes 4-0 win ahead of 2019,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/c-voter-survey-assembly-polls-major-test-of-narendra-modis-popularity-as-congress-eyes-4-0-win-ahead-of-2019-5555461.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The revamp of the global tennis structure's second tier – the ATP Challenger Tour – from 2019 will hit Indian players hard with the complete removal of ATP ranking points in the lower level of the men's circuit, according to Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association's Sunder Iyer. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) events with prize money of USD 25,000 and below will offer no ATP ranking points from next year, according to the MSLTA's secretary. With there being no ranking points for USD 15,000 and below events for women too and points restricted to the last four in the higher USD 25,000 ITF events, the women players too will take a hit, Iyer indicated. ""Currently there are around 60 Indian men and women players who are ranked by the ATP and WTA. But next year, because of the revamp of the tennis structure, this would come down to less than 20,"" Iyer told PTI on Thursday. Countries and cities hosting tournaments will have to factor in higher costs to hold Challenger events as it will be a draw of 48, instead of the current 32, which will further inflate the budget as all 48 players in the main draw will have to be provided with hospitality and prize money, according to Iyer. ""This year we have three Challengers in India – the ongoing one at Bengaluru, the KPIT Pune Challenger and another one scheduled in Chennai in January, 2019. We are expecting two more to be added to the list,"" said Iyer. Iyer said the revamped global tennis structure was not to the benefit of Asian countries, including India, and this has led to the All India Tennis Association, which has over the years changed its domestic structure to host a lot of ITF events, to also go in for a revamp of the structure. ""I have been asked to head the task force to suggest the changes to the domestic tennis structure by the AITA by 15 December,"" Iyer said.",2018-11-15,"AITA,ATP,Bengaluru,International Tennis Federation,Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association,SportsTracker,Sunder Iyer,Tennis,WTA","Indian players to be hit hard after revamp of ATP Challenger Tour, according to MSLTA secretary Sunder Iyer",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/indian-players-to-be-hit-hard-after-revamp-of-atp-challenger-tour-according-to-mslta-secretary-sunder-iyer-5556771.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the Congress and other opposition parties were grappling with a credibility crisis in poll-bound Chhattisgarh with people losing faith in them. The home minister, who is scheduled to address rallies on Thursday ahead of the second phase of polls on 20 November, also said the number of districts under the grip of Naxalism had come down from 90 to about 10-11. ""Naxal menace is on the wane. Earlier, around 90 districts were under the grip of Naxalism but the number has now come down to 10-11 districts...The menace will be wiped out of the country in next three to five years,"" he told reporters while issuing an appeal to Naxals to shun violence and join the mainstream. According to the minister, the Congress had not projected a chief ministerial candidate in the state because it was facing a credibility crisis. Other opposition parties are also grappling with the same problem, he added. ""The manifesto released by the Congress is an admission that the party has lost its credibility. Its manifesto is as meaningless as a post-dated cheque in a bank that is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is meaningless,"" Singh said. The party, he added, had completely lost its ""coherent strength"". Questioned on the non-payment of bonus to grain producing farmers by the state government, he said, ""It is true that bonus was not paid to farmers for a couple of years due to certain circumstances. But as the Chhattisgarh government has paid the bonus this year, it will continue in the future as well."" However, he did not specify why the government failed to pay bonus to farmers.

Press Trust of India,": The State Backward Class Commission report on Maratha reservations and the drought in 151 talukas are expected to dominate the two-week long winter session of the Maharashtra Legislature set to begin on Monday. The winter session, being held in Mumbai after 57 years, will have only eight working days and will end on 30 November. A decision on whether proceedings of the House would be held on Guru Nanak Jayanti on 23 November will be decided later. The State Backward Class Commission submitted its 200-page report on Maratha reservations on Thursday and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis stated later in the day that all statutory formalities in connection with it would be completed in 15 days. Sources, however, said a decision on whether the report will be tabled on the floor of the Legislature is yet to be taken. In August this year in a televised address during the peak of the Maratha quota protests, Fadnavis had said that once the report of the commission was submitted, a special session of the state legislature would be convened within a month to pass a ""law or resolution"" regarding granting reservations to the community. On Thursday in Akola, Fadnavis said his government has already declared it would expedite the Maratha reservation issue by November end. Nearly half a dozen MLAs had announced their resignations from the Legislature during the peak of the Maratha reservation stir. Only Shiv Sena's Harshvardhan Jadhav, though, submitted his resignation to Speaker Haribhau Bagade. Disgruntled BJP MLA Ashish Deshmukh also quit the House. The prevailing drought in several parts of the state is also expected to be at the centre of acrimonious debates between the government and the Opposition in the Assembly and Legislative Council. The Opposition has already been in attack mode on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement, made during a rally in Shirdi, that 16,000 villages in the state were now drought-free. The Opposition has claimed findings of the Groundwater Survey And Development Authority (GSDA), on the other hand, show that groundwater levels have depleted by more than one metre in 13,984 villages in 252 out of the 353 tehsils in the state. Of the 13,984 villages, groundwater levels have gone down by more than 3 metres in 3,342 villages, by 2-3 metres in 3,430 villages and by 1-2 metres in 7,212 villages, the GSDA report states. While the state government has been claiming that Jalyukt Shivar, a water conservation scheme, is a success, the opposition Congress and NCP have called it a plan beset by corruption. Another issue that is expected to generate heat is the killing of tigress Avni. The tigress, who had allegedly killed 13 people in Yavatmal district's Pandharkawda area in the last two years, was shot dead by a marksman hired by the state government in a forest in Yavatmal on 2 November. The BJP-led government in the state has come under fire over the killing of the tigress who left behind two 10-month-old cubs. The killing led to an outrage among animal lovers and wildlife organisations which accused the state government of violating norms. The state government set up a four-member committee to probe the killing. A post mortem report has revealed that the tigress was shot while she was facing away from the shooter and it has also raised doubts on the way the tranquiliser dart was administered. While Union Minister Maneka Gandhi called the killing a ""ghastly murder"" and demanded that state Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar be sacked, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has dubbed the probe committee a ""farce"". Mungantiwar and the state government have, however, defended it, calling the incident ""sad"" but necessary after the tigress had attacked forest staff trying to tranquilise it. The post of Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council is vacant after the tenure of Congress' Manikrao Thakare ended. The BJP is now the single largest party in the Council with 22 seats and it remains to be seen whether it will seek removal of Council Chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar who belongs to the NCP, or if it will settle for the deputy chairman's post. Nine new bills, including GST amendments, caste validity for contesting gram panchayat polls, and another amendment regarding cooperative housing societies will be tabled in the winter session. Apart from these, there are eight pending bills awaiting clearances from either of the two Houses and six ordinances waiting for passage on the floor of both the Houses.",2018-11-16,"BJP,Devendra Fadnavis,Maharashtra Legislative Assembly,Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Winter Session,NewsTracker","Maharashta Legislative Assembly: Winter Session set to commence on Monday; drought, Maratha quota to dominate proceedings",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/maharashta-legislative-assembly-winter-session-set-to-commence-on-monday-drought-maratha-quota-to-dominate-proceedings-5561161.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ratan Sharda,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had sparked a new hope for the post-Independence generation. It was a short-lived dream, one that had promised a revolution. In fact, Arvind Kejriwal had borrowed from Jai Prakash Narayan ’s phrase and called for ‘Sampoorna Kranti’. AAP was an off-shoot of one of the most aggressive and ambitious anti-corruption drives in this country — India Against Corruption (IAC). However, with AAP's change in stature from an organisation with ‘stars-in-the-eyes’ to a run-of-the-mill political party, another dream was shattered. The first such movement that had raised the hopes of the previous generation was the 1973-1975 period, prior to Emergency. From the dark period of Emergency, rose the Janata Party in 1977 as a climax of that ‘Samagra Kranti’ call of Jai Prakash It was the first non-Congress government of independent India with great promise, but it splintered into oblivion, frustrating a genuine people’s movement. It took nearly three decades for people to forget that experiment as a bad dream and put their faith in IAC, a non-political movement that morphed into a political party. This would turn out to be one of the biggest betrayals of modern India: While the Janata Party was a formation of seasoned politicians from across the spectrum who rode on a popular anti-corruption movement of youth, AAP was a genuinely fresh start and the USP of the party was its leadership that had risen from the ground without any previous political baggage or experience. So what went wrong? As a young Maharashtrian NGO worker would later ask Mayank Gandhi: “  (what happened)?” This question resulted in the book   from the man who was in the midst of it all, who had worked from the ground right up to the top decision-making bodies of the IAC and AAP. It is commendable that Mayank Gandhi has looked at the entire movement and its history with a detachment rare for someone who was part of it all  — from the euphoric highs to the lows of backroom cloak-and-dagger politics. It is not easy to be objective — not just in accepting one’s mistakes — but also in looking at those of others'  in a detached manner (or with ‘  as Gandhi would put it). I don’t know Mayank Gandhi well enough. I have looked at the AAP movement as a political observer since the IAC days. So I cannot vouch for everything he has recorded. But the way in which he recounts the events with the requisite references, one is inclined to believe his narrative. Readers will be delighted by the sudden sparks of humour inserted by Gandhi amid the narrative of dire and depressing incidents, as also his penchant for picking out apt quotes, and pithy phrasing. One thing that stands out is how we Indians long for a hero, a knight in shining armour who can save us from our problematic issues.  We are so besotted by such personalities when they rise, that we refuse to see the chinks in their armour. Gandhi too overlooked the unscrupulous actions of Arvind Kejriwal and his coterie, believing the ultimate good would far outweigh these. He writes, “Deep within, I knew that I could be the latest victim of Arvind’s use-and-throw policy. That didn’t worry me deeply — the nation and this uprising that could steer it in the right direction came first (Page 98)."" Then, on page 106, he says, “I had an uneasy feeling that we were being manipulated – but by whom? – Anna or Arvind?” At one place Mayank admits about the first AAP government in Delhi, “AAP consisted of a bunch of activists; these were system-breakers and not system-makers… Our task was to push for development, but we were masters of confrontation (Page 146-147)."" It is striking how intelligent men close their eyes when conspiracies are framed and one of their own colleagues is eased out or thrown out of the group. Not once, but time and again! It is the classic case of people believing that the man-eater would leave them alone if they offer a sacrificial goat. It reminds one of a folk story where villagers send out one of their own to the ogre in the jungle believing that they would be spared. This is the most saddening lesson: that even seasoned, intelligent individuals can fall for this trap and give up on ethics. Gandhi has been unsparing in what he has to say about his erstwhile friends from the AAP, and brutally honest in tracing the party's unravelling — from its ambitious national-level beginnings to being reduced to a typical, immoral Delhi-centric entity. Gandhi also goes onto suggest how AAP can regain its élan and become an alternative political force. Apart from Kejriwal, the book presents an unflattering picture of Anna Hazare as well. I knew he was gullible, manipulated by Kejriwal and his group. But I didn't imagine him to be quite so whimsical and petty. The pettiness of the supposedly wise men leading the new revolution is very hard to believe, but there you are. People worship their idols from afar, only to discover they have feet of clay, on approaching closer. AAP is no exception. The scales fall from your eyes as you read about so many of the ‘intellectual’ opinion leaders exposing themselves as selfish and petty. I have seen very few leaders who only gain in stature and respect the more you get to know them. Most of them are RSS leaders I've interacted with. I recall a few Sarvodaya leaders, and socialist leaders like George Fernandes, who I met in time at the time of the infamous Emergency of 1975. On 7 February 2015, I wrote an article after AAP's victory in the Delhi elections, titled – “ ?”. I noted, “Arvind Kejriwal who was at the right place at the right time in Delhi can, therefore, actually become relevant to national politics by occupying the left space in true and honest sense.  Provided he has perseverance and patience, and the media doesn’t turn him into another short-lived charmer like VP Singh.” Mayank Gandhi’s book tells us why Kejriwal couldn’t become the true alternative. The indecent hurry, the urge to take short-cuts and finally becoming a caricature of the politicians he hated (and had made people hate). The holier-than-thou individual turned out to be a sinner. One must thank Mayank Gandhi for taking the pains to write such an absorbing, objective story of the meteoric rise of AAP, the loss of its moorings and speedy unravelling.

Press Trust of India,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi Friday termed demonetisation as the biggest scam in the history of independent India, adding it would be proved that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ""robbed the poor of their hard-earned money and given it away to a few rich"". Addressing a campaign rally for the 28 November Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls, Gandhi said Modi does not talk about being a ""chowkidar (watchman) of the country and of tackling corruption. ""If Modi says he is a chowkidar, people will respond that chowkidar chor hai,"" he said, addressing a rally at Deori in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh.

FP Staff,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, while addressing an election rally at Ambikapur in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, attacked the Congress, claiming that they still cant accept that a 'chaiwala' (tea-seller) became the prime minister and challenged them to make someone outside the Gandhi family the party president.  “These people still have not come to terms that I am the prime minister, it has been nearly four and a half years. They are still crying, how can a 'chaiwala' become a prime minister? Now they say a 'chaiwala' became the prime minister because of one great person,” Modi said. On Wednesday, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, taking a jibe at Modi, had credited India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru of creating democratic institutions that enabled a 'chaiwala' to become the prime minister of the country. Modi, while addressing the rally, claimed that he wanted to challenge the party, stating that he would agree to Nehru creating a 'truly democratic system' only if they let some good leader of Congress outside of the family become the party president for five years. ""Four generations of Congress ruled the nation and they should give an account of what they have done for the country,"" Modi said. ""People have disproved that it was the ""right of only one family"" to speak from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi,"" he said. ""You can't understand the difficulties faced by the poor but a 'chaiwala' can,"" Modi said. ""They (Congress) have kept the country in the dark with their lies which are ingrained in their minds,"" Modi said, not mincing words to target the principal opposition party and its top leaders. Modi made sure to praise his own party claiming that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the only party ruling without discrimination. ""The BJP is the only party in the country that is working towards ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ without any discrimination,” he said.  Talking about witnessing the development in the state, Modi said, “On one side there is fear being created of bombs and guns. People are being lead to death and efforts were being made to throttle democracy. But on the other hand, the people of Chhattisgarh have proved the strength of India's democracy by overwhelming polling in the first phase.” Appreciating the people of Bastar for voting despite facing the threat of democracy, he said, “Shouldn't people of Bastar be appreciated for such high voting percentages? I will tell you a way to appreciate them, on 20 November you register even higher voting percentage than Bastar.” Modi urged the people to vote in heavy numbers to ensure BJP’s victory and as an appreciation of the efforts taken by the people of Bastar who voted despite facing the threat of Naxalism. Modi also recalled Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s contribution to Chhattisgarh, pointing out the ""mess"" that  Congress created at the rime of formation of Telangana. “Vajpayee created Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It was a peaceful division and both the states are developing rapidly today. But just look at what the mess Congress created at the time of formation of Telangana,” he said.

Press Trust of India," Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said the Congress president's failed politics is compelling him to resort to 'falsehood' and 'petty hair-splitting' to make the sensitive Rafale purchase defence deal controversial. Jaitley also said that it was the Congress-led UPA which delayed the purchase of the Rafale aircraft which was necessary to improve the combat ability of Indian Air Force. He was responding to allegations made by Gandhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has admitted to ""theft"" in the Rafale deal before the Supreme Court and to changes in the contract without asking the Air Force. In a series of tweets, Jaitley said that 'falsehood' cannot be a substitute for ""failed politics"" of Gandhi. ""UPA delayed the Rafale purchase, much required for improving the combat ability of Indian Air force. Is Rahul Gandhi's failed politics compelling him to render India's sensitive defence requirements controversial?"" Jaitley questioned. The Centre on Monday disclosed to the Supreme Court the pricing details for the 36 Rafale jets that were negotiated on ""better terms"" and said it ""completely followed"" the Defence Procurement Procedure laid out in 2013 and secured the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) approval before the deal that has whipped up a political storm was inked with France.

Karishma S," Jay Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS), a revolution of ideologies, started gaining momentum a few months ago with the leadership of Hiralal Alawa, a former rheumatologist from AIIMS Delhi, who actively spoke for tribal welfare in the reserved constituency of Dhar. However, the momentum came to a standstill after Alawa joined the Congress and filed his nominations from Manawar Assembly constituency on 9 November. Alawa was accompanied by Congress stalwart Digvijaya Singh, who flew in from New Delhi to show his support and calm down rebel candidates coming out strongly against an outside candidate. A Congress ticket to Alawa, while sidelining local candidates who had worked for the party, shocked everyone. While organising rallies and gatherings across Madhya Pradesh, Alawa had claimed that he would fight for the rights of the tribals by contesting 40 reserved constituencies across the state, independently. He, however, joined Congress, leaving JAYS divided into two groups. Some JAYS seniors in the organisation claim that this is not a political outfit but a social organisation, and the ones who want to make it political, will be automatically terminated from the organisation based on the pre-decided guidelines. Those who support Alawa, however, think that change can only be brought by contesting elections and making an ‘Adivasi Sarkar’. In a freewheeling chat with   for  Alawa opens up on JAYS and his political career. JAYS is a revolution and it will always go on. Accepting a ticket from Congress party doesn’t mean that my thinking has changed. I was the one who made JAYS and its remote control is with me. Although I cannot participate in rallies and gatherings, I will always support the people. There are some differences of opinions and the JAYS members who were also trying to get a ticket from different constituencies of Dhar district are offended. It was very difficult to get a ticket while tackling nepotism, groupism etc. and being chosen by the party from a list of local leaders from the area. I was not even a member of Congress then. Now that I have bagged the ticket, next is winning the seat. Joining Congress does not mean I have changed my decision and don’t want to work for the welfare of the tribals. That is the reason why I wanted to enter into politics in the first place. That will be my agenda always. JAYS members have every right to do whatever they want. They would have received my support had they contested from these constituencies. They, however, chose to support me instead. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary, Digvijaya Singh, had come to Manawar, where he made a promise in front of everyone to work for the tribals of the state. “Adivasiyo ka hit hi Congress ka hit hai,” he had said. The local Congress leaders who had worked in the area and expected a ticket felt bad after being denied a ticket from Manawar. Singh’s visit helped us a lot in striking a balance with the other Congress workers in the area. Like Digvijaya Singh said, “Many candidates had asked for a ticket from this seat but keeping in mind the favorable conditions for the party, the ticket was given to Alawa. This is not a fight of a candidate but that of ideology.” I believe in what he said. I think all these are rumours spread by the people who are jealous of me. Nothing of that sort has happened. Congress gave me a ticket because they were 100% sure that I will be able to bag the seat. About JAYS, it is a social group and we have our differences, but we respect one another. This was not right. He was promised a ticket by party seniors and at the last moment was denied. I spoke to all the senior leaders and told them about my views on this. I was promised by them that they would consider giving him some position in the government. I have not quit being a part of JAYS. Like I said, JAYS is not a political party, it is an organisation of ideologies and I will always be a part of it. When I told them that I was joining Congress, they were happy because we all needed someone who could represent us at Vidhan Sabha. I am sure that with the help of tribals, I will be able to bag the seat. All the promises that I had made to the tribals while campaigning for JAYS will all be fulfilled once I win from this seat. My focus will be unemployment, migration of young talents from these districts, education, health facilities, forest rights and PESA. Because of the lack of proper educational institutions in these districts, the youngsters are forced to go to other cities, I will make sure that really good institutes set their base here. I will also work for the development of a medical institute here. We will work for the upliftment of tribals and towards resolving their displacement problems.",2018-11-13,"Anand Rai,Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Dhar,Digvijaya Singh,Hiralal Alawa,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Politics,Rahul Gandhi,VeryCloseUp,Vyapam","Madhya Pradesh polls: Will bag Dhar seat, says Congress' Hiralal Alawa as party workers fume over ticket to 'outsider'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-polls-will-bag-dhar-seat-says-congress-hiralal-alawa-as-party-workers-fume-over-ticket-to-outsider-5544251.html,firstpost,-1,0
Vandana Agrawal," In Chhattisgarh, the electorate enthusiastically voted for ‘None of the Above’ candidates, so much so that NOTA has become some kind of a threat to political parties in the fray. Chew on this: Chhattisgarh was in the news for polling the maximum number of NOTA votes in the 2013 Assembly election, with NOTA even playing spoilsport for candidates on many seats. It was the year when the option was first introduced on the electronic voting machines (EVMs) by the Election Commission. In 2013, NOTA was at the third position in 35 of the 90 Assembly seats. Considering that the difference in vote percentage between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress was only 0.75%, and that NOTA got 3.16% of votes which means, NOTA got four times more votes than the difference of defeat. Looking at the data of the previous Lok Sabha election, NOTA got a thumping response in the tribal-dominated areas of Chhattisgarh, with the option securing third place in five of 11 such seats. In he Maoist-affected Bastar, for instance, 38,772 voters preferred NOTA over Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Soni Sori, who got only 16,903 votes. Similarly in Kanker, 31,917 voters opted to press NOTA button, and in chief minister Raman Singh's home district Rajnandgaon, 32,384 people chose NOTA. The second phase of polling for the 2018 Chhattisgarh Assembly election is only a few days away. The BJP and the Congress are not the prominent parties in the poll arena this time. There is a formidable third front of former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) is also in the fray. Then there are the smaller or new parties in the battle, such as the AAP, the Marxist Communist Party and the Gondwana Republican Party. Yet, the concern of political parties in many areas is more closely related to NOTA. This is because there were seven seats in the previous Assembly election where NOTA got more votes than the difference of defeat between candidates. Apart from this, there were 10 seats where NOTA got over 5,000 votes. Yogendra Yadav, an election analyst and president of Swaraj India party, explains this by saying that “people are looking for an alternative which is not available, so they are heading towards NOTA”. “People stood in line and did not hesitate to vote for NOTA and this shows a deep disappointment towards our politicians,” he adds. Three years ago, during the byelection for the Assembly seat of Antagarh in Chhattisgarh, voters picked NOTA as their second choice. According to the result of the bypoll, BJP candidate Bhojraj Nag got 63,616 votes, while the number of voters who pressed NOTA was 13,506. Rupadar Poudo, the only rival of Nag, from Ambedkarite Party of India, got 12,086 votes and was at number three position. The impact of NOTA in Chhattisgarh can be ascertained by the result on some seats. Rampukar Singh, minister in the previous Ajit Jogi government, won the Pathalgaon seat in 2003 with a thin margin of votes against BJP's Vishnudev Sai. In the next election in 2008, Singh won again, getting 64,543 votes against Sai’s 54,627. But in 2013, NOTA played spoiler. Singh got 67,576 votes, while BJP's Shivshankar Painkra got 71,485 votes. Singh lost by 3,909 votes while NOTA got 5,533 votes! In Dharasinva in 2008, BJP's Devji Bhai Patel won the seat and then again in 2013, but NOTA reduced his victory margin from 6,339 to 2,390. NOTA got 3,740 votes. Similarly in 2008, BJP's Nandkumar Sahu won Raipur Rural by 2,979 votes. He was fielded again by the BJP in 2013 but NOTA got 3,524 votes. Sahu lost to Congress candidate Satyanarayan Sharma by 1,861 votes. On Kawardha seat, the chief minister’s home district, BJP's Siyaram Sahu won by 10,408 votes in 2008. In 2013, over fears of anti-incumbency wave, the party fielded Ashok Sahu. NOTA bagged 9,229 votes and Ashok won, but with a victory margin of just 2,558. Experts believe that if the BJP had not changed the candidate, they would have lost the seat. In 2008, BJP's Komal Janghel won the Khairagarh seat by 19,544 votes. She was fielded again in 2013, against Girvar Janghel of the Congress. In a tough battle, NOTA got 4,643 votes and Janghel was defeated by 2,190 votes. BJP's Kheduram Sahu won by 9,407 votes in the 2008 Assembly elections from Dongargaon seat. In 2013, Dinesh Gandhi contested on the BJP ticket and lost to Congress' Dalheshwar Sahoo by 1,698 votes. Here, NOTA had got 4,062 votes. In Dantewada, Congress' Devati Karma had won by 5,987 votes, but there were 9,677 people who voted for NOTA. In the same way, Congress's Mohan Marakam in Kondagaon won by 5,135 votes, while 6,773 people preferred NOTA. In Chitrakot constituency coming under the Maoist-hit Bastar, Congress's Deepak Baij got a total of 50,303 votes while the people had given 10,848 votes in the favour of NOTA. In the previous Assembly election, Congress candidate Mohammad Akbar, who lost Kawardha seat by 2,558 votes, blamed the electronic voting machine for his defeat. He believed that reversing the voting machine had confused voters, so much so that he has now requested the Election Commission to ensure that the machine is kept in an ‘upside’ position this election. According to Akbar, his name was at the top of the voting machine, but where the machine was kept in a ‘downward’ position, his name came down, and on top was the NOTA button. The people were told that they could choose to vote for Akbar by pressing on the first top button on the machine, so they ended up pressing the NOTA option. Yet another explanation for too many votes for NOTA was offered by CPI candidate Manish Kunjam from Konta Assembly seat. “In tribal-dominated areas, there is little awareness about the voting machine, and the number of people who press the first or last button on the machine is high. If ballot paper is used for voting, you will not see NOTA figuring anywhere,” Kunjam says. BJP spokesman Sanjay Srivastava says that since NOTA was added as an option for the first time in 2013, the effect was seen in the immediate election. “Out of curiosity, people pressed the NOTA button. But this time it will not happen,” he insists. For Subrata Sahu, Chief Electoral Officer, Chhattisgarh, the matter of NOTA is of no concern. “Whichever candidate the voter chooses, or whether he or she presses the button for NOTA, it is their discretion,” he says.",2018-11-13,"AAP,Ajit Jogi,Bastar,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,ConnectTheDots,CPI,Election Commission,EVM,Gondwana Republican Party,Kawardha,NOTA,Rajnandgaon,Raman Singh,Soni Sori","Chhattisgarh polls: Not rivals, candidates fear NOTA may emerge biggest slayer in repeat of 2013 nightmare",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-polls-not-rivals-candidates-fear-nota-may-emerge-biggest-slayer-in-repeat-of-2013-nightmare-5544101.html,firstpost,-1,0

Asked about attempts being made by Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, N Chandrababu Naidu and Mamata Banerjee respectively, to cobble together anti-BJP fronts and if a 'mahagatbandhan' (mega alliance) would become a reality, he said ""it will."" Political parties would be able to iron out their differences for this purpose, he said. ""More than the attitude of the leaders, it is the people from the ground who will push all the leaders to come together to save India. And it will happen,"" Yechury said. He said it was important for all secular-minded parties who value Indian democracy, the Indian republic and unity of the people to come together in defense of the country, and on that basis, to create a better India. ""That is the objective that both Stalin and I share along with all other leaders... we have a common objective and this is going to be done along with all the other secular democratic forces in the country,"" he said. ""We are all together on this one issue of saving India today, saving Indian institutions, saving India's constitutional order, saving the unity, integrity and harmony of our people,"" Yechury added. Asked if his party would be a part of an alliance whose constituents could be the Trinamool Congress or Congress, the veteran Communist leader said ""alliances in India have and will always take place primarily at the state level first."" ""Then on that basis, the national alliance will emerge,"" he said, adding ""things happen only after elections"" at the national level, indicating at the possibility of a post-poll arrangement. The CPM leader   that BJP was damaging and destroying the country's institutions. ""The role of top BJP leadership in damaging and destroying the country's institutions is unparalleled in India's history. This is needed to further the RSS's unconstitutional agenda. Their nefarious designs have to be, and will be defeated,"" Yechury had tweeted. ""That the CBI is particularly under the spotlight should not surprise us. After all, it was the agency investigating the BJP party president for a very serious charge. No prizes for guessing how and why his name was 'cleared' under a dark cloud,"" he had alleged. Yechury had alleged that a number of ""compromised officials"" with dubious records were inducted into top agencies in the past four years.

Press Trust of India," Congress leader Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday alleged that the Nehruvian legacy was being ""undermined"" by those presently in power who have ""contempt"" for the country's first prime minister for all that he did to build an India which they want to change for the ""worse"". Speaking at an event to relaunch Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's book  , the former Congress president said Jawaharlal Nehru, as India's first prime minister, ""consolidated democracy and entrenched the basic values of India's polity — values to which we are still proud to lay claim."" ""What are these values? Shashi Tharoor summarises them as the core pillars of Nehruvianism — democratic institutional building, staunch pan-Indian secularism, socialist economics and foreign policy of non-alignment. These values were integral to a vision of Indianness that is fundamentally being challenged today,"" she said on the eve of Nehru's birth anniversary. But, that vision remains at the core of ""our time-tested beliefs"", Gandhi said. ""We all know, as Shashi Tharoor has just said, that this precious legacy is being undermined daily by those who rule us today. They express disdain and contempt for Nehru for all that he did to build the India they are bent upon changing for the worse,"" Gandhi said. She further said, ""Today, we must honour him by fighting with determination to safeguard our democracy against those who are undermining it."" Tharoor, in his remarks at the event, lauded Nehru for strengthening democratic institutions and always encouraging ""constructive criticism"". Narrating an anecdote, Tharoor said Nehru was asked by an American editor as to what he wanted his legacy to be, to which the first Indian prime minister said: ""330 million people capable of governing themselves."" ""A number of post-colonial heroes in other ex-colonies had gone the opposite way. They started off as democratically popular heroes and headed in an authoritarian direction...Nehru ji never fell into that trap."" ""So if today, we have a chaiwala as prime minister, it is because Nehruji made it possible to create the institutional structures through which any Indian can aspire to and rise to the highest office in the land,"" the MP from Thiruvanathapuram said. Talking in detail about the four Nehruvian pillars, Gandhi said democracy could not have been taken for granted in 1947 that a country beset by acute poverty and torn apart by partition would become or remain democratic. It was Nehru who instilled a democratic culture in our country by his regard for democracy, she said. Nehru's regard for Parliament, his regard for the independence of the judiciary, his curtesy to those of different political convictions, his commitment to free elections, his faith in a free press and his deference to institutions over individuals — have all left a precious legacy of freedom, Gandhi said. On Nehru's commitment to secularism, Gandhi said he strived to prevent partition, but when it occurred, he never accepted that since Pakistan had been ostensibly created for Indian Muslims, what remained was a state for Hindus. His life-long conviction was that India belonged to all its people and the majority community have a special obligation to protect the rights and promote the well-being of India's minorities, she said. In both policy and personal practice, Nehru stood for an idea of India that embraced every religion, caste ethnicity and language, Gandhi asserted. Talking about Nehru's idea of socialism, she said: ""It is fashionable today to decry Nehruvian socialism as a system that tied India to many years of modest growth. This does not take into account the circumstances of the early years of independence when massive infrastructure was needed to be built up."" On his foreign policy of non-alignment, Gandhi said Nehru was a ""convinced internationalist"". The Nehruvian vision was about safeguarding India's independence and self-respect against a potential encroachment on its sovereignty that still lies at the heart of the Indian National Congress, she said. Gandhi highlighted that over the years Congress governments have taken Nehru's idea forward and cited the examples of Panchayati Raj and the Right to Information Act. ""They have defended secularism in the face of violent threats to our nation's diversity,"" she said. Tharoor said a concerted campaign of vilification, calumny and an astonishing amount of lies was being spread on the internet against Nehru. ""If today, the government can boast about Mangalyaan, ask who created ISRO. Who decided that even a poor Indian can dare to aim for the skies. Who created the IITs who send so many bright young men to the Silicon Valley."" ""All of this in the poor country was optional. You had to have the vision to say we need to do all these things. We need to lay the foundations to build India of the future,"" Tharoor said.",2018-11-13,"BJP,Congress,India,Jawaharlal Nehru,Politics,Rahul Gandhi,Shashi Tharoor,Sonia Gandhi,TheySaidIt",Nehruvian legacy being undermined by those who have 'contempt' for India's first prime minister: Sonia Gandhi,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/nehruvian-legacy-being-undermined-by-those-who-have-contempt-for-indias-first-prime-minister-sonia-gandhi-5544781.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday promised to install a ""people's government"" in Chhattisgarh and accused the ruling BJP of destroying the state in its 15-year rule. Addressing a rally for the second phase of polling in the state, Rahul said it was among the richest in the country in terms of water, forest, mines and minerals. ""But, people have remained poor due to the policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government,"" he charged. Invoking his family ties with the state, the Congress chief said the relationship was of love and not politics. He claimed that lands of locals in this part of the tribal-dominated state were taken away to set up industries. But when the units were not set up, the lands were not returned to the people. ""The Congress will install a people's government in the state which will empower farmers, small and medium businesses and provide employment to the youth,"" Rahul said. He said if the Congress came to power in the state, it would enforce the Land Acquisition Act and facilitate loan waiver for farmers, besides providing them bonus and Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. Accusing the Raman Singh government of being involved in graft, Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not uttered a word about corruption in Chhattisgarh. ""People of the state have suffered because of this,"" he alleged. ""I do politics for the rights of poor, farmers and youth. I will not protect 10-15 industrialists at their cost,"" he said.

IANS,"Taking a strong stance on the growing family feud within the INLD, party supremo Om Prakash Chautala expelled his elder son Ajay Singh Chautala from the primary membership of the party for ""anti-party activities"". The expulsion decision was announced by the Indian National Lok Dal state unit chief Ashok Arora here on Wednesday in the presence of senior party leaders and Ajay Chautala's younger brother, Abhay Singh Chautala. Arora read out a letter from Om Prakash Chautala, who is in Tihar Jail in the national capital, communicating his decision to all. A meeting of the INLD leadership has been called here on 17 November. Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala and his younger brother, Digvijay Chautala, who are the sons of Ajay Chautala, were expelled from the primary membership on 2 November by their grandfather, bringing the bitterness within the Chautala clan out in the open. Ajay Chautala, who was out of Tihar on parole, was touring various parts of Haryana to mobilise support for the party meeting and a rally he has called in Jind on 17 November. Reacting to the expulsion of Ajay Chautala, his son Digvijay Chautala said that the whole exercise was a ""conspiracy"" and the expulsion letter was ""forged"". Earlier, refusing to accept his expulsion, Dushyant had pointed out that neither has his expulsion order been issued officially by the INLD nor has the party's national executive met to decide the issue. Dushyant, who was also removed from the post of leader of the INLD Parliamentary Board, claimed that he had learnt about his 'expulsion' only through the media. The INLD, which is Haryana's main opposition party, could be heading for a split with the fight within the Chautala family spilling out into the open over the past few days. Dushyant and Digvijay Chautala are the great-grandsons of former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal. The action follows activities of both youth leaders and their supporters when they tried to project Dushyant as the chief ministerial face in Haryana next year. OP Chautala and his elder son, Ajay, were convicted in the JBT (junior basic teacher) recruitment scam in January 2013. Both were sentenced to 10 years' in prison by a Central Bureau of Investigation court in Delhi. Father and son have been barred from contesting elections due to the conviction.

Press Trust of India,": In a setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Rajasthan, the party's MP from Dausa Harish Chandra Meena joined the Congress on Wednesday. Meena joined the Congress in the presence of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sachin Pilot and AICC's state in-charge Avinash Pande. ""I am happy that Harish Meena has decided to join the Congress in such times. I welcome him in the Congress fold,"" Gehlot said at a press conference. Pilot and Gehlot said both of them will contest 7 December polls along with other senior leaders of the state. ""We are all united. It is BJP's conspiracy to spread false news that the Congress is divided,"" Gehlot said. In his remarks, Pilot attacked Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, saying she had betrayed the trust of the people of the state. Pilot said the tension was evident in the BJP camp with many senior leaders sidelined and not given tickets, showing that ""all is not well"". Asked why the Congress had not declared a chief ministerial face before the elections, Gehlot said this had never been done in Rajasthan. Pilot said Meena belongs to a family of Congress members and had joined the party without any conditions. In 2014, Harish Meena defeated his elder brother and senior Congress leader Namonarain Meena from the Dausa Lok Sabha seat. Namonarain Meena came third in the electoral contest. Harish Meena defeated his nearest rival Kirori Lal Meena, who was then a candidate of National People's Party and is now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP, by a margin of 45,404 votes. Kirori Lal Meena said Harish Meena's joining the Congress will have no impact on tribal votes in Dausa and its nearby regions. “There will be no impact.

Press Trust of India,": The ruling AIADMK unveiled a new statue of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa at its headquarters here Wednesday, months after the earlier one was criticised for not resembling the former party supremo. According to a party release, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and Joint Coordinator K Palaniswami paid floral tributes to the 'refurbished' statue of Jayalalithaa, in the presence of senior leaders, including MPs and state ministers. Palaniswami is the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and Panneerselvam is his deputy. The two leaders also felicitated sculptor Rajkumar Udayar who designed the statue, it said. A life-size statue of the leader was unveiled by the two leaders on 24 February, coinciding with Jayalalithaa's 70th birth anniversary. However, it drew criticism from various quarters that it bore little resemblance to Jayalalithaa following which the party decided to go in for a new one. Accordingly, the new statue was unveiled on Wednesday, and is placed near that of party founder and former chief minister MG Ramachandran at the entrance of the AIADMK headquarters. The new life size statue is made of bronze and weighs around 800 kg, a little more than the earlier one, party sources said.",2018-11-14,"AIADMK,Jayalalithaa,Jayalalithaa Statue,K Palaniswami,NewsTracker,Tamil Nadu",AIADMK unveils new statue of Jayalalithaa at Chennai party office after replacing earlier one which drew criticism,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/aiadmk-unveils-new-statue-of-jayalalithaa-at-chennai-party-office-after-replacing-earlier-one-which-drew-criticism-5549631.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sriram Karri," Arun Subhashchandra Yadav is in the middle of his life's biggest political mission but the sangfroid in his demeanour seldom betrays any anxiety, or nervousness. He smiles wholeheartedly, switching between responding to various phone calls, interruptions by various leaders and party workers seeking instructions, clarifications, and answers. He adds a line or two, beyond the answer sought, sometimes a quip, at times a joke, or a colloquial observation, and occasionally an aphorism so rustic that it lightens the mood of the tense room where almost everybody is doing more than one thing, and everything is a few hours behind schedule. At the politically infantile age of 44, Yadav has seen a lot already in politics. He is a two-term Lok Sabha Member of Parliament, has been in the Union Cabinet of the UPA-2 led by Manmohan Singh as Minister of State, holding a wide range of portfolios including Sports and Youth Affairs, Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, and Agriculture. Following the crushing defeat of the party in the Lok Sabha in 2014, the Congress, where he served as a secretary to the AICC, made him president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, making him one of the youngest Pradesh Congress Committee heads in India, before he recently handed over the reins to Kamal Nath. In over three years of leading the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, he has strengthened the party in the state and led several agitations against the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government in the state, and has now, after being made a member of the highest body in the party, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), been asked to directly take on Chouhan, the three-term chief minister, in his den of a constituency of Budhni (Budhani). In an interview, Yadav exuded confidence without sounding arrogant about his prospects, and more importantly, the prospects of the party in the state. Edited excerpts follow: Let me tell you that the adjective that best describes Chouhan, and his government, now in the state of Madhya Pradesh is ""extremely unpopular"". Yes, in Indian politics, standing against any incumbent is tough, more so against someone who has been at the helm of affairs in the state for three terms. But if you see the mood of the people in the state you will realise the anger has crossed all thresholds. People are angry, disappointed and furious. They are now taking lead ahead of our party leaders and workers in questioning and opposing the BJP. In that sense, maybe Budhni, which bears no semblance to the constituency of a big leader, much less a chief minister, marked with no development, no facilities, no infrastructure but abounding in illegal mining and corruption of the family members of Chouhan, might actually turn out to be the ""safest"" seat for a Congress candidate today. The biggest combination of all issues is the position of our state in the nation on all accounts. After three terms, what has the BJP done for the people? The highest number of farmer suicides take place in Madhya Pradesh, and one of the districts badly affected is Sehore, the home of Chouhan. There are no jobs. Youths are unemployed and frustrated. Women don’t feel safe. Look at the state of our infrastructure. There are no new investments. The state is at a worse level than in 2003 when the BJP came to power. But on the other hand, corruption is rampant. BJP leaders make money on everything. The sand mafia rules the state. Family members of not just the chief minister, but all leaders are involved in illegal mining, illegal construction and takeover of government contracts. Nothing gets done for the people, BJP leaders become richer. We have always delivered what we have stood for, and what we have promised. The Congress will first address the farmers' issue by ensuring lower priced and better quality inputs like seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, urea on the one hand and better than MSP prices for their output. We will waive loans of farmers of up to Rs two lakh in one go. We will also give them income support of Rs 3,000 per farmer family. We will deracinate corruption in every ministry and department ruthlessly and with zero tolerance. We will be providing a support internship of Rs 4,000 to unemployed youths till they get jobs. Job creation and development are top areas of focus and we will revitalise the economy of the state with a new investment and industrial policy. Our 'Vachan Patra' (manifesto) has also promised that we will scrap the Vyapam Board, (MP Professional Examination Board) through which Chouhan has destroyed or robbed the careers of lakhs of youth. The Congress is a secular Indian party. We are true Hindus, who don’t use religion for political gains. We don’t make false promises. We respect all religions and will obviously work for not just the economic and practical aspirations but also the religious and spiritual aspirations of our people. No. Our party has a policy of not projecting chief ministerial faces. The entire party works together and ensures under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi that we remove the BJP from power here. Once the counting is done and we are ready to form the government, the high command will decide. Absolutely united. We are like the Pandavas, brothers together, taking on the Kauravas and we will change the future of our state. Historically, the BSP has had a small but consistent vote share and an alliance would have helped. Similarly, we could have also brought in the Samajwadi Party, because it also has a following, especially in the areas closer to Uttar Pradesh. An alliance therefore would have given us bigger margins and more seats. But while it did not happen, it won’t impact the overall outcome that the Congress is coming to power after 15 years in Madhya Pradesh. My own internal assessment is around 154 to 163 (out of 230) as of now, but it could go up.

People know who is an opportunist and an opportunist can go anywhere,” Kirori Lal Meena said.

Maheswara Reddy and T Ramesh Babu," The Maoist threat is quite categorical: postpone the Telangana Assembly elections to February or face violent disruption of the poll process if the Election Commission goes ahead with its decision to have a one-day state-wide voting on 7 December. A four-page communique from the Maoists sent to the Bhupalpally Tahsildar Office has demanded that the elections be held in February to enable around 30 lakh young people to become eligible to vote. The Maoists have even laid out a detailed schedule for the Election Comission to follow: notification on 12 January, candidate nominations to close on 22 January, voting on 14 February and counting on 19 February. The Maoist communique argues that this will enable lakhs of Intermediate, Degree, PG, B Tech, M Tech, B Ed, and TTC students to enroll themselves in the voters' list between 1 and 14 January, 2019, especially as the present electoral rolls do not include many unemployed youth. Maoists assure no violence if the elections are held as per their proposed schedules and plenty of it if their demand is ignored. Surprisingly, Congress leader Marri Shashidhar Reddy, who filed a petition in Telangana High Court questioning the truncated revision of electoral rolls, agrees with the Maoist demand for poll postponement. “I am not sure about 30 lakh new voters,” he said, adding, “But certainly, lakhs of youth will become voters if elections are held in February or March. Denying voting right to youths will distance them from democratic process.” The four-page poster/communique apart, Jayashankar Bhupalpally village and some others — particularly on the border with Chhattisgarh — are witnessing a rash of posters and banners urging villagers to boycott the December polls. Though this is not the first time Maoists have put up such posters before an election, fear is beginning to grip the villagers after a “landmine” was found near a culvert under one such banner. The police, while clarifying that the ‘landmine’ was a dummy without explosives or detonators, are nevertheless on high alert, conducting combing operations in the region. There are 80 high sensitive polling booths in two Assembly constituencies — Mulugu and Bhupalpally in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district. ""We are taking all measures to create awareness among the voters. There was a similar situation during the last elections but the polling was 78.46 percent. I do not think these posters will have any impact on the voters,’’ says Jayashankar Bhupalpally district collector V Venkateswarlu. Local politicians and candidates of all parties in areas like Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Peddapalli, Bhadrachalam, Kothagudem, Chennur, Manthani and Machiryala, which have a history of Maoist presence and activity, are a worried lot unlike in the past when such posters were largely ignored by all and had little impact on the electoral process. Especially after the recent killing of a Telugu Desam Party MLA K Sarveshwara Rao and former MLA S Soma in Tottangi village in Araku Assembly constituency in Visakhapatnam district of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Though some, like Putta Madhukar, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) candidate from Manthani, put up a brave face, saying, “The call to boycott elections has no relevance in democracy."" This view was echoed by Professor G Haragopal, activist and educationist, who said, “There are no instances of boycotting elections, even in tribal areas where Maoists have some influence. Voters in these areas might not come to the polling stations fearing violence but they never boycotted the elections.” In fact, Professor Haragopal says that the Maoists boycott call makes it easy for political parties. “These parties have created an impression that those who do not vote are considered to be dead,” he said. Also, as a boycott will not stop the election process, “the common man considers participating in elections as a responsibility."" Political analyst and writer Telakapalli Ravi, criticising the Maoist boycott call, said that “many leaders with Maoist background are playing a key role in the Telangana government”. He added that Maoists in Telangana are losing their cadre. “For example, Gaddar is expected to contest.” No one compares the situation in Telangana to that in Bastar. But observers do point out that candidates are being prevented from entering villagers, not due to any Maoist boycott call, but because of their own failure to fulfill their promises to voters. Money does influence voting, with all parties distributing money before polling day. The general view is that voters take money from all and end up pushing the NOTA option. “It is true that Maoists have some influence in rural areas, especially in tribal villages. They have put up banners and posters asking the authorities to postpone the elections and appealing to voters to boycott the elections. However, there will not be much impact of these posters and banners on the voters,’’ says Bonala Surendrachari from Bhupalpally village. While the Maoists, despite putting up boycott posters, have rarely reacted violently against voters in the past, authorities are not taking any chances. Police has increased security for candidates and asked political leaders not to venture into these areas without prior intimation. “We have noticed banners and posters near Venkatapuram mandal,” said Kumar Bhandari, sub-inspector, Venkatapuram. “Combing operations are on for the last three months. We have not taken any extra security measures because of the recent posters and banners put up by Maoists. There were no Maoist activities in these areas till recently.”",2018-11-14,"Assembly Election 2018,ConnectTheDots,Election Commission,India,Jayashankar Bhupalpally,Maoists,Naxals,NewsTracker,Politics,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,Telangana Polls","Telangana elections 2018: After Chhattisgarh, Maoists call for voters to shun polls; local parties say boycott irrelevant in democracy",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/telangana-elections-2018-after-chhattisgarh-maoists-call-for-voters-to-shun-polls-local-parties-say-boycott-irrelevant-in-democracy-5544511.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sandip Ghose,"  Outside the Coimbatore airport, a giant billboard of Adi Yogi greets visitors. The targets of this 'in your face' spiritual marketing is obviously not the regular temple-goer. They are affluent religious tourists arriving from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, heading to the fashionable spiritual retreat at some distance from the city. In holiday season, they often outnumber the vacationers going to the Nilgiris. There is something neat and civilised about the ambience of the airport. In a way, it typifies the city and its people. Once known as the ""Manchester of the East"" for its textile industry, Coimbatore has a character of its own. The Coimbatore Club is still referred to as the ""English Club"" by the locals. As the second largest city of the state, Coimbatore is distinct from other big towns of Tamil Nadu. Partly because of the gateway to parts of adjoining Kerala. Palakkad is 55 kilometres away. After Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, Coimbatore is a major medical tourism destination in the South. It is also developing as an education hub. Along with the nearby areas of Tiruppur, Erode and Salem, Coimbatore remains a major industrial hub of the South. This bring a steady stream of business travellers to Coimbatore, or Kovai as some prefer to call it. It now hosts many of the national and international brands of hotels. On my frequent trips through the city over the past few years, I have been intrigued to see a noticeable presence of BJP billboards on the arterial avenues. Then one has read about the presence of RSS in the area and occasional  This also explains the RSS holding a three-day conference in Coimbatore last year and Narendra Modi attending the   with huge fanfare. Chilling over beer at the club to beat the summer heat, I have sought enlightenment on the local political milieu from fellow thirst-quenchers. From their perch at the bar counter, they educated me on the most fascinating history of this region known as Kongu Nadu. A brief flashback to the past may be instructive in understanding present polity of this north-western corner of Tamil Nadu. Archaeologists have found evidence of an industrial colony from 2,500 years ago. It fell on an ancient Roman trade route with a Chola highway running through it. After being tossed between the Cholas, Cheras, Hoysalas it became a part of the Vijayanagar Empire and finally, the Kingdom of Mysore. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British annexed it to the Madras Residency. For me this cultural cross-fertilisation is best reflected in types of biryani available in the city. In Coimbatore, one can find authentic outlets serving Ambur, Dindigul, Hyderabadi and Kerala biryanis. Stretching the point a bit, it might also explain Kongu Nadu's aspiration to be carved out as a separate state. This assertion of a separate identity was channelised into a Brahminical push-back, contributed to partly by the Muslim dominance in neighbouring parts of Kerala and erstwhile Mysore. That gave RSS an entry into the area as far back as in the 1960s, I was told. However, the RSS ceded space to the AIADMK over the years and only now is it showing some signs of resurgence. But, very early days yet. Will AIADMK's hold in the area weaken after the demise of J Jayalalithaa? In the new fluid landscape of Tamil politics no one is sure. But, they rule out DMK gaining strength in Kongu Nadu post-Kalaignar. The road to Ooty via Kotagiri is one of the finest hill highways of the country. That was thanks to it passing by Kodanad Estate, which served as the unofficial summer capital of Tamil Nadu during Amma’s regime. One would then see cars with red beacons and SUVs of politicians lined up near the Kotagiri bus station. Now the crowd and the buzz have evaporated. Kodanad Estate has reportedly fallen into disrepair. Some tourists still take the short detour to the Kodanadu view point for the sake of nostalgia. Who knows if it will be converted to a tourist destination someday in the memory of Jayalalithaa. But, for now, although the centre of gravity has shifted back to Chennai, Amma’s influence still pervades in the Nilgiri air. The Dussehra and Diwali breaks brings large contingents of the Chennai business gentry to Coonoor and Ooty. Conversations over cards, coffee and cognac inevitably veer towards politics. The common refrain is ""Who’s running the state?"". But, they provide the answer too. Tamil Nadu has one of the most efficient bureaucracies. It is still one of the most coveted IAS cadres. The state delivery system especially on healthcare, education and public infrastructure is arguably the finest in the country. MGR is given much of the credit for creating this strong administrative foundation. But, others who followed him also deserve acknowledgement for not tampering with it. So despite high level of political corruption, the government can pretty much run on auto-pilot. The Chennai peerage accepts the swing in sentiment towards the DMK with the chaos that followed Jayalalithaa's demise with warring factions in the AIADMK. But, they are not sure about how far MK Stalin will be able to capitalise on it. Their reservations stem from two thoughts. First, it is not clear after the death of M Karunanidhi how much money power Stalin commands. No one can yet write off Sasikala totally. Some suspect she may be holding the purse strings even from prison. Votes in Tamil Nadu are not ""got"" but ""bought"", they say. In that, AIADMK may still have an edge. The second area of concern is the  . He is systematically dismantling the decentralised structure of the party with by replacing the powerful district bosses with his own handpicked loyalists. Whether this would lead to any ground level dissonance cannot be predicted. However, by openly declaring his support for Chandrababu Naidu in Telangana, Stalin has effectively jumped onto the Mahagathbandhan bandwagon. Whether the gamble pays off will depend on how the Congress-TDP alliance fares in the Assembly polls. If it does well, it might revive the prospects of a Coromandel Coalition to keep the BJP out from the South of Vindhyas. As far as Modi and Rahul Gandhi go, the common voters in Tamil Nadu are likely to be agnostic — irrespective of what mood of the nation surveys may show. What will influence their choice is how the national alignment take shape. Kamal Haasan has already thrown his lot with the ""secular"" forces. There are speculations of BJP trying to play the Hindu card in Tamil Nadu as well. The RSS and Yogi Adityanath may be marshalled for campaigning. Or will Rajinikanth be the wild card entry for the NDA? At this point, only the Adi Guru may have the answer.",2018-11-13,"Adi Yogi,AIADMK,Congress,ConnectTheDots,DMK,J. Jayalalithaa,M.

FP Staff,"With the Supreme Court poised to take up the petitions against women's entry in Sabarimala shrine, the Ayyappa devotees are in a prayer mode across Kerala. The Nair Service Society — a socio-cultural organisation of Hindu upper caste Nair community — which is at the forefront of the protests seeking protection of the temple custom and rituals, has asked its 5600 units to conduct day-long prayer sessions (Naamajapom) throughout the state. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has convened a high-level meeting of officials to review the preparedness of the official machinery to ensure the smooth conduct of the upcoming pilgrim season. The chief minister is also planning to visit Pampa and Nilakkal, the major hubs of protests by devotees against the implementation of the supreme court verdict. Meanwhile, the political drama surrounding the hill shrine continued. The   led by BJP state presdient PS Sreedharan Pillai from the state's northern district of Kasargod is set to conclude at Pathanamthitta on Tuesday. The rally, which was flagged off on 8 November, has carried on till now without any communal tensions. Though Pillai spent lot of time defending the attacks on the party for its communal agenda, BJP leaders claimed that the   helped the party gain the support of Ayyappa devotees.

The party's movement launched against the politicisation of Sabarimala issue has taken state leaders across the length and breadth of Kerala. The rallies from Kasargod, Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram, Thodupuzha and Palakkad will culminate at Pathanamathitta on 15 November. This comes at a time when the   to take up as many as 48 petitions challenging its earlier order allowing women entry in the shrine.  A bunch of such petitions would be taken up for consideration in-chamber by a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices RF Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra. Besides these pleas, three separate petitions seeking review of the verdict are also slated to come up for hearing in the open court before a bench comprising CJI Gogoi and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph. Meanwhile, the Kerala government is mulling convening an all-party meeting to ensure smooth conduct of the two-month seasons in case the Supreme Court refuses to accept the review and writ petitions.  ""We are thinking of calling for an all-party meeting. We have not taken a final decision yet. There are plans...,"" Travancore Devaswom Board Minister Kadakkampally Surendran told reporters on Monday. However, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has denied any such decision claiming that the Kerala government will wait out the period preceding the Supreme Court's ruling on the review petitions, and subsequently, will ensure that the decision of the Supreme Court is implemented. The hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala opens on 17 November for the two-month long Mandala-Makkaravillakku pilgrim season in the backdrop of continuing protests against the Supreme Court order allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at the temple. Reports said that as many as 550 women belonging to the traditionally barred age group have registered for 'darshan' at the Lord Ayyappa shrine in the upcoming season. Thus in view of these developments, state police chief Loknath Behra has called a high-level meeting of officers Tuesday to discuss the security plans at Sabarimala. The police has also made elaborate   to help facilitate darshan in the midst of protests at the flood-ravaged hill shrine. The new measures include an online booking system to control pilgrims and a pass system for vehicles. However, despite these arrangements senior officials, in the know of things, acknowledged the fact that the police force may not be able to facilitate women's entry to the shrine in face of protests and threats of violence. Though Kerala Police have made a tentative plan to deploy 16,000 men in batches during the two month-long season, senior officers said they may fail to enable the entry of young women, recounting how the police force crumbled when the temple was opened for the monthly pooja in October and special pooja on 5 November. The state police force's strength is simply not enough to manage the security, as at least a lakh devotees are expected to visit the shrine every day during the season. In addition to the protesters, the police will also have to take into consideration that terrorists and extremists might likely infiltrate the Hill under the guise of devotees and create trouble. Intelligence agencies at the Centre, and in various states, have already warned of this possibility. The Sabarimala special commissioner has warned that if the police use force it could lead to stampede resulting in death and injury to devotees at the shrine, the trek to which is literally a bottleneck.",2018-11-13,"BJP,CJI Ranjan Gogoi,Congress,Kadakkampally Surendran,Mandala-Makkaravillakku Pilgrim Season,NewsTracker,Ranjan Gogoi,Sabarimala,Sabarimala Reopening,Sabarimala Review Petition,Sabarimala Review Petition In SC,Supreme Court,Supreme Court Hearing On Sabarimala,Supreme Court Of India",Yatra politics peaks in Kerala as SC gears up to hear review pleas against Sabarimala verdict; Pinarayi Vijayan chairs high-level meet,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/yatra-politics-peaks-in-kerala-as-supreme-court-gears-up-to-hear-review-pleas-against-sabarimala-verdict-pinarayi-vijayan-chairs-high-level-meet-5540521.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sandipan Sharma,"The BJP's first list of candidates for Rajasthan has the imprimatur of chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who has managed to have her say in the selection process in spite of the high command’s efforts to curtail her powers. In spite of a pre-poll exercise aimed at replacing many of the incumbents, the BJP high command has fielded 85 sitting legislators in the first list of 131, indicating it has relented to Raje's pressure for retaining her loyalists and making other state leaders like Arjun Ram Meghwal and Gajendra Singh irrelevant. Raje's stamp on the list shows two things: One, the BJP central leadership has allowed the CM to fight the battle the way she wants, and two, it is wary of rebellion more than anti-incumbency. Till the day candidates were announced, it was widely believed that more than 60 percent of the BJP legislators in the 200-member house would be jettisoned. The BJP’s own surveys had reportedly predicted 115 incumbents were locked in tough contests they may lose. One of the important factors behind the BJP”s reluctance to counter anti-incumbency with large-scale changes is the fear that rebels would have become a headache in a milieu of rising discontent. Raje seemed to have conveyed to the high command that new faces would find it difficult to battle the twin effects of anti-incumbency and powerful BJP rebels in a large number of constituencies. Party insiders said, the original idea was to replace 100-plus MLAs. But even if half of them had entered the fray as Independent candidates or joined the third front led by Hanuman Beniwal, the BJP campaign would have started on a bad note. Also, its energy would have been sapped by efforts to manage rebels. There is, however, the clear danger of triple anti-incumbency — against the Centre, the state and the local candidate — working against the party. If the Congress chooses its candidates wisely, the BJP would find the going tough. Be that as it may, Raje's supremacy in Rajasthan has been accepted by the party. This may, of course, cut both ways. If she manages to win Rajasthan, the chief minister's stature would grow further, making her the automatic choice for the top job. It would also re-establish her as a party heavyweight, a privilege she seemed to have lost in the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah era. But, if the BJP loses, Raje would be the only one to be blamed and held responsible, especially after getting candidates of her choice. A major loss would result in clamour for phasing her out and handing over the reins to some other leader before the Lok Sabha elections. The contours of an ongoing struggle for leadership are visible in the first list where in spite of Raje's clout, the RSS has managed to field some of its favorites-- like Madan Dilawar-- who are the CM’s critics. The BJP’s critics may like to see the first list with an entirely different perspective. The high command’s inability to replace incumbents may come across as an act of surrender—not to Raje but to the growing fear that Rajasthan is a lost cause and the realization that it is more prudent to let the CM lead the battle and keep the prime minister away from it.",2018-11-13,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Congress,Hanuman Beniwal,Narendra Modi,PoliticalPlay,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Assembly Polls,Rajasthan Polls 2018,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan elections 2018: Vasundhara Raje retains loyalists in BJP's first list of candidates, goes against party's pre-poll assessment",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-elections-2018-vasundhara-raje-retains-loyalists-in-bjps-first-list-of-candidates-goes-against-partys-pre-poll-assessment-5540071.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": It's not only the geographical and social features that sets the Bundelkhand region apart from the rest of Madhya Pradesh, leaders believe the electoral politics is also much different here with the fight not being limited to the arch-rivals BJP and Congress. Just like its treacherous hill roads, the region is expected to see an interesting poll battle. Some leaders claim that non-BJP parties have even resorted to 'friendly fights' on some seats to stop the saffron party from taking advantage of non-consolidation of votes for a joint opposition candidate due to complex caste equations in the area dominated by Dalits and other backward castes. Given the geographical and cultural proximity of over two dozen Assembly seats in this area to the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, two key political parties with a strong presence in the state across the border — Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party — are leaving no stones unturned in challenging the ruling BJP. The four bordering districts of Bundelkhand region — Sagar, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Panna — and two districts of Chambal Zone — Datia and Shivpuri — together send 30 MLAs to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. Out of this, the BJP has got 22 and the Congress has 8 seats in the outgoing Assembly. As the election campaign heats up for the 28 November elections across 230 Assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, where BJP has been in power for 15 years thwarting every challenge so far from the Congress, the observers feel it may not be a traditional direct fight between these two parties in the areas along the UP border. The reasons cited by poll pundits range from caste equations to cultural and social influence of the neighbouring areas from Uttar Pradesh, as also a strong campaign being mounted by the SP and the BSP and what many political leaders call an 'undeclared understanding' these two parties have reached with the Congress to take on the saffron party unitedly without forging a ""visible alliance"". The opposition leaders insist that the anti-incumbency factor against the 15-year BJP rule is much more prominent in the Bundelkhand region, as compared to the rest of Madhya Pradesh, being far off from the state capital Bhopal. Also, the region has larger dominance of the SC/ST and other backward classes. Datia MLA Narottam Mishra, a prominent minister in the Shivraj Singh government, however rejected the anti-incumbency factor, citing the development work done by the BJP Government. Mishra said the election is going to be rather easy this time, compared to the last three Assembly polls, as ""historical development work"" has been done by the state government in the Bundelkhand region. He also dismissed any challenge from the 'joint' opposition challenge and said none of these parties would be visible after elections. Mishra said these parties tried a similar strategy in last elections but voters rejected their ""gimmicks"" and voted for development schemes of the BJP government that helps all sections of the society. He further said people in the neighboring Uttar Pradesh are also praising the developmental work done in Bundelkhand and it is the rejected leaders of the SP and the BSP from Uttar Pradesh who are looking for a political future in Madhya Pradesh through this region. The SP is focussing on all six districts of Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh (which include Damoh and Datia also) and the BSP has fielded candidates in the Chambal and Vindhya regions also, along with the Bundelkhand region. The BSP has four MLAs in the outgoing Assembly — two from Satna district in Vindhya area and two from Morena district of Chambal area. The BSP has given ticket to all four sitting MLAs and two former MLAs too. The SP has has fielded a former MLA from Niwari constituency in the Tikamgarh district. The BSP's Bundelkhand in-charge Mukesh Ahirwar said the party is contesting all 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh. He said the party is in a strong position in Bundelkhand therefore a key focus area. The BSP president Mayawati will start poll campaign on 21 November from Morena and will address public rallies over two days in Bundelkhand, Chambal and Vindhya region, Ahirwar said. A senior SP leader said the party's main focus is to defeat the BJP, for which it has an understanding with the Congress and BSP for some seats, asserting a formal alliance was not preferable due to complex caste equations of the area. He said a joint candidate against the BJP on all seats would have actually benefited the saffron party and therefore they have opted for a ""friendly fight"". Balakram Yadav, a senior leader of Congress party's Bundelkhand unit, said he is confident of a ""strategic success"" in these elections. He said the over-confidence of the ruling BJP would prove to be detrimental for the saffron party and the people's anger will reflect in their votes. Rejecting the BJP's claims of development works in the region, Yadav said they were limited to a few cities and the farmers are facing a major crisis in the agriculture-dominated rural areas of Bundelkhand region due to drought and fuel price hike while youths are being compelled to migrate because of unemployment.",2018-11-13,"Bahujan Samaj Party,BJP,Bundelkhand,Chhatarpur,Congress,Datia,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,NewsTracker,Panna,Sagar,Samajwadi Party,Shivpuri,Tikamgarh","No straight fight for Congress and BJP in Bundelkhand; SP, BSP add new twists and turns to Madhya Pradesh polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/no-straight-fight-for-congress-and-bjp-in-bundelkhand-sp-bsp-add-new-twists-and-turns-to-madhya-pradesh-polls-5540271.html,firstpost,-1,0
Parth MN,"The manifesto of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) promises to increase the Minimum Support Price of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal. So does the manifesto of the Congress. The JCC has promised to end ""outsourcing"" of work in government jobs, in turn enabling local employment. So has the Congress. Former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi, who once used to be the face of the Congress in the state, broke away to form the JCC in 2016. He has forged a pre-poll alliance with the BSP and CPI, hoping to be the kingmaker on 11 December. The difference between the promises of Congress and JCC, said Jogi, is that he has sworn to deliver on a 100-rupee stamp paper. ""If I go back on my assurances, anyone can file a complaint, and I could be jailed for two years,"" he told   in his constituency of Marwahi in Bilaspur district. ""Has the Congress done it [provided such assurances]?"" Jogi, however, went on to say his main target in the elections is the BJP. ""Narendra Modi has done nothing for the farmers,"" he said, ""For the first time, Chhattisgarh farmers are committing suicide. They never took this step earlier, not even under British rule. It means the farmers do not have faith in the government."" Sitting in a wheelchair, two people ready to escort him into his private ambulance in which he travels, Jogi ended the conversation by saying a post-poll alliance would not be needed with any party. ""We will form the government on our own,"" he said. He knows it is not true. So do his party workers. ""The state government will not be formed without Ajit Jogi,"" one of his confidants later said anonymously, ""We would prefer a post-poll alliance with the Congress if Jogi gets the chief ministership."" Jogi's entry in the race has thrown the elections wide open. It has dismantled the conventional equations. Observers believe had it not been a three-way contest, the Congress would have been sitting comfortably. Jogi has a pan-Chhattisgarh appeal with a following among Dalits, Christians and Muslims. He claims to be a tribal leader as well — even though it is contested — but has made the Marwahi constituency reserved for the Schedule Tribe his den. He swept the seat in 2003 and 2008 on a Congress ticket, without ever visiting it once. In 2013, his son Amit won by a margin of over 40,000 votes. For 2018, Jogi is back contesting from Marwahi. Adjacent to Marwahi is the constituency of Kota, from where Renu Jogi has won thrice — including a by-election — on a Congress ticket. Renu, Jogi's wife, is now contesting for her husband's party. In the 2013 elections, even though the BJP won 49 seats and Congress was down to 39, the gap in vote share was less than one percent. In an election that appears to be closely fought where every seat matters, here are two seats the Congress used to take for granted, and will now find hard to retain. Ramchand Kashyap, a farmer from Kudhkai village in Marwahi, said Jogi is accessible and has his heart in the right place. ""My son was thrown off the train a month ago for travelling with the wrong ticket,"" he said, confirming his vote would go to 'Jogi Congress', as the JCC is commonly referred on the ground. ""He leg was severely injured. I had to sell my land to treat him. I am a BJP worker, but my party did not help me. I went to Jogi  , and he immediately listened to me and promised to help. He knows the people of his constituency and cares for them."" Both the husband and wife are riding a wave of sympathy in their own way. Jogi, 72, who became paraplegic after a terrible accident in 2004, moves around in a wheelchair, yet is following a hectic schedule conducting two to three rallies a day between doctor's appointments. ""If it had been someone else instead of him, he would have been bedridden,"" said Kashyap, as he watched Jogi being lifted from his wheelchair by four men and put in his helicopter before embarking on another rally. Renu, on the other hand, is perceived to have been victimised by the Congress. She did not quit the party immediately after Jogi broke away and formed the JCC. In fact, she stayed on in the Congress for well over a year after the inception of the JCC. But when the Congress state leadership marginalised her, and eventually denied her a ticket from Kota, she quit the party and joined the JCC. ""My family has been associated with the Congress for years,"" she said, ""The people of Kota, whom I consider my family, elected me when I contested for the Congress. I did not want to betray them. But when the party rejected me, I consulted the people of Kota and joined the JCC."" Shantibai Singh and her husband Jeetandra, both farmers in Renu's constituency, believe the Congress shortchanged her. ""She remained loyal to the party even after her husband left,"" they said, adding that the BJP government has been a disaster for farmers. ""We have been asking for permanent electricity connection for so long. It would give us free electricity for five horse power irrigation pumps. Because we have not got one, we have taken a temporary connection that costs Rs 2,500 for three months,"" they added. Across Chhattisgarh, Chief Minister Raman Singh faces anti-incumbency, mainly due to farm crisis and unemployment, which is why Jogi's promises of stipends to unemployed graduates and a fixed deposit of Rs one lakh in the name of every girl child that is born in his tenure, have struck a chord. Jogi enjoys a certain popularity among the Dalits, and his tie-up with Mayawati has consolidated the Dalit votes, which had cost Congress in 2013 as well. Even though the BSP has shrunk in Chhattisgarh, the party's vote share in 11 constituencies in 2013 was more than the margin by which the Congress had fallen short of the BJP tally. And only four of those 11 seats were reserved for members of Schedule Castes. The alliance is an opportunity for BSP to revive its dwindling presence in the state, and for Jogi to establish himself as a strong regional satrap. In the bastions of the Jogi family, Renu, though, might not find the going as smooth as her husband. Contesting against her on a Congress ticket is Vibhor Singh, a former DSP officer, who was once injured in Bastar fighting Naxals. His mother belongs to the Gond tribe, which constitutes a significant population of Kota. Some even feel the split vote could help the BJP sneak through. But Renu is confident ""her family"" will not let her down when she needs it the most. ""I have represented this constituency for a while,"" she said.

Asian News International,": As the campaigning for assembly elections is on its peak in Madhya Pradesh, the residents of seven unauthorised colonies in Neemuch's Baghana have put up posters outside their houses stating they will boycott the forthcoming polls.

Press Trust of India,": At least 76 percent of the licensed gun owners have deposited their arms to the police in Mizoram ahead of the 28 November Assembly elections, a senior police officer said on Tuesday. Inspector General of Police (IGP) LH Shanliana said that 10,337 licensed gun owners had deposited their firearms in various police stations across Mizoram. The deputy commissioners of all the districts in the state had issued orders asking all registered gun owners to deposit their firearms before the Assembly elections as per a directive issued by the Election Commission of India. Shanliana hoped that all licensed gun owners, including farmers, would deposit their firearms before the polls though the farmers need guns to protect their jhums (cultivation) from animals at this time of the year. ""We have received excellent cooperation from the village councils in the rural areas and the local councils in the capital Aizawl city,"" he said. Keeping in mind the gun owners' sentiments about their guns, he said they would be able to check and clean their firearms whenever they want to do so by visiting the respective police stations and outposts.

Press Trust of India,": In poll-bound Telangana, the ruling TRS and the Congress-led opposition alliance claim that it is going to be a straight fight between them and that the BJP is not in the reckoning. The saffron party, on the other hand, claims that the southern state is staring at a hung verdict, indicating that it will emerge as a kingmaker.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader and a key minister in the caretaker government, KT Rama Rao, son of party supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao, echoed a similar view. ""The Congress is our main rival. The BJP does not exist in Telangana,"" he said. Rama Rao claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates would forfeit their deposits in more than 100 seats (of the 119 in the state) and ""not even one MLA in the just-dissolved House will return"". TRS floor leader in the Lok Sabha AP Jithender Reddy said it would be ""great"" for the BJP if it succeeded in retaining its five seats and claimed that the Amit Shah-led party was even finding it difficult to get candidates for the 7 December polls. Khuntia said the people of Telangana were looking at a contest between the Congress-led alliance and the TRS. ""There is no in-between. Neither the BJP nor the smaller parties can create confidence among the people that they can form the government. The fight is between the Congress-led alliance and the TRS,"" he added.

Press Trust of India," Congress president Rahul Gandhi Tuesday launched a diatribe against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""misleading"" people on India's development. Addressing a rally ahead of the second phase of polling in the state on 20 November, Rahul said as per Modi, development of the country began only after 2014, when he became the prime minister. ""He (Modi) doesn't even know that the country is run by the people and not by a single man. He insults you by making such comments,"" the Congress president said. Demonetisation and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was aimed to break the back of small and medium businesses, Rahul said. Congress will encourage youth to do business and get loan facility from banks, he added. The Congress is not against big industrialists, but if government gives them benefit, small and medium businesses should not be neglected, he said. ""Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Vijay Mallya fled the country with thousands of crores of rupees belonging to the people of India. Modi does nothing to bring them back to the country and doesn't utter a word on the issue,"" he said. He claimed the CBI director was removed from his post at 1 am to stop a probe into the Rafale deal. ""If there is an investigation, only two names will come up: Narendra Modi and Anil Ambani. Modi is scared of a probe,"" he said. Rahul claimed Anil Ambani was chosen over HAL for the Rafale deal despite HAL having 70 years experience in manufacturing fighter aircraft. ""Anil Ambani didn't have the experience. He may not have made even a paper aeroplane,"" he said. 
Rahul said there is an undercurrent in favour of the Congress in the 18 constituencies of Chhattisgarh which went to polls on Monday. Results from Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and other poll-bound states will go in favour of the Congress, he said. Chhattisgarh is rich in resources, the Congress president said, adding the ""dream of the state was broken due to the misrule"" of the BJP government. Promising a ""people's government"" in Chhattisgarh if voted to power, he said people want a government which listens to their ""Mann ki Baat"". ""Instead of working for a few industrialists, Congress will work for development of agriculture, education and health in the state,"" Rahul said.",2018-11-13,"Anil Ambani,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Narendra Modi,Rafale Deal,TheySaidIt","Chhattisgarh polls: Narendra Modi doesn't know country isn't run by one man, says Rahul Gandhi",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-polls-narendra-modi-doesnt-know-country-isnt-run-by-one-man-says-rahul-gandhi-5543231.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Politics,"There is an unambiguous political ideology distinction emerging in Tamil Nadu. On one side, you have ""Superstar"" Rajinikanth, an actor who has openly shown fealty to the Bharatiya Janata Party — especially with his latest comment about how the  . Then there is Kamal Haasan, another superstar, who launched his political outfit, Makkal Needhi Maiam, in February this year and has thrown his weight behind ""secular forces"". The two Tamil actors, who are fundamentally different even in the kinds of films they pick and characters they portray onscreen, have maintained their radically different views in the political arena, as well. Rajinikanth and Kamal have made noticeable strides in Tamil politics, and   have claimed, the duo have taken the sheen off many established political parties in the state. Rajinikanth, who has not yet officially announced allegiance to any party, was caught in a controversy after his comments on demonetisation and the BJP. ""The demonetisation scheme was not implemented properly. We need to have a larger discussion on it."" He had also said, ""If all Opposition parties are coming together against the saffron party, it must be a dangerous party."" However, as the media picked up his comments, he soon clarified his remarks. ""I was asked whether the BJP was a dangerous party. I answered that the united front thinks it is a dangerous party. Whether it is a dangerous party or not, voters will decide,"" Rajinikanth said. While everything thing said and done in politics these days seems to be inching towards the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it will be interesting to watch the two paths that the two film stalwarts take. Here are a few factors that will define their political allegiances in future. That the two actors will never politically join hands was stowed away as an idea when Kamal said there was a hue of saffron in Rajinikanth’s politics, and until that changed, he wouldn't enter into an alliance with the south superstar. ""There is a hue of saffron in Rajini’s politics. If that doesn't change, then I don't see an alliance with him. We are good friends, but politics is different,"" he was  . Way before he forayed into national politics, Kamal never shied away from speaking his mind, even if his comments were political in nature. In 2013, upset over the hurdles caused by the ban on the release of his film  , Kamal had said Tamil Nadu does not want him to stay in the state. ""If MF Hussain can do it, Kamal Haasan will do it... I am fed up. I am an artiste. After that, I will have to seek a secular State for my stay... Secular state from Kashmir to Kerala, excluding Tamil Nadu... Tamil Nadu wants me out."" The drama is unmistakable, and one wonders why didn't Kamal join politics faster. By 2017, there were a slew of legal cases piling up against Kamal. A petition was filed in the Madras High Court, asking the court to direct the Commissioner of Police in Chennai to file a case against the actor and investigate his views on ""Hindu terrorism"". In November last year, answering Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who had asked the actor to reflect on efforts by right-wing groups to dilute Tamil/Dravidian culture in a column in Tamil magazine  , the actor said, ""Hindus cannot challenge others to show extremists among them since extremism has spread to that extent even among the Hindus. Hindus are losing faith in the principle of 'Satyameva Jayate', and instead, they are subscribing to 'Might is Right.'"" Political analyst   ""His anti-BJP position is consistent. He wants to channelise the anger among the people against the BJP. We have to note that even the DMK has not used the term 'Hindu terror' ever. Kamal can say it without fear because unlike many, he is not scared of income tax raids."" Another case, regarding the same statement, was filed against the actor in Varanasi, and Kamal even said he would visit Uttar Pradesh and meet people in Varanasi if the court summoned him. ""There is nothing to be ashamed of here. I have started my journey towards people, and this is part of it."" A few months later, in February, Kamal launched his political party. In May 2017, a   against Kamal at the Thirunelveli district court by the Hindu Munnani Katchi for allegedly hurting the Hindu sentiments. In an interview to a regional channel, Kamal had said, ""The country reads about the book in which a woman (Draupadi) was used as a pawn and gambled away."" The direct dig at the   was not taken lightly. The superstar has been a lot more restrained with his words and political views, which is why there have been speculations for the longest time about whether Rajinikanth will ally with the BJP, or the AIADMK, or the DMK, or like Kamal, or float his own party. But right now, the superstar's political stand is pretty clear. In December 2017, Rajini confirmed his entry into Tamil Nadu's fractured politics. This was, for the first time, that the charismatic actor, who enjoys a cult status in the Tamil film industry, officially stated his stand on taking a political plunge. Addressing his fans in Chennai, Rajinikanth had said that his entry into politics is ""definite"". He had said he would start his own political party before the Assembly elections, adding that his party will contest all the 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. There has been no word on the independent political party since. While spelling out his plans to enter the political arena, the veteran actor sought a structural change in the politics of Tamil Nadu. ""Democracy is in bad shape right now. All other states have been making fun of us (Tamil Nadu). I will feel guilty if I don't make this decision now."" Quoting a   from the   that stresses the importance of doing one's duty and leaving the rest to the Lord, Rajinikanth had said his decision was a ""compulsion of time"". ""It's time for a truthful, transparent political party. That is my desire, and no one can stand in my way. To start and contest an election with a new party is going to be difficult, but the love and support of my Tamil people will prove my decision right,"" Rajinikanth had said. His announcement came amid political uncertainty in Tamil Nadu after former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's death in December 2016. Rajinikanth's announcement was a big deal, but the happiest among all was the BJP. The BJP unit chief in Tamil Nadu, Tamilisai Soundararajan, had tweeted, welcoming the actor.  also quoted her as saying that Rajinikanth will support the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It is to be noted that the BJP and Rajinikanth's connection goes a long way. Just before Tamil Nadu voted in the Lok Sabha election in 2014, Narendra Modi had met Rajinikanth at his residence, but the meeting was considered only a ""courtesy call"". Two months after Jayalalithaa passed away, Soundararajan had said the list of those joining the BJP  . Back then, calling the party the ""last hope for the nation's growth and to provide a corruption-free administration"", Soundarajan had claimed that ""several anti-corruption crusaders, philanthropists and neutral public figures were joining the party."" That BJP interest in Rajinikanth's entry into Tamil politics can be gauged by Union minister Nitin Gadkari's statement. In an interview in May 2017, he had told   ""He is welcome in politics, and it is my request to him to think about the BJP. There is an appropriate place for him in the party."" In June 2017, RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy, too, had hinted that Rajinikanth may join politics and back the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Speaking to Gurumurthy had said Rajinikanth can be the next MGR of Tamil Nadu politics. There is a major reason why the BJP has been much more inclined towards Rajinikanth than any other actor.   ""For the BJP, Rajinikanth is the only winnable choice. Kamal Haasan could have been an option, but he is seen as too much of a 'straight shooter' in BJP circles. Kamal has a mind of his own and is an atheist, and both won't work for the BJP. Another star, Vijay, whose popularity is second only to Rajinikanth and Haasan and is known to have a political interest, was also considered.""",2018-11-13,"Bharatiya Janata Party,Hindu Terror,Hindutva Politics,Kamal Haasan,Kamal Haasan Politics,Mahabharat,Makkal Needhi Maiam,PoliticalPlay,Rajinikanth,Rajinikanth Politics,Secular Politics,Tamil Nadu,Tamil Nadu BJP,Tamil Politics,Tamilisai Soundararajan","Rajinikanth, Kamal and their divergent politics: Superstar projects allegiance to BJP, Haasan sticks with secular forces",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajinikanth-kamal-and-their-divergent-politics-superstar-projects-allegiance-to-bjp-haasan-sticks-with-secular-forces-5542411.html,firstpost,-1,0
Dinesh Unnikrishnan,"In 1991, the newly-elected prime minister, PV Narasimha Rao, facing one of the biggest ever economic crises India had ever seen, had made a surprise choice for Union finance minister. Rao had inducted economist-turned-central banker Manmohan Singh into his cabinet. Cut to 2019, a political battle, essentially on a clutch of burning economic issues, is set to begin, and the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has a much stronger case to identify another Manmohan Singh — and there is no better choice now than another world-renowned economist, former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan. By any yardstick, Rajan as a prime ministerial candidate in 2019 will be an even more rewarding bet for the UPA when compared to Manmohan Singh in 1991. Rajan has equal, or better, stature than Manmohan as an economist and will be a formidable candidate to counter Narendra Modi in 2019 when the general elections will be fought on major political-economic issues — black money, agrarian crisis, unemployment — a scenario that makes no one better suited than Rajan to lead the country. His words carry immense weight even among world leaders and powerful multilateral institutions. Manmohan handheld the Indian economy when it was on a roller coaster ride in the liberalisation era and also played an instrumental role in boosting the intellectual core of the Congress in the subsequent decades. Getting Rajan back to India and to the centre of political opposition can work even better both for the economy and the party, when the country is, yet again, facing a bout of economic crisis characterised by a weak rupee, agrarian crisis, unemployment and a crisis of confidence between the central bank and the ruling government on a range of contentious issues, to the point of invoking a clause that is fundamentally meant to silence the RBI and force it to consent to government demands. Look closely. The career graphs of both Rajan and Manmohan have striking similarities. Both have served in the Indian government and the central bank and have international repute. Rajan is well aware of the nuances of the Indian political landscape and has stuck his neck out on a number of occasions during his stint at the RBI to speak on socio-political issues. He has commanded a degree of stardom among the informed middle class and even the laymen on the street. If one measures both Rajan and Manmohan on a popularity meter at this point of their career, Rajan would stand a tad ahead of Manmohan, except the fact that he hasn't had his stint in the central ministry yet. However, Rajan carries a star image that can be easily converted to the UPA's political benefit in 2019. Even two years after he left India — he is currently a Professor of Finance at University of Chicago's Booth School of Business — Rajan continues to hold his space in local media and political circles, a reputation that not many former central bank governors can claim. On debates on black money and unemployment, Rajan's words will carry more weight than Modi or any other political leader, at any point. At this point, the UPA has lost its direction on an economic narrative. It's high time the coalition went back to its drawing board and revisited the 1991 Narasimha Rao days to opt for a surprise pick that can offer the Modi-led front a serious challenge. Also, since Rajan is not a representative of any political party at this point, his candidature will be more acceptable to the regional satraps — Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav and   — than Rahul Gandhi's. After the 2014 landslide mandate, Modi made his term all about the economy and economic reform issues. Modi's roadmap began with the Jan Dhan Yojana, banking sector reforms, the Goods and Services Tax, the fight against the parallel economy and the promise of fast-paced manufacturing revolution. Modi progressed on many fronts, while failing to make meaningful impact on other few, but his intent has been unquestionable. It is with this intent and promise of reform-continuity that Modi will face the electorate in 2019. Rahul often appears clueless to challenge Modi's economic campaign with undisputed facts and figures. He had his chances, but unfortunately, Rahul has failed to repeatedly prove that he can emerge as a leader who can be considered prime minister material. Rajan, on the other hand, is a familiar face to the informed middle class voter and can easily relate to the rural populace, given the appeal he cultivated as RBI governor, spearheading the bad loans clean-up campaign and policy reforms. Rahul would do well to   if he wishes to put the UPA's interest above his own. He should give way to a better candidate. In 1991, Manmohan's selection for the finance minister's portfolio surprised many as he, 59 then, was seen as an apolitical technocrat and someone who had spent his whole life practicing economics and academic interests. But the decision was a political necessity for Narasimha Rao and the Congress to convince Manmohan to have an able hand in the government to wade through the economic mess. India was then going through a severe balance of payment crisis, and shoddy economics would have toppled even good politics severely if not approached with extreme caution. In the years that followed, Manmohan evolved beyond the persona of a typical technocrat. Although he never perfected, he gradually learned to walk and talk like a politician. The Opposition called him a puppet dancing to the whims of the Gandhi family and ridiculed his silence on many critical occasions. But Manmohan donned the role of a pillar to give a credible prime ministerial face to the ever-divided UPA house and the unhappy Congress biological system, which developed a tendency to reject leadership elements beyond the Gandhis after the Nehru-Indira era. In 2004 and in 2009, Manmohan continued to be the prime ministerial face of the Congress and was praised and criticised for his own share of contributions and political mistakes. But he remained in office for a decade, giving the party much-needed stability as the UPA's central figure. Of course, times have changed since then, and the Indian economy has changed significantly from the days of the 1991 crisis. But the economy continues to be the central subject in politics. The RBI and the government have   over multiple points in the economy, ranging from the use of foreign exchange reserves, to interest rate policy, to the bad loans clean up. A spectacular turf war is on in full swing. Nearly five years have passed since the last UPA government was thrown out of office when the Modi wave swept the country. Now five years later, the Modi wave may have diminished but has not lost its power. As the 2019 battle approaches, the Congress and the divided house of the UPA is still struggling to find a strong, credible prime ministerial face that can counter Modi. Even those in the Congress would silently agree that its party president is a   for the 2019 polls. Rahul shows no sign of a strong contender who can match Modi in terms of strategy, information and eloquence. In private, even Rahul would admit that him as the prime ministerial candidate would be giving Modi a a walkover in the 2019 match. Going by the way he presents himself while handling serious socio-political issues, one can easily find the panic he tries to hide behind his grin with great difficulty. His arsenal is weak, often filled with superficial information and stage-managed performances, accompanied by his witty social media strategy. But what Rahul lacks is a plan to handle the economy, agrarian crisis and issue of reservation in jobs. The Congress has yet to realise that at this point, the real battlefield is the Indian economy that lacks a strong, credible leader to spearhead its fight on economic grounds against Modi. Rahul still doesn't seem to sense the pulse on the ground despite his innumerable need-based trips to far-flung villages. The only remedy for economic ills that Rahul seems to repeat at his political rallies is farm loan waiver, be it in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, or Kerala. That weapon isn't enough to wage a war on a leader who devised his battle plans on pertinent economic issues from Day 1 in office, even using the UPA's own schemes against it. None of Rahul's moves appear spontaneous and convincing. If anything is working in Rahul's favour, it is the combination of the apparent anti-Modi sentiment in certain quarters. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, till the time he was within the UPA fold, was considered a potential prime ministerial candidate — politically experienced, familiar to the regional satraps' power play, someone with strong knowledge of ground realities and clever in manipulating developing political situations and handling crises. However, Kumar is a long gone bird for the UPA and will be an unwelcome guest even if he manages a last minute U-turn. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar is an old war horse who still has a fighting spirit, but he won't have too many takers in the coalition. Such a depressing void in the prime ministerial seat puts the UPA at a disadvantage and in a state of gross confusion. This is probably the reason why the UPA, barely six months to the Lok Sabha polls, is still unable to pitch a prime ministerial face, with Rahul being the only logical, but very weak, choice. At this point, the UPA doesn't have too many better options than Rajan to field against Modi in 2019. By doing so, Rahul would be elevating his political stature as the kingmaker of the UPA's comeback, rather than embracing a likely defeat under his own prime ministerial candidacy.",2018-11-13,"2009 Lok Sabha Election,Indian Economics,Indian Economy,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Lok Sabha Elections,Manmohan Singh,Narendra Modi,PM Candidate,PoliticialDecoder,Prime Ministerial Candidate,Raghuram Rajan,Raghuram Rajan For PM,Raghuram Rajan Politics,Rahul Gandhi,RBI,UPA","Raghuram Rajan, not Rahul Gandhi, should be UPA's next Manmohan Singh to take on Narendra Modi in 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/raghuram-rajan-not-rahul-gandhi-should-be-upas-next-manmohan-singh-to-take-on-narendra-modi-in-2019-5541311.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The Congress unit in West Bengal is in favour of fighting the coming Lok Sabha election ""alone"" in the state despite the party forging alliances with different regional outfits in other parts of the country in its bid to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The view has been communicated to Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the final call on the issue would be taken by the AICC leadership, West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) president Somen Mitra told PTI. The Congress has already been hit with the exodus of its elected representatives to the Trinamool Congress. The Bengal unit of the Congress feels that an alliance with either the  Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) or the Trinamool Congress will not serve the ""long-term"" interests of the party. Such an eventuality will only further erode the party's base in the state though it had tasted success in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by forging alliances with regional parties, the JD(S) and the Samajwadi Party, the Congress leaders said. ""During my meeting with our party president Rahul Gandhi, I had clearly said that it would be good if we fight the Lok Sabha election alone. We may not win many seats but our party will continue to exist in Bengal in the future,"" Mitra said. ""Forging an alliance with the Trinamool Congress might give us more seats, but it will also ensure that the Congress will cease to exist in Bengal as the TMC is more keen on poaching our MLAs and elected representatives,"" Mitra said. Senior Congress leaders like P Chidambaram have advocated state-wise alliances to defeat the BJP at the Centre. According to state Congress leaders, aligning with the CPM-led Left Front will not serve any purpose as it will not ensure winning seats as the Left itself is facing a rout in the state. ""So we have told the Congress president that it is better for the future of the party in Bengal that we fight the Lok Sabha election alone. Doing so may not ensure too many seats, but it will at least guarantee revival of our organisation in the long run,"" AICC member Subhankar Sarkar said. Congress sources, who did not wish to be named, said one of main reasons behind the decision against aligning with the TMC is that the party is not very sure if it would be offered more than four LS seats, it presently has in the state, by the ruling party. ""Everyone aspires to contest the election on a ticket of the party he has been working with. But due to alliances with the TMC in 2001, 2009 and 2011 and the CPM in 2016, our organisation has suffered badly. We could neither offer seats to our party leaders, nor could we put up our symbols in various seats. That has badly damaged our organisation,"" a senior state Congress leader said. The argument against going for an alliance with the CPM is lack of consistency on the part of the Left Front to remain in an alliance as it had unilaterally walked out of the alliance in 2016 after its defeat in the state assembly polls. There are some leaders within the state unit like Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury, the Congress MP from Malda South and the brother of late party stalwart ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury, his niece Mausam Benazir Noor, also an MP from the same district, who are strongly advocating the Congress-TMC alliance to stop the march of the BJP in West Bengal. Former PCC president and MP Pradip Bhattacharya, who is also chairman of the party co-ordination committee, agreed that the mood of the state leadership is to go alone in the polls. He said, the Assembly election results in five states and the outcome of the all party meeting on 22 November in New Delhi will be crucial and play a deciding factor while chalking out Congress' strategy. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during the TMC's martyrs day rally on 21 July had set the target of winning all the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. ""We don't need anybody in Bengal. We can fight and win on our own,"" a senior TMC leader said. CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty said all secular and democratic forces should come together in order to defeat the BJP and the TMC. Out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, the TMC had won 34 seats, Congress four and the CPM and the BJP two each in 2014. 
The four seats which elected Congress Members of Parliament are in Malda and Murshidabad districts, which were traditional strongholds of Congress but have been penetrated by the TMC. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Congress had contested 14 seats in the state and the TMC in 27 seats while the SUCI in one seat. The Congress had then won six seats, the TMC had 19 seats and the SUCI (C) one.

Saurabh Sharma," The 18 seats that went to polls in   saw a drop of more than 18 percent in voter turnout, despite all out efforts by the state and central governments to motivate tribals to exercise their franchise in the red corridor areas of Chhattisgarh. The press note released by Chief Election Officer of Chhattisgarh Subrat Sahu on Monday evening tallied the   at the 10 ""highly sensitive"" constituencies where voting was held between 7 am and 3 pm at 52 percent, and the turnout at the remaining eight constituencies at 70.08 percent. The average voting percentage for the first phase of 2018 Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh stood at 60.49 percent, against the 78.8 percent voter turnout recorded in these 18 constituencies in the 2013 Assembly elections. Several factors, including the Naxal threat to boycott the elections and the resentment for both Congress and BJP legislators, seem to have contributed to this fall in voter numbers. The prime concern for election authorities was to avoid any loss of life in the polling process, in the aftermath of several brazen Naxal attacks in the run-up to the first phase of the polls. The Naxal resistance was such that two encounters broke out even on polling day — in the   and in   — resulting in the deaths of six insurgents and injuring five security personnel, who had to be airlifted to Jagdalpur. An   was also triggered before polling began, targeting security forces near a booth in Tumakpal-Nayanar Road in Katekalyan area, but no injuries were reported. IED devices were found near polling booths at a couple of other locations in Bijapur and in Bhanupratappur in Kanker and were defused by bomb disposal squads. Election Commission officials said the electorate boycotted the polls in some interior areas of Kanker and Sukma districts. ""The list is being prepared, and we are waiting for the polling parties to return. One such village where the villagers boycotted voting is Aamapani in Kanker. The villagers there were angry about their polling booth being shifted to Thema. As per initial information, our officers tried a lot to convince them, but no one from the village turned up to vote,"" said an election observer, who had come to Kanker from Lucknow on election duty and requested anonymity. Karuna Shukla, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece and the Congress candidate from Rajnandgaon who is challenging incumbent Chief Minister Raman Singh in his home turf, said the low voter turnout reflects the failure of the state machinery. ""In the early hours (of Monday), there were reports that EVMs had malfunctioned at many places, and this was only where TV channels could reach. But what about the interior areas where the media could not reach? We got information that voting started after 10.00 am at many places. So all these factors could be responsible for the fall in voter turnout,"" Shukla explained. However, BJP candidate from Jagdalpur, Santosh Kumar Bafna, refused to accept that the voter turnout has dropped, claiming that the ""actual"" turnout would be higher. ""Let polling parties who are still inside the jungle return. Then the Election Commission will be able to compile the exact data. It is too early to comment on this,"" Bafna said. The constituencies that recorded the largest decline in voter turnout compared to figures from the last Assembly elections were Antagarh (33.75 percent low voter turnout than 2013), Narayanpur (30.38 percent), Kondagaon (22.44 percent), Bhanupratappur (22.26 percent) and Keshkal (20.19 percent). Kanker (17.14 percent), Dongargaon (14.27 percent), Bastar (13.95 percent), Khairagarh (14.26 percent), Dantewada (13.03 percent), Khujji (13.01 percent) and Mohla-Manpur (13.52 percent) also saw a high fall in voter turnout. Ironically, none of the 18 constituencies that went to polls in first phase registered a higher voter turnout than in the 2013 elections, rendering baseless the government's argument in favour of increasing paramilitary presence in the red corridor to include more tribals in the democratic set up. However, security forces were successful in getting votes polled at booths set up at Bhejji, Kistaram and Banda in the Konta Assembly constituency in Sukma district, where zero votes were cast in the 2013 Assembly polls. In 2013, 53 polling booths across Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada in the Bastar division had registered zero votes. The difference between the voter turnout compared to the last elections was the lowest, at 2.19 percent, in the Konta constituency, which saw 46.19 percent voter participation this year. A CRPF commandant from the CoBRA unit posted in Chitrakot, seeking anonymity, said the priority of the armed forces was to ensure that no life is lost during the election process. ""It was definitely a challenging task to ensure peaceful voting without the loss of any life, be it civilian or security personnel. We did our best, and few of our jawans sustained injuries. But the force is happy with the outcome as voting also happened in those places where it could not happen in the last term,"" he said. It was more of a challenge to bring people out to vote, the CRPF official said. ""We had to convince people that there is adequate number of forces on the ground to guard them, but they were still hesitant to step out. They only came out watching others,"" he added. District collectors and returning officers in their respective constituencies declined to comment on the lower voting percentage recorded this year, saying the Election Commission would be able to answer these queries. Mangal Kunjam, an actor who played the role of a journalist in   a Hindi film that depicted the challenges in conducting free and fair voting at a booth located in a Naxal affected area in Chhattisgarh — did not cast his vote out of fear of the insurgents. A resident of Kiroli village in the Kirandul region of Naxal-hit Dantewada district, Kunjam said only a couple of people dared to vote in his village due to the boycott called by Naxals. ""The polling party took a couple of voters with them to the booth amid heavy security. This was done to avoid nil voting like in the last elections,"" the 27-year-old said. Former Naxal Mainuram,  who took up masonry after surrendering five years ago, voted in Narayanpur along with his wife, Rajbati. Voting is everyone's right, and one should practice it for a better government, the 40-year-old now believes. ""There are a lot of security forces to guard us from Naxals and other anti-national forces. I am not scared of anyone because of the police and security forces, and others should also come out to exercise their franchise,"" Mainuram said while speaking to the media after casting his vote. Ram Chandra Baghel, a 45-year-old voter from Chitrakot's Lohandiguda village did not vote because he wants ""to live"". He said only five out of 400 voters in his village exercised their franchise. ""Those five persons who went to vote are government employees, like school teachers and others, who were forced to vote. We know they were also scared,"" he said, adding that Naxals had dropped a   (pamphlet) in his village the night before polling, warning them to not participate in the election process. ""I did not vote because I want to live. Naxals had threatened us of dire consequences, and I want to live with my family. What is there in taking such a risk? Life is above everything,"" Baghel said. Those who voted in Lohandiguda were not untouched by this fear. Kamal Madia, 28, one of the five voters from the village, said he was leaving the village for a few days because he could be punished by the Left-Wing Extremists. ""I do not want my finger to be chopped off. I regret voting. I don't know why I did it. I am going to Bastar for a few days, till this ink fades,"" said a frowning Madia, covering his inked finger. The Election Commission said the total size of the electorate in the first phase of the polls to 18 constituencies was 31,80,014, of which 16,22,492 were women, 15,57,435 men and 87, the third gender. Polling took place at 4,341 booths. Voting began at 7 am and closed by 3 pm in 10 ""highly sensitive"" constituencies — Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta — while it was held between 8 am and 5 pm in the other eight constituencies — Khairgarh, Dongargarh, Rajnandgaon, Dongargaon, Khujji, Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot. Dr Vikram Singh, an expert on political affairs in Chhattisgarh, said the higher voting percentage in the Bastar division in 2013 was due to the sympathy the Congress had gained among the people after the  , in which 12 party leaders were killed. ""The voting percentage in 2013 was high because at that time, the Jhiram (Ghati) incident had happened, where several people, including Congress leaders, were killed. That was a mobilising factor then, but there was nothing as such this time,"" Singh said, adding that another factor that could have kept voters away this year could be the intense anti-election campaign by Naxals, as they carried out at least 15 big and small attacks in the region in the run-up to the polls. The Jhiram Ghati attack of 25 May, 2013, remains one of the deadliest Naxal attacks in the recent past. It claimed 27 lives, including those of Congress leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Vidya Charan Shukla and Mahendra Karma, who was brutally beaten, stabbed and sprayed by bullets by the Naxals. Political parties fielding the same candidates in these 18 seats was another reason behind the low excitement in the electorate, according to Dr Singh. The low voter participation could also be a sign of fair polling, according to Raipur-based political commentator Ashok Tomar. ""Chances of rigging increase when the voter turnout is higher, but this time, it is very much clear that there was fair voting,"" Tomar said, adding that the the threat of Naxals chopping off the fingers of those who voted may have also had an impact on the number of people venturing out to vote.

Press Trust of India,": Voting was underway in 18 Assembly constituencies in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh elections on Monday during which an improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated by Naxals in Dantewada district. A police official said Naxals, who had called for a boycott of the polls, detonated the IED early morning, but no casualty was reported. A thick security blanket, comprising over 1.25 lakh police and paramilitary personnel, was thrown across the 18 constituencies as they fall under the Naxal-hit areas of Bastar, Kanker, Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur, Kondagaon and Rajnandgaon districts. Polling in 10 constituencies — Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta — started at 7 am and would conclude at 3 pm, an election official said. In the other eight constituencies — Khairgarh, Dongargarh, Rajnandgaon, Dongargaon, Khujji, Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot -- voting began at 8 am and would end at 5 pm, he said. 
An IED blast was triggered by Maoists early morning in Dantewada. ""The explosion took place around 5.30 am on Tumakpal-Nayanar road when a team of security men was escorting polling personnel to their booth,"" a senior police official said. ""No harm was caused to the security and polling personnel in the explosion. The polling party safely reached the Nayanar polling booth in Katekalyan area,"" he added. Among the prominent candidates in the first phase were Chief Minister Raman Singh, ministers Kedar Kashyap (Narayanpur) and Mahesh Gagda (Bijpaur) and Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Kanker Lok Sabha seat MP Vikram Usendi (Antagarh). Nine sitting Congress MLAs -- Manoj Singh Mandavi (Bhanupratappur), Mohan Lal Markam (Kondagaon), Lakheshwar Baghel (Bastar), Deepak Kumar Baij (Chitrakot), Devati Karma (Dantewada), Kawasi Lakhma (Konta), Girwar Janghel (Khairagarh), Santram Netam (Keshkal) and Daleshwar Sahu (Dongargaon) — were also in the fray.

Natasha Trivedi,"All the farmers in the Kurna village of Chhattisgarh’s Kanker district agree on one statement — “We have managed to survive because we installed infrastructure for irrigation in our farms ourselves; we did not wait for the government to provide for us.” In 2017, the state government had declared  .   by the lack of rainfall in the Kharif season last year, many of whom are still awaiting the amount they were promised under the crop insurance scheme. In Kurna, one of the villages on the banks of the Mahanadi river in the district’s Narharpur block, around 50 farmers have spent at least Rs 5 lakh from their own pockets to buy equipment for irrigation. This arrangement allows them to make use of their proximity to the vital resource of the river. Some of the farmers invested in a drip irrigation system nearly a decade ago. Jagguram Sahu, a 78-year-old farmer, says, “I got tired of the government’s excuses for the delay in providing irrigation facilities in our village. Even after putting our demands forward repeatedly, nothing happened. So a few of us decided to get it done ourselves around 10 years ago. The next generation has followed our example.” Jagguram owns 14 acres and grows only paddy in both the Kharif and Rabi seasons. He is considered one of the ‘big’ farmers in the village, but he vehemently denies that the irrigation system has earned him any real profit. “I make no extra profit from my yield, even though I am able to grow paddy throughout the year. If we hadn’t put in this system, my family would have probably suffered. So the only benefit is that we have not suffered,” he says. Mahendra Nishad, 55, breaks down the expenditures involved: “In 2008, I spent a total of Rs 5 lakh on the irrigation system, including a 1.5-kilometre-long pipeline and a water pump, and on its installation. I had to take a loan from the bank. Now I spend on electricity and maintenance; there are also added costs of labour, fertiliser, and manure.” However, in spite of the expenses and the fact that nearly all farmers are burdened by debt, they are satisfied with their decision. Toran Maharaj, who owns five acres, says getting their own system installed helped them escape frequent, unfruitful rounds of government offices and allowed them to use good quality equipment. “Even if the administration had given us equipment for irrigation, its quality would not have matched what we bought. The pipes would have been weak and broken easily,” Maharaj says. Surjuram Jurree, an Adivasi farmer, is the oldest of five brothers, all of whom depend on a four-acre farm for their livelihood. “If I hadn’t been able to irrigate my land, I would have no choice but to work as a daily-wage labourer,” he says. In Kurna, farmers have empowered themselves to help each other survive in times of drought like in 2017. The concept of ‘ ’, or ‘dependent farmer’, is followed for those who are not able to afford irrigation systems for their land. Gopiram Sahu is helped by Jagguram, who provides water for at least two acres of Gopiram’s land. “I cannot afford to irrigate my land, so I take help from other farmers. It’s a give and take process. A big farmer provides water for a small farm through equipment used for irrigation, and small farmers work as labourers when they can,” he exlains. “The farming community is finding ways and means to get themselves out of debt without the government’s help.” Bhanbai Sahu, who is also a dependent farmer, pays a neighbor Rs 2,000 every season to be able to use water from his borewell for her farm. “After our land got divided in the family, my husband and I have one and a half acres to our name. Every season, we have to pay to provide the paddy crop with adequate amount of water,” she says. Another dependent farmer, Santosh Sahu has not bought equipment for irrigation because he is scared to take a loan that would add to the debt he already has pending. “I have no money to get my land irrigated on my own, and I’m scared to take another loan. Currently, I only take seasonal loans for fertilisers, which is usually Rs 5,000,” he says. Santosh supplements the income he gets from the three-acre land that is shared by two families by working as a daily-wage labourer. “That money goes towards paying for my children’s education,” he adds. However, while they agree that the government has failed the agrarian community, big farmers are largely supportive of the BJP for their campaign of   (development). “The government has provided free healthcare and rice for Re 1. So the BJP may get more votes than the Congress because the Congress is not entirely trusted,” says Jagguram. However, Gopiram says farmers needed to move past the ‘party’ mindset. “We also need to evaluate the candidate as an individual and then vote. All parties made big promises before the elections, but who knows what they’ll do once they come to power?” he asks. The first phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections are underway, including in the Kanker constituency, which includes the Narharpur block. Currently, the Congress party’s Shankar Dhurwa is the MLA from one of three constituencies in the district.

Singling out the Gandhis, Modi said the ""mother-son duo were out on bail"" and hit out at them for questioning the government's demonetisation move. Without naming the Gandhis, he said ""they should not forget"" that it was due to the note ban move that they ""had to seek bail"".

Which ""hand"" (election symbol of the Congress) had siphoned off the remaining 85 paise, Modi asked. Congress never got a leadership which worked with a resolution of ""living or dying for the welfare of the nation"", Modi said. Chhattisgarh may have taken 50 years to attain the present level of development had it still been ruled by the Rahul Gandhi-led party, he said. ""And there is a reason for it.

FP Staff,"Chhattisgarh kick-started the Assembly elections to five states this year, as 18 constituencies voted in the first phase of the polls. Voting in nine seats of the Bastar division and one seat in Rajnandgaon district began at 7 am  — Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta — and concluded at 3 pm. The other eight seats — Khairgarh, Dongargarh, Rajnandgaon, Dongargaon, Khujji, Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot — it started at 8 am and ended at 5 pm. Till 4.30 pm, 56.58 percent voter turnout was recorded in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. This includes a   turnout of 61.47 percent in Kondagaon; 63.51 percent in Keshkal; 62 percent in Kanker; 58 percent in Bastar; 49 percent in Dantewada; 60.5 percent in Khairagarh; 64 percent in Dongargarh; and 65.5 percent in Khujji. Till 3.45 pm, the turnout in Bhanupratappur  was at 57 percent, in Jagdalpur  at 54 percent, Chitrakot  at 57 percent, and Mohala-Manpur at 67 percent. Voting was moderate in the morning even as Naxals attempted to disrupt the polling process by planting multiple IEDs in various parts of the Chhattisgarh. Naxals had called for a boycott of the election and executed over half a dozen attacks in the past 15 days, of which three major ones left 13 people dead, including a video journalist of national broadcaster   who was covering the election campaign. Naxals also threatened voters of consequences if they went out to vote. The 18 constituencies that voted in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh polls fall under the Naxal-hit areas of Bastar, Kanker, Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur, Kondagaon and Rajnandgaon districts. As a result, a thick security blanket, comprising over 1.25 lakh police and paramilitary personnel, was deployed across the region. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally in the state's Bilaspur district, which will vote in the second phase of the polls. Earlier in the day, he had urged voters to go out in large numbers and cast their ballots.

Polling began on a slow note in many constituencies and gradually picked up momentum, the official had said, adding that 31 electronic voting machines (EVMs) and 51 voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines were replaced due to technical snags. Sukma's Superintendent of Police Abhishek Meena had said voters from interior areas in the district had come out to exercise their right to franchise, defying the Naxals' call for an election boycott. At the 'Bhejji 2' and Gorkha polling booths, zero voting was recorded in the 2013 polls, but this time, 11 and 20 voters, respectively, had voted in the initial hours. At the 'Bhejji 1' polling station, where only one vote was cast in the last polls, 72 people voted this time, Meena said. Five Naxals were killed and five soldiers of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) were injured in an   on Monday, even as polling was underway for the first phase of the state elections.

As per preliminary information, a group Naxalites opened fire on the patrolling team of CoBRA, a elite unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), he said. However, the ultras fled from the spot after security personnel retaliated. Reinforcement was rushed to the spot and efforts were made to evacuate the injured commandos by a helicopter. An improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated early morning in Dantewada district by Naxals, who had called for a boycott of the polls, police said. Earlier, Naxals detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) weighing 1 to 2 kilograms near the Tumakpal camp in the Katekalyan block.

Modi asserted the BJP was for development and that it was due to this commitment that the opposition was unable to understand how to compete with ruling party in elections. He also targeted the Congress president, saying when Congress released its 36-point manifesto for Chhattisgarh polls,   (Rahul Gandhi) was referred to as 'Sir' 150 times which shows he is more important for them (Congress) than Chhattisgarh. Phase 1 of the Chhattisgarh elections saw a much higher voter turnout than expected, even at the polling station in Naxal-affected Manpur's Pardoni village, where insurgents had put up posters and banners asking people to boycott the elections.

People in Dantewada's Madenda village also cast their votes even after threats from Naxal that they would cut their fingers if found inked.

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and the Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the electoral politics of Chhattisgarh.

Out of the total 900 registered voters at the Sulangi polling booth in Koyalibeda village of Kanker, only 120 votes were polled until 2 pm. The slow voting is reported to be due to repeated EVM malfunctioning at the booth. Two IED bombs weighing 5kg and 10 kg, respectively, were found in a village at Bhanupratappur Assembly constituency. The bombs were in Kodekurse police station limits and were diffused by the Bomb Disposal Squad. Palamadagu polling booth in Konta constituency is one of the booths where no votes have been caste until 12 pm.

Urging voters to come out in large numbers to cast their vote, Modi said that only by voting can they respond to those who rely on the powers of ""bam, bandook aur pistol"". Voters in Jagdalpur's Gandhi Nagar ward protested outside the polling centre as they alleged that the names of many voters were missing from the voting list ""including those who have been living here for the past 25 years"". Congress' TS Singh who is presently the strongest contender for the chief minister's post in Chattisgarh told   said that there is no chance of any post-poll alliance with Ajit Jogi. ""If there is no pre-poll alliance then there will not be any post-poll alliance. We will not go with the party whose party chief is so controversial. There are chances that the Congress party may go with like-minded parties but definitely not with Jogi,"" Deo said. He also said that the chief minister will be from the Congress if the party forms its government in the state. Mortal remains of BSF Sub-Inspector Mahender Singh who lost his life in an IED blast in Chhattisgarh's Kanker on Sunday, were brought to his residence in Dumariya village in the Bharatpur district. A thick security blanket, comprising over 1.25 lakh police and paramilitary personnel, has been thrown across the 18 constituencies as they fall under the Naxal-hit areas of Bastar, Kanker, Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur, Kondagaon and Rajnandgaon districts. Meanwhile, thirty-one EVMs and 61 VVPAT machines were replaced due to technical snags, a poll official said.

In 'Bhejji 1' polling station, where last time only one vote was cast, 72 people had voted so far this time, Meena told PTI. According to sources, Naxals have punished many tribals and villagers who were trying to raise awareness for voting in their areas. A woman from the Madia tribe who belongs to Kirandul was beaten black and blue when she attended the rally of Rahul Gandhi in Bastar on 9 November. She had come to attend Rahul's rally after someone told her that she will be given some jewellery for attending it but she did not get that also. She was beaten in front of her family and other tribals. However, no police complaint has been filed in the case so far. Meanwhile, the local police in Bastar is saying that such incidents also took place in Dantewada, Sukma and few more areas on Sunday. There are several seats where the BJP has repeated its candidate, compounding the anti-incumbency. In Dongargarh, for example, The BJP has fielded Sarojini Banjare from the Dongargarh seat again. However, local residents believe that a new candidate would have stood a chance at negating the sentiment. The Congress, on the other hand, has fielded a new face, Bhuvneshwar Baghel, replacing Dhanesh Patila, who lost the previous three elections from Dongargarh. , that his main target is BJP. But he has promised a few things in his manifesto that is identical to the Congress, like the MSP for paddy at Rs 2,500 and more local jobs. He said the farmers are worse off under Narendra Modi and Raman Singh. His close aides off the record said they would prefer a post-poll alliance with Congress, provided Jogi gets the chief ministership. Close to zero voting recorded at several booths in Dantewada till 10 am. Aranpur-01, Nahadi-0, Jabeli-03, Kikripara-0, Potali-0, Nilavaya-0, Dokapara-0, Purengel-0. Voter turnout till 11 am: Mohla Manpur 37%, Rajnandgaon 15%. Overall, 16.24% voter turnout has been recorded so far in the first phase of polls. What has kept Raman Singh so far in the game is his policy of providing rice at Re 1 per kg. In some of the poorer constituencies of the state, voters say it has kept them alive, even as their lives have otherwise not been alleviated. However, in a last-ditch attempt to woo its voters, Raman Singh has distributed mobile phones to them. But it is unlikely to make an impact. Voters say they need jobs, not freebies. The authorities are having a tough time in bringing out the voters in the Lohandiguda block which falls under the Chitrakoot Vidhan Sabha. Lohandiguda is the same area where the land of tribals was acquired forcefully to set up a Tata Steel plant but Tata had to back out from the project due to protests by tribal. Ever since then, tribals have not received agricultural benefits of the government for farming on their own land. Recently, Congress President Rahul Gandhi promised the tribal that he will get their land rights back to them in ten working days and will not allow any corporate to acquire the land. Outside the tribal areas, the major crop in   is rice, which requires a lot of water. Farmers have said that the irrigation facilities are in shambles, and they can’t cultivate rice if the monsoon deserts the region. Paddy’s   of Rs 1,750 is also inadequate, and the Congress is trying to   the sentiment by promising Rs 2,500   for rice. One of the things that are going against Raman Singh is that he had not declared bonus for paddy farmers for two years. Senior Congress leader and party in charge of Chhattisgarh, PL Punia has alleged that the state machinery has planned massive rigging at polling booths in remote areas of the Maoist affected districts. Chief Minister Raman Singh urges people of   to vote in large numbers Singh said that the vote of citizens is the biggest strength of the nation. In 2013, 68 polling stations tallied at 0 votes, and more than 80 booth recorded less than 20 votes, largely due to Maoist threats. That number is likely to go down. A sort of a generation gap may be unfolding between the voters and non-voters and the younger generation knows the importance of schools, hospitals, roads and connectivity. Therefore, they are more likely to defy the "" , as Maoists are called in the region. The BJP government’s decision to reduce MSPs on forest produce has had an adverse impact as well. Lac (a resin used in varnishes),   seeds (a source of soap-nut oil) and flowers (used to make alcohol) and Sal (Shorea-robusta) are some of the minor forest products, whose MSPs have been slashed dramatically by the state. This has endangered the livelihoods of the tribals. There is a strong undercurrent for change on the ground, in spite of the Ajit Jogi factor. It is driven by farm crisis, Raman Singh’s policies towards tribal areas, and growing joblessness. While the younger generation is not as staunchly opposed to industries as their parents might be, they clearly say they don’t trust the state and corporations to carry out fair rehabilitation and compensation policy. Even a seats like Jagdalpur, which the BJP has not lost since Chhattisgarh was formed, is headed for a close finish. Besides its opponents, the  . The Congress has said that Raman's  were an attempt to take the focus away from real issues like corruption. The BJP, however, said that Congress does not pose a threat to it. Dharamlal Kaushik, president of BJP in Chhattisgarh, said, ""Congress was once a national party but it is now a regional party. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it is hanging on to other parties. It is no threat to us. We will form the government for the fourth time as well. We will win 65 seats this time.""  elections are different from other Assembly elections in the sense that the voters in the state are driven by local issues and not ""national"" issues.

Voters had to wait for a good hour and a half before the process started at these booths.

The Chhattisgarh administration and state has taken several measures to facilitate as many voters as possible. Fifty drones and 1,000 satellite trackers are being used in Bastar and at least 60,000 additional security forces have been deployed.  in Chhattisgarh. It has been overshadowed by the incessant focus on the Rajnandgaon seat, from where Raman Singh is up against Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece, Karuna Shukla, who is contesting the Assembly polls on a Congress ticket. Amid threats of Maoist violence, 18 of the 90 constituencies in Chhattisgarh will go to the polls on Monday to elect a new Assembly in the first phase of a battle in which the Congress is desperate to end 15 years of BJP rule. Under the leadership of Raman Singh in the last 15 years, Adivasi land and forests have been opened up for commercial exploitation to the private players, resulting in widespread displacement, measly compensation, and exploitation and pollution of resources. The tribals of Bastar are commonly fighting battles, like the one in Chitrakoot. In the poll-bound state’s insurgency-hit Bastar division, Bhima and 46 other farmers in villages around the Bacheli mining township have lost at least two to five acres of land and are suffering reduced crop production due to  . The election, widely seen as a 'semi-final' ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, will also see a formidable third factor in an alliance stitched by Mayawati's BSP with the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress Chhattisgarh of former chief minister Ajit Jogi and the CPI. A total of 190 candidates are in the fray in the 18 constituencies spread over eight districts, where Maoists have been active for over a quarter century. Chief Minister Raman Singh is vying for a fourth consecutive term, and his main opponent is BJP-turned-Congress leader Karuna Shukla, a niece of late prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In the high stakes battle in Chhattisgarh, Shukla, a former BJP Lok Sabha member, has taken on Raman Singh at his home turf Rajnandgaon. The other constituencies that will see voting are Khairagarh, Dongargarh, Dongargaon, Khujji, Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Bastar, Jagdalpur, Chitrakot, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta.

Vandana Agrawal," Authorities in Chhattisgarh succeeded in bringing more tribals into the democratic process, with the   in the state recording a voter turnout of 70 percent. However, Naxals in the Bastar region targeted security forces and candidates at several places. On Monday,   broke out in Pamed area of Bijapur district, and an IED bomb went off barely a kilometre-and-a-half away from a polling booth in Tumakpal, near Katekalyan area in Dantewada. IED bombs were also found near polling booths and defused successfully in Konta and Bijapur. In Palam Adagu village in Sukma, voting was conducted for the first time in 18 years since Chhattisgarh was formed. Several such polling booths were set up this time in villages across Dantewada, Sukma and Bijapur districts where voting hadn’t been conducted since the state came into being. Election Commission data gave details for the voter turnout till 4.30 pm in Kondagaon (61.47 percent), Bastar (58 percent), Keshkal (63.51 percent), Kanker (62 percent), Khairagarh (60.5 percent), Dongargarh (64 percent), Khujji (65.5 percent) and Dantewada (49 percent). Sukma, one of the districts most severely affected by left-wing Extremism, recorded 45 percent polling till 4.30 pm. Narayanpur, another such district, recorded a 63 percent voter turnout. Urban areas recorded 58 percent polling. A total of 18 constituencies went to the polls in the first phase on Monday. Till 5.30 pm, the overall voter turnout was 58.55 per cent. The state had recorded a voter turnout of 77.12 percent in the last Assembly elections of 2013. Chief Electoral Officer Subrat Sahu said the polling process was peaceful overall, apart from minor incidents of Naxal violence. Sahu said that 70 VVPATs and 40 EVMs were replaced, while some EVMs had to be repaired. The second phase of voting in Chhattisgarh for the remaining 72 seats is scheduled on 20 November. BJP MP from Kanker, Vikram Usendi, who is contesting the Antagarh seat said, ""The enthusiasm of the people was worth seeing. In the last 15 years, the faith gained by Raman Singh has sent people in huge numbers for voting. I have no doubt of my victory."" Karuna Shukla, who is contesting against Raman Singh in Rajnandgaon, said, ""While I am the niece of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I worked at all levels — from the ward to the nation. I worked for 34 years in the BJP. The culture that Atal Bihari Vajpayee instilled is within me, but the BJP is far from it. Raman Singh is not a challenge for me; I am a challenge for Raman Singh."" In this election, an upbeat Congress appears confident of gaining from the anti-incumbency of 15 years of the Raman Singh-led BJP government. Another contender is Ajit Jogi, the former Congress chief minister of the state, who is challenging the big two national parties with his new party, Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC), which is in alliance with Mayawati’s BSP and the CPI. Other parties in the fray include the CPM and Gondwana Republican Party. In the last Assembly elections of 2013, while the BJP had managed to get 49 seats, the Congress was restricted to 39 seats. BSP and Independent candidates recorded their victory on one seat each. However, the vote difference between the two national parties was only 0.75 percent. The Maoist diktat of boycotting elections is not a new phenomenon in Bastar. This year though, trapped between the state's attempt to ensure voting and the Maoist boycott threats, tribals from the 12 seats under Bastar division had demanded in the first week of November that the voting ink not be put on their fingers in order to keep the identity of voters safe from Naxals. The State Election Commission sent a proposal regarding this demand to the Central Election Commission, but the request was not considered. The government may claim that the Maoist movement has been curbed in Chhattisgarh under the NDA rule, but non-stop attacks by Naxals depict a different picture of the conflict-ridden region. It is true that the pressure of the security forces on the Maoists in Chhattisgarh has increased and the security forces have succeeded in regaining much of the territory under the Maoists’ influence. But that hasn’t translated into reduced attacks by the Maoists. This year too, while Maoists have been attacked, the security forces have suffered major losses.

Sanjib Kr Baruah,"The tranquillity in Mizoram hides a 20-year-old violent past when Laldenga’s Mizo National Front (MNF) led an incessant armed insurgency till 1986 when an accord was signed. After Laldenga’s demise, his close aide Zoramthanga took over the MNF and has been the chief minister of the state for two consecutive terms till 2008 before losing power to the Congress’ Lal Thanhawla who is the incumbent chief minister. With polls slated for 28 November and on a comeback trail, Zoramthanga, a sprightly 74, spoke to  . Excerpts from the interview: Because of the lack of development and the lifting of prohibition and allowing the sale of liquor as well as the mismanagement of the financial position, people are really fed up of the present government. Moreover, there is big anti-incumbency, so we believe we shall be able to form the next government. Many people say the Congress will not even get 10 seats. All political pointers are also indicating as such. There are other priorities too. One of the biggest issues that have to be dealt with is acquiring self-sufficiency of food. Mizoram has a lot of cultivable areas where farming is not happening. But if we cultivate and mechanise it appropriately, it is quite sufficient to feed the whole population of Mizoram three-four times over. We should focus not just on rice but also in winter crops and vegetables like wheat, onions etc. and also undertake more cropping seasons. In October, if we harvest the rice, the next five months are ideal for vegetables which thrive very well in such conditions. Besides self-sufficiency in food, it can also bring more income to the people. Another aspect of this is to properly identify the crops and take steps for their processing and marketing. The other priority is development, specifically in the sense of building link or arterial roads. It is one of my personal aims. Unless we link our agricultural and forest potential with every village in the state and replace the present ‘head load’ system, the economy cannot progress. I must bring out the importance of bamboo here. We need tissue culture and modern laboratories to grow bamboo seedlings so that we are able to produce bamboo in bigger amounts. A lot of this kind of research is happening in Hosur (in Tamil Nadu) which we need to replicate. With such facilities we will be able to produce huge quantities of bamboo. It will be the green gold of Mizoram. And in 10 years time, not five years as bamboo needs five years just to mature, I believe we will be able to reap the fruits in seven, eight, or 10 years. My final intention is to make bamboo the total substitute for timber. Yes, it is. Again coming back to bamboo, organic crops need organic fertilisers. Here we should again focus on bamboo. While making bamboo vinegar, we have some residual leftover in a concentrated form which when diluted with water can be very good for organic farming as it makes an excellent for organic fertiliser. After prohibition has been lifted in Mizoram about four years ago, more than 500 policemen have died because of this cheap and low grade liquor that is brought in from outside. More than 6,000-7,000 local people have died because of alcohol consumption. It is like a big plague. This was the argument of the anti prohibitionists in the beginning. On the contrary, after easing prohibition, drug consumption has only increased. All statistics indicate that. Once you slip in one line, you will also slip in the other line. So lifting of prohibition is a very dangerous thing for Mizoram. The moot point here is financial mismanagement. Whatever little revenue the state gets should be used as seed money for furthering socio-economic development which has not been happening. It is in a state of total shambles. Firstly, even the Church is an NGO. Mizo society is a very regimented society. And whenever the Church and NGOs take a total stand against a certain issue, there are no two ways to it. That way there is no survival in politics, as is the case with prohibition this time. It has become the headache of every parent here. That is why the present chief minister is renovating his old house. He knows he is not coming back to power. Absolutely. That is why it is so regimented and so controlled. It has been like this from the beginning. Yes, it works very well. Pre-election community feasts where huge amounts are spent have totally stopped.",2018-11-12,"Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Lal Thanhawla,Laldenga,Mizo National Front,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Politics,VeryCloseUp,Zoramthanga","Mizoram polls: At 74, MNF chief Zoramthanga is in comeback mode, says 'Congress won't even get 10 seats'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-at-74-mnf-chief-zoramthanga-is-in-comeback-mode-says-congress-wont-even-get-10-seats-5537851.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said Monday his government had no role in the summoning of the Badals and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar by a special investigation team (SIT) probing a sacrilege and police-firing case three years ago. ""The SIT was an independent entity and was functioning without any government interference,"" Singh said in response to a question after inaugurating the Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospitalin Sangrur. ""The government's job was to form the SIT as per the unanimous decision of the Assembly,"" the chief minister said, adding that the onus of investigation was on the probe team now. The SIT is probing police firings at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot in 2015 after a series of sacrilege incidents in the state. Two persons were killed in the firing at Behbal Kalan. On Sunday, it had summoned former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son, Sukhbir Singh Badal and actor Akshay Kumar. To a question on the ongoing teachers' protest, the chief minister said the government had given a fair offer to teachers to either join regular services as probationers or continue on contract basis. He added that it was up to them to accept or reject the offer. On the issue of shortage of doctors in government hospitals, he said as many as 588 doctors would be posted shortly in all hospitals. The chief minister said he was in favour of posting of doctors close to their place of residence to ensure more effective functioning.",2018-11-12,"Akshay Kumar,Amarinder Singh,Behbal Kalan,Faridkot,Kotkapura,NewsTracker,Parkash Singh Badal,Punjab,Sacrilege Case,Sacrilege Controversy,Sangrur,Sukhbir Singh Badal","Sacrilege row: Amarinder Singh says Punjab govt has no role in SIT summons to Parkash Singh, Sukhbir Singh Badal, Akshay Kumar",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sacrilege-row-amarinder-singh-says-punjab-govt-has-no-role-in-sit-summons-to-parkash-singh-sukhbir-singh-badal-akshay-kumar-5538861.html,firstpost,-1,0
Srinivasa Prasad,"For some 20 years, there have been references to an ‘A group’ or an ‘A factor’ in the Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Such references are made on the very rare occasions when the usually grim-faced and straight-jacketed BJP functionaries lapse into jovial banter about what goes on inside their party. Even in these mirthful sessions, this “A group” was never called an “A team” perhaps for fear that it might spark speculation on who formed the “B” team. And the “A” meant different things at different times. There was a time when “A” began to mean LK Advani. Then it began to mean either Advani or Ananth Kumar, who  . It didn’t matter which one, because Advani and Ananth Kumar were once part of one powerful group within the party. At some point, the “A” stood for Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Then the “A” began to mean either Atal or Ananth Kumar. It didn’t matter which one, because Ananth Kumar knew what was in Vajpayee’s mind. The “A group” disappeared with the rise of Narendra Modi on the political scene, since Kumar was identified with Advani who had no love for the Gujarat chief minister. And since Modi, according to those who knew him well, had no qualms about unceremoniously ditching whoever cocked a snook at him, there were serious questions about where Kumar stood. But soon that situation changed. Rajnath Singh, then the party president, gave Kumar the job of “talking” to whoever was not warming up to Modi. So Kumar prevailed upon his own mentor Advani and the likes of Sushma Swaraj to do the needful. It is a different matter whether Advani and Sushma wholeheartedly accepted Modi’s leadership, but Kumar himself had decided to abide by the majority view within the BJP in favour of the new leader. And when Modi became the prime minister, Kumar became part of his cabinet. Then it was only a matter of time before the new party president Amit Shah decided that Kumar was a man he could depend upon as far as the Karnataka unit of the BJP was concerned. So the ‘A group’ came back: this time, the ‘A’ standing for either Amit Shah or Ananth Kumar. Kumar was a favourite of everybody, and had friends in every political party, not just in BJP. Such friendships can be useful when parties fall short of numbers. Above everything, he was a splendid persuader. I still remember that afternoon in 1995, when he walked into the office of the newspaper where I worked. With a smile that was permanent on his face, he said the BJP had been receiving “disproportionately low” publicity in our newspaper. I denied any deliberate cold shoulder to the BJP, saying that ruling parties generally tended to take up more media coverage at least in terms of volume. He then fished out from his pocket a notebook which had on it a “comparative statistical analysis” of the coverage we gave to Janata Dal (then the ruling party), Congress and BJP. We did a random check and he seemed right. And we did indeed do something about it, even if it meant covering the speeches of his party’s leaders only slightly more than before. Kumar made it a point to make friends in the media, though as one devoted to the party, he never gave out much significant information, aside from an occasional, innocuous snippet which reporters would foolishly consider a scoop that would alter India’s future political course. Amit Shah’s discovery of Ananth Kumar’s usefulness was not surprising. After BS Yeddyurappa had returned to the party in 2014 and become the state unit president once again in 2016, the party was politically stronger but was in an intractable organisational mess. (Yeddyurappa had quit as the BJP chief minister in 2011 over the mining scam and floated a regional party called Karnataka Janata Paksha the next year.) With his clout among his upper-caste Lingayats, Yeddyurappa brought back some political muscle to the BJP, but the party was divided by factionalism with no clear and methodical agenda aimed at defeating Congress in the 2018 assembly election, something which Shah wanted. There is no denying that Yeddyurappa and Kumar together were responsible for BJP’s remarkable growth in Karnataka. The BJP grew from just a 3.88 percent vote share and two seats in the Assembly in 1985 to 33.86 percent vote share and 110 seats in 2008 when the party formed a government on its own for the first time. Yeddyurappa’s exit cost the BJP heavily in the 2013 election, when it was reduced to 19.97 percent votes and 40 seats. But after his return, the party’s graph climbed up to 36.3 percent votes and 104 seats in the Assembly elections in May this year. The government formed by him, however, lasted only six days till chief minister   of the coalition of Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress took over after a nail-biting drama. Yeddyurappa contributed to this growth with his caste clout and organisational skills. Besides organisational prowess, Kumar was strong on strategy and had a humble, disarming way of dealing with party members who see Yeddyurappa as abrasive and dictatorial. Both had a love-hate relationship, and the central leadership had all along done the best it could: it confined Yeddyurappa to Karnataka while pitch-forking Kumar in national politics. Kumar had made no secret of his ambition to become the state’s chief minister. Before floating his own party in 2012, Yeddyurappa accused Advani of having forced his resignation to install Kumar in his place. Many in the party, who believe that Kumar was never given the due he deserved in BJP, feel that if indeed he was made the chief minister, the party might have been better off today. Though critical of Yeddyurappa, Kumar, unlike other senior leaders, didn’t actively nurture a faction of his own, a quality that endeared him to the central leadership. But it wasn’t easy to bring Kumar to state politics to replace Yeddyurappa. That could mean losing Yeddyurappa and the votes of his Lingayat caste. But the wily Amit Shah might have thought of giving Ananth Kumar some significant responsibility in Karnataka affairs, considering the mess that the BJP is in in the state and keeping in view how important the state is for the party. The loss of Ananth Kumar leaves a vacuum that isn’t easy for BJP to fill. His death came as a blow just when the party needed him most.",2018-11-12,"Amit Shah,Ananth Kumar,Ananth Kumar Death,BJP,BS Yeddyurappa,InMemoriam,Karnataka,LK Advani,Narendra Modi",Ananth Kumar was everybody’s favourite; his death comes at a time when BJP in Karnataka needed him most,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ananth-kumar-was-everybodys-favourite-his-death-comes-at-a-time-when-bjp-in-karnataka-needed-him-most-5538871.html,firstpost,-1,0
Manish Kumar," Around 10 kilometers from Raigarh Railway Station lies the new Lakha village, which the Chhattisgarh government had carved out about a decade ago after displacing around 400 households from the low-lying area of erstwhile Lakha, around 3 kilometers from Raigarh. The BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh government had completely evacuated the old village, located near the Kelo river, and shifted the villagers to the new location in an elevated area. This, as the ambitious Kelo Dam project came up in the region where the old Lakha village was located. As many as 186 joint families lived in this village. While the residents of Lakha and Dhanot villages were completely displaced when the Kelo Dam was built in 2012, residents of three other villages were partially affected. The new Lakha village is now juxtaposed to the Raigarh-Ambikapur State Highway and is plagued by fly-ash and industrial dust from the nearby steel industries. Commuters also find it hard to travel by the poorly constructed road. After being moved from the low-lying fertile land to a new area, which lacks any agricultural properties or water resources, the villagers feel cheated by the incumbent BJP government in Chhattisgarh. As a result, many in Lakha have vowed to boycott the BJP, which, they allege, never cared for them. Sashika Gadtia, a resident of Lakha village, had lost her land when they were moved to the new location. Nearly a decade has passed, but she is still waiting to get full compensation from the Chhattisgarh government. As a result, Sashika said she is determined to boycott the BJP during the Assembly elections, as it was Chief Minister Raman Singh’s party that had deprived the villagers of their rights and nearly ruined the lives of many. ""I am ready to wave black flags at BJP leaders who visit our village for campaigning. It is the BJP government that ruined our lives. We were happily living in the low-lying Lakha village. It had a river nearby, fertile land, ponds and wells. The new village neither has fertile soil and farming land, nor ample water,"" she said. She also said she was handed a cheque of Rs 6 lakh by the chief minister himself during his Vikas Yatra  , but she had received only Rs 2 lakh when she converted it at the bank. She claimed it was a ""fake cheque"". Sashika isn't alone in opening up about her woes and firing shots against the BJP. Lalit Gupta, another aggrieved person from the Lakha village, said he has dues amounting to Rs 7.5 lakh from the BJP government in Chhattisgarh. ""Besides the pending compensation, the village has suffered a lot. The new area lies near the highway, which is highly polluted with a lot of dust. The children are also facing the impact of the displacement. There are few amenities here to support our livelihood."" Villagers claim that the farmers who owned land in the old Lakha village were the worst hit, as they had lost their entire means of living to the dam built on the Kelo river, a tributary of the Mahanadi river in the drought-prone Raigarh district. ""Most farmers lost their lands. In our old village, we would grow vegetables among other crops. The soil was very fertile. But in the new village, the soil is not fit for agriculture. The water from borewells is used for electricity, as well,"" said Kanu Ram, a septuagenarian resident of the village. Others allege that the BJP government had taken over fertile lands, and compensations were handed out hurriedly at low prices. Many villagers said that during the displacement phase, authorities had promised them higher prices for the lands acquired, but that never came through. Gopal Agrawal, who is well-versed with the process of compensation and had been keeping track of all announcements, documentation and sanctions, has been going from pillar to post at government offices, seeking justice. ""As per the government's own figures, around 400 households were displaced. While all of them got plots in the new area for houses, no one has been compensated for their   (land). I have been keeping track of this and following up, but in vain,"" he said, adding that the government has yet to hand over Rs 500 crore to the village. ""I was entitled to Rs 11 lakh for my land. The government had been boasting that they are doing  (development) What kind of vikas are they doing if the people who lost their land have not been compensated yet?"" Agrawal asked. Many elders also said there were anomalies in the disbursement of compensation. ""When the compensation provided was examined during the displacement process, many fertile areas were shown as wastelands and were declined for compensation,"" another villager said. The villagers said they have been receiving subsidised rice from the Chhattisgarh government — 7 kilograms per person, per month. Many questioned that while other dam-displaced villages in Chhattisgarh had been compensated, why was the BJP government subjecting Lakha and Dhanot villages to such step-motherly behaviour and then aggressively campaigning for the elections. The villagers said the name 'Lakha' was derived from two words — 'La' and 'Kha', which denote the tendency and virtue of the village to be able to use and consume resources from the nearby forest. Their proximity to natural resources from all sides in the old village had made the villagers self-sufficient. Environmentalists are miffed over the Kelo Dam, which was envisaged for irrigation purposes and to support the nearby industries. They allege that the project is hardly giving importance to irrigation, even after so many years have passed since the construction of the dam was completed. Noted environmentalist from Raigarh, Ramesh Agrawal said: ""When the government proposed to build the dam, it had promised to give water to the nearby villages for irrigation. But around six years have passed, and not a single canal has been constructed for irrigation. The government, however, has ensured that water from the dam goes to the industries."" Activists also alleged that the nearby industries had turned the dam into a drain, dumping their waste into the water and making it increasingly polluted. Scrutiny and checks for such actions are negligent here, they claimed.",2018-11-12,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Election News,Chhattisgarh Elections,Chhattisgarh Polls,Kelo Dam,Lakha Vilage,Mahanadi,TheySaidIt","Residents of Chhattisgarh's Lakha village, displaced for construction of Kelo Dam, vow to boycott BJP in polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/residents-of-chhattisgarhs-lakha-village-displaced-for-construction-of-kelo-dam-vow-to-boycott-bjp-in-polls-5537071.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": The BJP on Saturday promised to make Chhattisgarh a ""Naxal-free"" state and give pension to small and marginal farmers, as the ruling party released its manifesto for the upcoming Assembly polls. Seeking a fourth straight term in the tribal-dominated state, the party also promised to set up multi-specialty hospitals and take the state towards prosperity. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah and Chief Minister Raman Singh released the party's manifesto in Raipur, called  , two days ahead of the first phase of voting on 12 November. Shah said in the last 15 years, the BJP under Raman Singh had transformed Chhattisgarh from a   (laggard) state to a developed one and will now take it ""towards prosperity"".  - an acronym formed with the first letters of the names of the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh - was coined in the mid-1980s to refer to the poor economic conditions prevailing in those states. Singh hit out at the Opposition Congress for offering sops to farmers in its manifesto. ""The Congress has always considered farmers as its vote bank. The party was responsible for the pathetic condition of farmers. When it was in power from 2004 to 2014 (at the Centre), it did not think about implementing the Swaminathan 
Committee report but now they are talking about it in the state,"" he said. The chief minister said if elected to power, his party will give Rs 1,000 per month as pension to small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural labourers aged above 60 years, as well as two lakh new pump connections to cultivators in the next five years. The BJP manifesto also provisioned one-and-a-half times hike in the minimum support price (MSP) for minor forest produce and promised that the state government will purchase pulses and lentils at the MSP along with developing Chhattisgarh as an organic farming state. The manifesto also included that the state will be made free of Naxalism. It promised interest free loans to the tune of  Rs 2 lakh to women for setting up their business and of Rs 5 lakh to self-help groups (SHGs). ""District hospitals will be developed as multi-specialty hospitals, while super-specialty hospitals will be set up in Ambikapur and Jagdalpur,"" Singh said. The manifesto also provisioned a new university to promote Hindi and Chhattisgarhi languages and a medical allowance of Rs 1,000 per month to pensioners. ""Chhattisgarh will be developed as a popular tourist destination and a film city will also be created,"" Singh said. The manifesto promised a milk revolution and cow sanctuaries in all divisions of the state. Listing out achievements of the 15-year rule of Singh-led BJP government in the state on the occasion, Shah said Chhattisgarh was now being counted among developed states. ""Chhattisgarh has emerged as a cement, power, steel and education hub under the Raman Singh government and now it is being converted into a digital hub,"" he said. ""The   reflects the vision to develop the state as a 'Nava Chhattisgarh' (new Chhattisgarh) in the next five years,"" he said.

It is the only state which witnessed 10 times hike in the budget in 15 years,"" the BJP chief said. He said the state government has successfully contained Naxalism and almost wiped out the menace from the state. Reacting to the BJP's manifesto, the Congress said there was nothing new in it.

Asian News International,": Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday came down heavily on the Congress, accusing them of ""shamelessly"" glorifying Maoists as ""revolutionaries"". Addressing a public rally in Bhilai, Adityanath said: ""Naxalism in Chhattisgarh has spread due to Congress. They have made a breeding ground for the Naxals here. The Congress is shamelessly glorifying the Naxals as revolutionaries. Congress' culture is just to promote loot, Naxalism and corruption."" Accusing the Congress of creating obstacles in the path of development, Adityanath chided the party for ignoring national interests. ""The Congress always creates obstacles in development. They are the biggest obstacle even in the construction of the Ram Temple. Congress is only interested in vote bank politics and have completely ignored national interests,"" Adityanath asserted. The chief minister hailed the Raman Singh-led government in the state, saying that the welfare programmes had benefitted the public who, according to him, were now looking forward to re-elect Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming Assembly elections. Criticising the previous Ajit Jogi-led government, Adityanath said: ""When they were in power, Congress openly promoted corruption. They never made policies for farmers and the poor. Under Raman Singh and Narendra Modi governments, Chhattisgarh has made great strides. It was earlier known as a   state, but Raman Singh has changed the face of Chhattisgarh. Hospitals, educational institutions and stadiums have been built under him, strengthening the infrastructure of the state. Surplus electricity was also achieved due to Raman Singh's efforts. All such things did not happen during the Congress regime."" On Saturday, while addressing a rally in Lormi, Adityanath said that once the Ram Temple is built in his 'maternal state' Chhattisgarh, it will also be constructed in Ayodhya too. Claiming that the BJP has been tirelessly working for the rights and welfare of the poor, he had said, ""For the first time after independence, a prime minister announced that no poor in India will be without a house by 2022. Had there not been a BJP government at the Centre, people in Chhattisgarh wouldn't have got houses which they are receiving now.""

Press Trust of India," A farmer on Sunday attempted suicide by consuming pesticide at a public gathering where Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was present in Pransli village of Gir Somnath district, some 400 kilometres from Ahmedabad, police said. Mashribhai Dodiya was upset with local authorities for failing to remove an encroachment on a panchayat land at the entrance of his farm in Dolasa village in Kodinar taluka of the district, Gir Somnath Superintendent of Police Rahul Tripathi said. ""Someone has illegally captured a panchayat plot outside the agricultural land belonging to the farmer, making it hard for him to enter his own land. Orders had already been issued by the collector to remove the encroachment, but local authorities have not acted upon it,"" the SP added. Dodiya consumed pesticide as soon as Rupani started addressing the public at the village where he earlier inaugurated a new marketing yard, Tripathi said. ""The victim was held by the police deployed at the venue and rushed to a government hospital in Veraval. Doctors have said his condition is stable,"" he said. Dodiya told reporters that the encroachment of the panchayat land, which he claimed was the handiwork of the land mafia, had made it difficult for him to enter his own farm. ""Some land mafia closed the road leading to my farm by encroaching upon a land. I had approached the chief minister, who had ordered that the encroachment be removed, but nothing has happened so far,"" Dodiya said.

Ayswarya Murthy," The Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee has released its list of candidates for the upcoming state Assembly election, several days later than expected due to prolonged discussions on seat-sharing among the coalition partners of the ‘Praja Kootami’ or People’s Coalition. The delay, more often attributed to M Kodandaram, president of the newly-minted political outfit and alliance partner Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS), is perhaps indicative of the role the party could play in potentially upsetting KCR’s return to power; the Congress's Telangana unit certainly thinks so. So far, they have   the deputy chief minister’s post as well as a Rajya Sabha seat if he is flexible on the number of seats for TJS. A former professor at Osmania University, Kodandaram chaired the Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) that spearheaded the movement for statehood, particularly mobilising students and civil society organisations. Fresh from this victory, Telangana is, especially familiar and amenable to the kind of on the ground activism that Kodandaram and the TJAC are adept at. As the political front of TJAC, what the TJS leader offers the congress-led coalition is a grassroots mobilisation by the civil society organisation in exchange for the price of a cultural shift in politics and governance. ""Over the last four years, the civil society groups have emerged as the main opposition to KCR. It is in this context that I am proposing this alternative,"" he said. Kodandaram says that the People's Coalition can't replicate KCR's strategy of ""distributing money and buying caste associations"", rather the focus should be on projecting the alliance as a counter to KCR and mobilising the masses on the basis of a common minimum agenda. “This (KCR's strategy) cannot be replicated (by us) and in fact, it won’t yield results. It is a kind of trap. Rather we (the People's Coalition) must mobilise the people, civil society organisations, youth and caste-based organisations on the basis of the common minimum agenda as decided by the alliance partners,” he says. However, the discussions on working out an election strategy are still going on. “To me it appears that parties are not able to visualise more concretely this alternative (mobilising of the masses) to the traditional campaign model that we propose. In order to be successful, we have to go from house to house. Talk to each person. During the course of the Telangana agitation, we followed this and were quite successful. The general public’s involvement in politics has increased because of this campaign method,” he informed. Considering that many TJS leaders are also activists who have been associated with various social movements over the past three decades, Kodandaram says they have the acceptance and legitimacy that can help bring home victory for the alliance. TJS, which was launched in April this year, was all set to go to polls independently. They wanted to be able to act and think without relying on borrowed support, he says, but the early dissolution of the Assembly disturbed their calendar of activities. While forming an alliance might not have been their first choice, Kodandaram has come to realise that with the decision to form join forces, the mood has completely changed all over the state. “We have seen and it has been proved by various survey reports that the opinion is shifting in favour of the Kootami, against KCR. That is a positive development,” he says. However, despite the urgency, TJS had remained firm on its demand to contest in at least 12 seats out of the 119 going for polls, based on TJS’ strength and capacity. “We have explained, with data, how we can deliver victory in some of the seats that the Congress has never won in the last 35 years, because we are organisationally strong in these constituencies. Over the past few months, the constituency in-charge in as many as 25 seats have been building a network down to the villages, and with alliance support, we can ensure victory here,” he says. The TJS eventually agreed to contest only on eight seats, however, Kodandaram has said   that all these seats are in the constituencies of their choice, and are not those that the Congress wants to hand out. TJS was always going to challenge KCR, a former partner in the fight for Telangana, on the electoral field; but ironically, the Praja Kootami has put TJS on the same side of the table as TDP, which vehemently opposed the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. They may be unlikely bedfellows, but Kodandaram says they have decided to unite to realise an important objective: “Democracy must be restored and the autocratic rule of KCR should come to an end.” Things changed after Telangana was formed, he says, “We, as a civil society organisation, decided to act as a watchdog and the TRS, as a political party, decided to work on their own. Though we were not interested in giving unsolicited suggestions, we expected some kind of access to the decision-making structure. In a democracy, the involvement of people in the decision-making process is essential, but they were not interested.” Kodandaram also says that KCR has an autocratic hold over his partymen and the government; so even ministers were nothing more than rubber stamps and key decisions were not taken in time. The TJAC, he says, was very critical of the government’s large-scale land acquisitions, and lack of a strong employment policy and measures to handle drought. They asked the government for strict implementation of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013. They also insisted that a UPSC-like vacancy system should be adopted by the government for employment, and critiqued the current drought-relief, skill development and education reforms in the newly-formed state. And so, five years after Kodandaram insisted that he had no political ambitions, the college professor found himself entering the arena. The goal is not to change the government, but governance itself, he insists. For TJS, this means making governments more accountable to the people and ensuring participation, he says. “In the agenda, we have suggested a series of measures including strengthening the SC/ST commissions, human rights commissions, Lokayuktha and anti-corruption bureaus. We must allow for people to claim government welfare schemes as a matter of right; not treated as charity. So, we have suggested a civic amenities act with a redressal mechanism built into it,” he informs. And Kodandaram is well aware of how most of the manifestoes are ignored after elections. Which is why, even before seat sharing negotiations, a pre-condition to the alliance was that TJS would have and should have ample control over its implementation.",2018-11-11,"Accountability,Governance,KCR,M Kodandaram,People's Coalition,Praja Kootami,TDP,Telangana,Telangana Election 2018,Telangana Joint Action Committee,Telangana Polls,TheySaidIt","'Changing governance, not govt our goal,' says TJS chief M Kodandaram as party emerges as Congress' key to counter KCR",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/changing-governance-not-govt-our-goal-says-telangana-jana-samiti-chief-m-kodandaram-as-party-emerges-as-key-to-counter-kcr-5531881.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Ahead of the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, phase one of which is scheduled for Monday, Maoists have stepped up violence to ensure that voters boycott these polls. This time, the Maoists seem  , which is evident in their latest attacks in Chhattisgarh, the last of which killed four civilians along with one officer of the Central Industrial Security Force, their intended target. Every election in Chhattisgarh faces an   to prevent or severely disrupt polling. Even this year, Maoists have threatened voters to ""boycott the fake Chhattisgarh elections"", or else risk having their inked fingers chopped off. So feared are these Maoists that even   is a security threat in their strongholds. On Monday, 18 of the 90 Assembly constituencies in eight districts of Chhattisgarh go to the polls in the first phase of the elections. These eight districts located in Maoist hotbeds in south Chhattisgarh are among the worst-affected by Left-Wing Extremism in the country, which is why the polls will be held amid a tight security cover of thousands of police and paramilitary personnel. Twelve of the 18 constituencies are located in Bastar, the biggest Maoist stronghold in Chhattisgarh, and also a Congress bastion. At present, the Congress holds eight of these seats, as against the BJP’s four. Besides  ,  ,  ,   and   are the other places where the first phase of the elections will be held on Monday. In some security-sensitive areas of Dantewada, polling booths have been set up for the first time in 20 years. The other six constituencies that go to the polls are in Rajnandgaon district. Here, even though Chief Minister Raman Singh holds the Rajnandgaon seat, the Congress holds four of the six seats in the district, which is not free from the Maoist threat either. It is clear from the campaigning that the BJP, Congress as well as the alliance comprising Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) are aware that the   holds the key to forming the next government in Chhattisgarh. The   centre around development in this area. While the ruling BJP has claimed that the state is nearly Naxal-free, the reality is very different. Villagers in these areas continue to live in fear, more so now with the battle between the insurgents and the government heightened ahead of the elections. Security agencies have been preparing to ensure peaceful polls. Chhattisgarh Chief Electoral Officer Subrat Sahoo is also confident of successful elections in the state. But the Maoists have also stepped up their efforts to thwart a successful election, having threatened voters with dire consequences. Furthermore, while Maoists have put up hordes of posters to drive home their message, the Election Commission has also plastered hoardings and posters   and encourage people to vote. Sukma and Dantewada have scores of such posters by Maoists, asking people to boycott the polls. In the 2013 polls, several polling booths in these Maoist hotbeds recorded 10 percent votes, with some registering zero votes as well. It remains to be seen whether efforts by the government, Election Commission and the self-help groups brought on board to bring voters out of their homes can help increase the turnout in these regions despite the security threat.",2018-11-11,"Assembly Election 2018,Bastar,Bijapur,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Election,Chhattisgarh Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Election News,Chhattisgarh Elections,Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly Election,Chhattisgarh Maoists,Chhattisgarh News,Chhattisgarh Polls,Chhattisgarh Polls 2018,Dantewada,Election Commission,Maoist Boycott,Maoist Threat,Narayanpur,Sukma",Chhattisgarh elections: Maoist hotbeds go to polls in phase one; officials hopeful of good turnout,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-elections-maoist-hotbeds-bastar-sukma-dantewada-go-to-polls-in-phase-one-officials-hopeful-of-good-turnout-5532611.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," The ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress have gone into damage-control mode to get party rebels to withdraw from the fray in Madhya Pradesh which goes to polls on 28 November. The state has a 230-member Assembly and sources from both parties believe that these rebels could prove to be the decisive factor in 30-odd seats. The last date to withdraw nominations is 14 November. According to a senior BJP leader, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state BJP chief Rakesh Singh, party vice-president Prabhat Jha and state organisational secretary Suhas Bhagat among others were contacting party rebels to get them to opt out of the electoral race.

They said that Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath, former Union minister Jyotriraditya Scindia, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ajay Singh were also involved in ensuring that the party's official candidates don't have to fight the rebels. Digvijay Singh told rebels that the official candidates were chosen after much deliberations by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, and that the rebels should work in the interest of the party. Prominent among the BJP rebels who are in the fray this time are Ramkrishna Kusumari, five-time MP and a powerful leader from the impoverished Bundelkhand region, who has filed his nomination papers from two Assembly seats, Damoh and Patharia, as an Independent candidate.

Press Trust of India,": The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Sunday promised a corruption-free administration, prohibition and a loan waiver for farmers if elected to power in Chhattisgarh. Releasing its manifesto in Raipur for the state polls, which the AAP is contesting for the first time, the Arvind Kejriwal-led party announced a slew of measures for different sections of the society. The Delhi-based party has fielded candidates in all the 90 assembly seats in the BJP-ruled state. The AAP manifesto comes on the eve of the first phase of polling Monday covering 18 assembly seats spread across over half a dozen Maoist-affected districts. The second and final phase of voting, covering the remaining 72 seats, will be held on 20 November. In its 36-point manifesto, the fledgling outfit has promised Rs 2,600 minimum support price (MSP) for each quintal of paddy, a loan waiver for farmers, jobs to youths and a ban on sale of liquor in the state. ""After the AAP government is formed in the state, the priority will be to make it corruption-free and prosperous,"" Delhi Cabinet Minister and Chhattisgarh AAP in-charge Gopal Rai said while releasing the manifesto at a press conference.

""What Ajit Jogi had done when he was (Congress) chief minister for three years (2000-2003) and what the BJP has done during its 15-year long rule?"" the AAP leader asked.

Indo-Asian News Service," In what could be a worrying sign for the Goa BJP, former state RSS chief Subhash Velingkar, an arch rival of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, on Sunday announced his plunge into electoral politics. The announcement comes at a time when the state BJP as well as the BJP-led coalition government in Goa are facing immense flak over the continuance of ailing Parrikar as chief minister. ""I will be actively working for the Goa Suraksha Manch,"" Velingkar told reporters in Panaji. Asked if he would be contesting the upcoming bypolls in Goa's Shiroda and Mandrem constituencies which have been necessitated due to resignations of Congress MLAs from both seats, Velingkar said the decision would be taken at ""the appropriate time"". He also said that considering the political chaos in the state, following Parrikar's illness and comfortable numbers in the Assembly still eluding the BJP, the Goa Assembly would be dissolved and fresh polls would be announced in Goa along with Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Velingkar, 66, has served as the state Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief for more than two decades and is considered responsible for the political grooming of the state BJP's top leaders including Parrikar, Union Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik and former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar. He was sacked from the RSS in 2016 after he took on Parrikar, who Velingkar accused of backstabbing the principles of both the Sangh as well as BJP.

The Election Commission on Friday imposed a near month-long ban on holding exit polls beginning 12 November in the five poll-bound states including Telangana. A notification issued by the poll panel said that between 7 am of 12 November and 5.30 pm of 7 December, ""conducting any exit poll and publishing or publicising the result of exit poll by means of print or electronic media or in any other manner shall be prohibited"". Caretaker Chief Minister and TRS supremo K Chnadrasekhar Rao handed over B-Forms to party's contesting candidates on Sunday after a brainstorming session with them. He is expected to file his nomination from Gajwel constituency in Medak district on 14 November.

Press Trust of India," A staunch RSS ideologue, a hard boiled organisation man, Bengaluru's ""most loved"" MP and the first person to speak in Kannada in the United Nations are some of the connotations associated with Union Minister Ananth Kumar. Known for his political adroitness, Kumar, a six-time member of Parliament, gregarious with strong political instincts, had managed to be in the inner circle of the central leadership of the BJP — be it during the heyday of Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L K Advani and now Narendra Modi. Born in a middle class Brahmin family on July 22, 1959, in Bengaluru to Narayan Shastri, a railway employee, and Girija N Shastry, his early education began under the guidance of his mother who herself was a graduate. Graduate in Arts and Law, Kumar's journey into public life began due to his association with the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organisation of the Sangh Pariwar, which he served in various capacities, including the state secretary and the national secretary. Kumar had even demonstrated against the then Indira Gandhi government's imposition of Emergency and had also got imprisoned for it for about 30 days. With his steady political growth, his association with the Sangh, where he was mentored politically, also grew stronger. Looking for bigger ground in politics, Kumar joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1987, where he went on to to take up the responsibilities of state secretary, state president of the Yuva Morcha, general secretary and national secretary. Along with the then state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa, Kumar is among a few party leaders who can be credited for the growth of BJP in Karnataka, as they built the party from the scratch, which paved the way for the installation of the first ever saffron party government in the South. Kumar began his parliamentary career when he got elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Bangalore South, the constituency which remained his strong fort till his passing sway, by winning it for six consecutive times. He enjoyed the credit of being the ""youngest"" minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet in 1998. He served as the Civil Aviation minister, also Minister for Tourism, Sports, Youth Affairs & Culture, Urban development & poverty alleviation. Kumar, who also held positions in various parliamentary committees, was serving as the Union Cabinet Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals and Fertilizers in the Narendra Modi led government, after winning the 15th Lok Sabha election from Bengaluru south by defeating IT Czar Nandan Nilekani. He is widely credited for implementing Neem Coated Urea and setting up of Jan Aushadhi Kendras with focus on affordable quality health care. While being the all important member of the BJP's parliamentary board, Kumar is often regarded as the ""Delhi face"" of the Karnataka BJP and also for the state government who could be counted upon for taking issues concerning Karnataka. He is known to have had politically hostile relationship with Yeddyurappa on occasions and often faced accusations of meddling too much in Karnataka affairs, when the the Lingayat strongman was at the helm of affairs in the state as its Chief Minister. Kumar is married to Dr Tejaswini and they have two daughters Aishwarya and Vijetha. Kumar is the Chief Patron of Adamya Chetana, an NGO involved in social work which he runs along with his wife in the memory of his mother Girija Shastry.",2018-11-12,"Ananth Kumar,Ananth Kumar Passes Away,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Bengaluru,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP Leader,BS Yeddyurappa,Karnataka,Karnataka BJP,Lal Krishna Advani,Narendra Modi,RSS,Union Minister,Union Minister Ananth Kumar,Union Minister Of Parliamentary Affairs","Ananth Kumar dies at 59: Staunch RSS ideologue was member of BJP's inner circle through Vajpayee, Advani and Modi eras",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ananth-kumar-dies-at-59-staunch-rss-ideologue-was-member-of-bjps-inner-circle-through-vajpayee-advani-and-narendra-modi-eras-5534421.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ajaz Ashraf,"The cynicism of the Congress in framing the election manifesto for Madhya Pradesh will have stung the ideological opponents of Hindutva. They are likely to wonder whether a Congress victory in that state will decisively shift India's polity to the Right and make majoritarianism its common sense. They will even calculate whether the price to be paid for a Congress revival is worth it. The manifesto of India's Grand Old Party is indeed an eloquent testament to the abysmal depths to which it can plunge. Emulating the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress has promised to develop the Ram Path Gaman or the route Lord Ram is said to have taken during the 11 years of 14 in exile he purportedly spent in Madhya Pradesh's forests. In addition, there are sops a plenty to appeasing the Hindu clergy. The Congress has also doffed its Gandhian   to the BJP's politics of cow. If voted to power, the Congress will begin commercial production of cow urine, build a   in every  , allocate a separate fund for them, establish temporary camps to treat injured bovines and perform their last rites if required. Quite alarmingly, its idea of land reform has degenerated into making additional land available for cattle to graze. These promises in the Congress manifesto for Madhya Pradesh should belie the expectations of all those who had hoped that it would provide an alternative frame to the BJP's idea of Hinduism: That it would create its own archetype Hindu to compete with the BJP’s intolerant, militant version. These expectations were stoked because of Congress president Rahul Gandhi flaunting his Hinduness and visiting temples to convey that he and his party were not anti-Hindu as the BJP alleged. His emphasis on his Hindu identity was thought to herald the beginning of a concerted fight for reclaiming the philosophical and cultural heritage of Hinduism, to at least deny the BJP the sole monopoly of the Hindu religious realm. The Congress manifesto for Madhya Pradesh shows that it has neither the intellectual heft nor the energy and patience for such a task. It has, therefore, chosen the easier option of imitating Hindutva, not re-inventing or reinterpreting Hinduism. Its choice of the state to showcase its imitation Hindutva, aka soft Hindutva, is remarkable for its cynicism. With Muslims constituting just 6.57 percent of the state's population, their possible alienation has barely any electoral significance for the Congress. The Congress has also made the tacit assumption that Muslims will not vote for the BJP. After all, the Sangh Parivar has relentlessly targeted them to consolidate its Hindu vote bank. The Congress thinks Muslims will choose its soft Hindutva over the BJP's hard Hindutva because they have no third option. These are classic blackmail tactics: Pay up (read: Vote for us) or keep getting clobbered over the next five years. In case a section of Muslims stay at home or press NOTA, the consequent loss of votes can be more than offset by gaining those of Hindus who might be tempted to back the Congress for pandering to their religious sentiments. On such cold calculations is the Congress' Hindutva adventurism in Madhya Pradesh based. This adventurism has been encouraged also because the Congress is insulated from the possibility of its Madhya Pradesh manifesto marring its prospects in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan — the other two states that will vote over the next 26 days. This is because Muslims comprise just 7.17 percent in Chhattisgarh; its polity, like Madhya Pradesh’s, too is largely bipolar even though a Third Front in the form of an alliance between former chief minister Ajit Jogi and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati exists there. Shrewdly, the Congress made public its manifesto just 48 hours before the first round of polling in Chhattisgarh was to commence. Large-scale shifts in voting, as any psephologist will vouch for, rarely happen overnight. In Rajasthan, Muslims comprise a healthy 9.7 percent of the state's population. That could prove decisive in a close race. But Rajasthan, too, has bipolar politics and doesn’t even have a third front matching in strength, on paper at least, the one in Chhattisgarh. Most media reports and opinion surveys show that the political wind is strongly blowing against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan. Muslims can’t buck the trend, can they, regardless of the Congress manifesto enraging them? Will their rage sustain until 7 December, which is when Rajasthan will vote? The answers in both cases: Very unlikely. The Congress can also play the majoritarian game because its calculation is that it does not have much to lose in the long term. Muslims have shifted their allegiance to regional outfits in states where they are numerous. Think Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Delhi, and large parts of Assam. The Hindutva challenge to the Congress is confined to the Hindi heartland, not south India, where in Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu an electoral alliance has already emerged. It will likely also emerge in Andhra Pradesh. Whatever their angst over Congress policies and the ideological shift, Muslims will not vote in these states for a regional party embedded in a BJP-led alliance. In Kerala, religious minorities have the option to side with the Left Front, which, obviously, will not support the BJP at the Centre. For one, it is predetermined that the Congress will spearhead the Opposition alliance for next year's General Election. The outlook of such an alliance will be refracted through the soft Hindutva prism of the Congress. For the other, the Congress manifesto legitimises Hindutva and the politics of cow. That should immensely worry the secular-liberal brigade rooting for the Congress. This is because India's past electoral history shows that the BJP's Hindu card acquired credibility and salience only when Indira Gandhi decided to play it from the 1970s. The split in the Congress in 1969 had deprived her of an organisational network. She sought to overcome this problem through populist policies like   and abolition of the privy purse. Once the electoral benefits from these policies diminished, she turned to courting the Hindus as Hindu. About her rule, the late journalist Balraj Puri wrote: ""Her frequent visit to Hindu shrines and religious personalities gave her a religious image. But what really endeared her to Hindu militants was her militant nationalism which she first introduced in Indian politics in the 1970s and which she tended to fill in the ideological vacuum to which the Indira-JP [Jayaprakash Narayan] confrontation had significantly contributed as none of the sides was ideologically based."" Her problems were further compounded with the drifting away of Muslims in the post-Emergency 1977 Lok Sabha election. The rise of militancy in Punjab and Kashmir provided her the opportunity to unabashedly engage in othering the Sikhs and Kashmiri Muslims. For instance, following Operation Blue Star, Gandhi at a speech in Garhwal declared that Hindu   was under attack and appealed to save Hindu culture from Sikh and Muslim attack. Then again, in 1983, she wooed the Hindus in the Jammu and Kashmir election campaign by stoking the fears regarding the Resettlement Bill that allowed Kashmiris who had migrated to Pakistan between 1947 and 1954 to return and reclaim their properties. The Congress swept the Jammu province as the BJP did in December 2014 through its own brand of polarisation. The process of Hinduisation of Indian politics sped up thereafter. In a flagrant violation of the secular principle, Rajiv Gandhi overturned the Supreme Court’s 1985 Shah Bano judgement through a law. He then sought to neutralise the Hindu backlash against it by getting the locks on the gates of the Babri Masjid removed in 1986. From thereon, the BJP’s graph started to rise and that of the Congress began to dip. The Congress of Indira and Rajiv pursued soft Hindutva and found the BJP overtake it through its more militant version in later years. It is now the Congress that is trying to play catch-up with the BJP. It is always perilous to forecast whether people will choose imitation Hindutva over its 24-carat version. Given that the conviction of Congress changes in accordance with its electoral performance, a victory in Madhya Pradesh will decisively push India's polity to the Right. Conversely, a defeat there will have it revise its strategy of meeting the BJP’s challenge through soft Hindutva. That would certainly keep alive the idea of India, about which Rahul Gandhi tires of talking.",2018-11-12,"BJP,Congress,Congress Manifesto,Hindutva,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,PoliticalPlay,Rahul Gandhi,Soft HIndutva",Madhya Pradesh polls 2018: Congress' cynical manifesto for state threatens to push India's polity farther Right,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-polls-2018-congress-cynical-manifesto-for-state-threatens-to-push-indias-polity-farther-right-5534391.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"The Congress has embarked upon a perilous path on its way to a sort of possible way to power in Bhopal. Election surveys have not as yet indicated that the Congress will be able to ride anti-incumbency sentiments accumulated over 15 years to seize the reins of government in Madhya Pradesh, even though the possibility is not being counted as being remote either. To be able to do so, the Congress needed to get some simple things right. It failed. Now, unfortunately, it has plumped for some of the more complex things and it's getting them wrong. Let's begin with the main thing it failed to do right — alliances. The party had intended to finalise pre-election alliances principally with Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), but also with the Samajwadi Party and the Gondwana Ganatantra Party (GGP). It failed on all fronts. After some listless negotiations, Mayawati decided to go solo, while the Samajwadi Party and GGP settled on an alliance excluding the Congress, accusing it of being too dilatory. All the Congress managed was a largely inconsequential tie-up with the Sharad Yadav wing of the Janata Dal (United) — the Loktantrik Janata Dal — for which it has set aside one seat. An alliance with the BSP alone would have exponentially increased the Congress' chances of unseating three-time BJP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Having failed, mostly because the party still seems sometimes to live in earlier climes when the problems of making the necessary accommodations was barely felt, the Congress seems to be trying to compensate by casting its net for votes through an overly inclusive manifesto. Thus, it has combined in what it is calling its   rather than   — a promissory document rather than a list of announcements — elements possibly expected to pander to the majority community and the more usual mix of 'secular', material 'promises'. Let's take the second constellation of promises first. The Congress has promised to cut farmers' electricity bills by half as also reduce LPG, petrol and diesel prices. It has also promised to waive agricultural loans taken from all types of state-run cooperative banks. Thus far, the Congress has kept in mind the needs of agriculturists and their widespread disenchantment with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments at the Centre and in the state. To address the issue of unemployment and the Centre's inability to create jobs anywhere near the magnitude promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 election campaign and thereafter, the Congress has promised an unemployment benefit of Rs 10,000 a month for one young member of every relevant family for a period of three years. It has promised, for good measure, an   payment of Rs 51,000 for women at the time of their marriage and of Rs 2,50,000 to the landless for the construction of a house on a plot of 450 square feet. It has also promised the abolition of the infamous Vyapam — or Vyavasayik Pariksha Mandal, the autonomous agency set up by the Chouhan government to conduct professional examinations, which is embroiled in serious irregularities and has so far claimed, directly or indirectly, an unconsciously high number of lives. The death continues to mount and is near the half-a-century mark. Until this point, the Congress seems to have addressed very real concerns arising from the mismanagement of the economy by the Modi government and the special needs of some social groups. But then the party and its promissory document goes off script. They promise the construction of   (cow shelters), a bizarre ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ tour to trace Rama’s footprints in Madhya Pradesh and, in an inescapably dangerous move, the setting up of a ‘religious and spiritual department’ that will organise the production of cow urine and cow-dung cakes in  . Let's navigate our way through this set of promises. The promise that the government/state will involve itself in setting up cow shelters is from one point of view unexceptionable, though why other domesticated animals should miss out on this love for animals is an unanswerable question in terms of strictly humane motivations. Obviously, of course, this is meant not to be a concession to concerns of animal-rights activists. It is meant to harness the electoral energy of the cow-protection movement popularised by Sangh Parivar elements and sparked off by the spate of draconian legislative amendments passed by newly-minted BJP state governments since 2014. Given the dangerous overtones of this movements — its descent into vigilantism that has claimed the lives of many Muslims — the Congress' pandering to perceived electoral compulsions is downright dangerous. Moreover, this movement is owned by the Sangh Parivar and a   is unlikely to drive BJP voters into the arms of the Congress. On the contrary, the Congress could have consolidated the support of the Dalit and Muslim communities who have seen their cultural, livelihood and nutritional choices come under attack by promising a return to the more liberal pre-Modi cow-protection regime. The attempt to have the government trace the footprints of a mythological figure in an institutionalised manner is much too bizarre to contemplate. It is also unlikely to provide much electoral fodder to the party. The best that can be said of this brainwave (or brain fade) is that it might provide a spur to the tourism industry. The other initiative is fundamentally dangerous. It would be fairly innocuous if private cow shelters decided to collect (or produce, whatever that means) cow urine and make cow-dung pats to sell in the market and generate revenue. Both are useful products: One chiefly as an organic fertiliser, the other as a widely used and cheap (though polluting) fuel. But it is not clear why the government should involve itself in such enterprises. It is all the more inexplicable why the Congress government should promise to set up a government department to organise this involvement. But, most damningly, it is inconceivable that the Congress would stray into Hindutva terrain so explicitly as to set up a ‘religious and spiritual department’ because it infringes fundamentally the constitutional mandate for the state to be secular. This was not a provision presented to the Congress as a   by the Constituent Assembly, rather the ‘secular’ part of the definition of the Indian republic was added by amendment to the Preamble in 1976 by the Indira Gandhi government. For the Congress to now compromise so grievously on a constitutional fundamental which it has professed to hold dear for nearly half a century is unthinkable, inexplicable, egregious and wholly unacceptable, whatever the electoral compulsions it faces. This is especially true because it loses no opportunity to assail the BJP for its attacks on the constitutionally-mandated secular fabric of the nation.",2018-11-12,"Congress,Cow Urine,Gaushala,InMyOpinion,Lord Ram,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Polls,Manifesto,Secularism",Congress' Madhya Pradesh manifesto is an egregious violation of party's position on nation's secular fabric,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-madhya-pradesh-manifesto-is-an-egregious-violation-of-partys-position-on-nations-secular-fabric-5535611.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"Voters in 18 of the 90 constituencies of Chhattisgarh are gearing up to cast their ballots in the first phase of the Assembly elections on Monday. These seats are spread across eight Maoist-affected districts of the state. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has  , is looking to win its fourth term, but lack of development, Maoist “infestation”, unemployment and non-fulfillment of poll promises have fuelled sentiments of anti-incumbency. These give the Congress an edge in these polls, especially in the first phase as it already holds 12 of the 18 seats that go to the polls. However, these elections are a triangular contest, as the alliance between former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi’s Janata Congress Chhattisgarh, Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party and the Communist Party of India adds another dimension to the state politics. In his Rajnandgaon constituency, Singh is fighting the polls against Congress candidate Karuna Shukla, the niece of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In Narayanpur, the Congress has renominated Chandan Kashyap against BJP minister Kedar Kahsyap. Chandan had lost to Kedar in 2013. The Congress has also given a second chance to Vikram Mandavi from the Bijapur (ST) seat against state Forest Minister Mahesh Gagda. Mandavi had lost to Gagda in the last polls. Prominent BJP leader and Kanker Lok Sabha MP Vikram Usendi is contesting from Antagarh (ST), where the Congress has fielded a fresh face, Anoop Nag. Usendi had won the Antagarh seat in the 2013 polls, but he resigned after he was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2014. The ruling BJP has also fielded two sitting MLAs — Santosh Bafna (Jagdalpur) and Sarojani Banjar (Dongargarh) — whereas the Congress has renominated its nine sitting legislators — Manoj Singh Mandavi (Bhanupratappur), Mohan Lal Markam (Kondagaon), Lakheshwar Baghel (Bastar), Deepak Kumar Baij (Chitrakot), Devati Karma (Dantewada), Kawasi Lakhma (Konta), Girwar Janghel (Khairagarh), Santram Netam (Keshkal) and Daleshwar Sahu (Dongargaon). Devati Karma, wife of Congress leader Mahendra Karma who was killed in the  , had defeated the BJP's Bhima Mandavi, but the BJP fielded Mandavi from the Dantewada seat again. The saffron party has also nominated Dhani Ram Barse, who had lost to senior Congress leader Kawasi Lakhma from the Konta seat. Chief Minister Raman Singh, two Chhattisgarh cabinet ministers and an incumbent BJP MP are among the  , of which 12 are reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) and one for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. These include: - Khairagarh

The campaigning for the polls, which ended on Saturday, saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath raising the pitch for the saffron party on one side, and Congress chief Rahul Gandhi attacking the BJP over corruption, agrarian distress and unemployment in Chhattisgarh on the other. Over   for the polls, BJP leaders tried to assert that the state was nearly Maoist-free, even as the ultras launched attacks on security personnel in Dantewada. Party leaders claimed Naxalism had been contained in the 15 years under the BJP and that the government had undertaken several development works. The Congress, on the other hand, accused the BJP of ""failing"" to control the Maoist menace in Chhattisgarh and also brought up chit fund and civil supply scams  . As many as 4,336 polling booths have been set up for the first phase of the Chhattisgarh polls, in which an electorate of 31,79,520 voters can cast their ballots. This includes 16,21,839 men, 15,57,592 women and 89 of the third gender. Polling in the Naxal-hit constituencies of Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta will be held from 7 am to 3 pm. In the other seats — Khairgarh, Dongargarh, Rajnandgaon, Dongargaon, Khujji, Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot — voting will be held from 8 am to 5 pm. Nearly one lakh security personnel, including paramilitary forces, have been   heading to the polls in Chhattisgarh for the first phase. These are in addition to the existing paramilitary personnel and 200 companies of state forces engaged in anti-Maoist operations in the tribal-dominated state. Chhattisgarh Special Director General (Anti-Maoist operations) DM Awasthi said the Centre has deployed 650 companies (around 65,000 security personnel), including of paramilitary forces like the Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police and other state forces, to Chhattisgarh for poll duty in the first phase. Helicopters of the Indian Air Force and BSF have also been pressed into service. For the police, escorting polling parties to their destinations and bringing them back after voting closes will be their biggest challenge in the Maoist hotbeds. Awasthi said around 650 polling booth parties had been airlifted by helicopters to remote areas on Saturday, while the other teams were sent by road on Sunday. The second phase of the Chhattisgarh elections will be held on 20 November, and the votes will be counted on 11 December, along with those polled in the Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan elections.

Press Trust of India," A Congress leader on Friday termed the Shiv Sena's comments, that people were ""waiting to punish"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing demonetisation two years ago, as ""interesting and fairly accurate"". All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge of Maharashtra, Ashish Dua, however, also said it remains to be seen if the Shiv Sena would still be part of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and the state despite its constant criticism of its senior ally. Shiv Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande had on Thursday slammed the 2016 note ban decision of the Centre and claimed ""the situation after two years has become so bad that people are waiting to punish the prime minister"". On 8 November, 2016, Modi had announced scrapping of then in use Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denomination bank notes with immediate effect. ""Interesting...Statement & observation by long term ally of #BJP over #DemonetisationDisaster is fairly accurate...Now, whether .#ShivSena will sail the same boat to be downed in #Maharashtra or chart a different course is yet to be seen... Time will tell!"" Dua tweeted. The Sena spokesperson had also claimed the note ban exercise was a ""complete failure"" as none of its objectives was achieved. ""While the (Union) Finance Minister says more number of people have been brought under the tax net, he has failed to explain the rationale behind it (demonetisation) as several lakh people lost jobs,"" Kayande had said Thursday. However, the BJP strongly defended the note ban exercise. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had Thursday said demonetisation has strengthened the economy and increased the government resources to fund poverty alleviation and infrastructure development programme. ""What has happened to prophets of doom who said India's GDP will decline by at least 2 percent?

FP Staff,"Insurgency-hit Chhattisgarh is one of the five states where Assembly elections will be held in November-December. As the state gears up for the two-phase polls on 12 and 20 November, tensions have been on the rise, with Maoists issuing warnings against voting, election booths being set up in villages for the first time in 20 years, and alliances between formed between regional and national parties. The   in Chhattisgarh is likely to escalate ahead of the polls, with both sides dialing up the pressure in terms of the strength of the forces and cadre, as well as arms and ammunition. In Naxal strongholds such as Bastar and Dantewada, security personnel, including jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have been deployed aplenty. The government and police are expected to be on the highest alert in the run-up to the elections as insurgents have threatened to disrupt voting. Despite precaution,   and a convoy of police personnel on 30 October resulted in the death of the   cameraperson, Achutyanand Sahu, and three policemen. They were attacked around Nilwaya village in the Aranpur area of Dantewada district. Another attack was also reported in  , where five people, including two Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, were killed. However,  , the Communist Party of India (Maoist) expressed regret for Sahu's death and said ""journalists were not enemies, but friends"". Sainath of the CPI (Maoist)'s Darbha Divisional Committee said: ""...There are daily attacks on villages; villagers are killed in fake encounters; they are slapped with fake cases, and fake surrenders are orchestrated. In this environment, work began on 1 October to build a road connecting Aranpur to Burgum. To protest this development, we ambushed a police unit on 30 October."" The Dantewada incident not only highlights the significance of the elections being held at Maoist hotbeds, but is also a chilling reminder of the Darbha Valley massacre in 2013, in which much of the Chhattisgarh Congress' top leadership of the time was wiped out. At least 27 people were killed in the  , only a few months before the Assembly elections at the time. In a planned operation, the insurgents had ambushed and killed several Chhattisgarh Congress leaders, including state secretary Nand Kumar Patel, his son Dinesh, former Union minister VC Shukla and former state minister Mahendra Karma. The Congress leaders were on their way from Sukma to Jagdalpur after a rally, which was part of the party's ' , when the attack took place. They had passed through insurgency-affected areas during the march. Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, who was a Congress leader at the time, had also been scheduled to travel with the convoy, but had changed his plan at the last minute and decided to travel by helicopter. The attack is believed to have been carried out with the signature simplicity Maoists used in past strikes. The militants used the thick forested area of the Bastar-Sukma border to their benefit and laid an ambush. After ambushing the convoy, they detonated an IED to create a crater and cut off the convoy's escape route. Once the vehicles slowed down, the Naxals opened indiscriminate fire on the Congress leaders. Mahendra Karma had been on the Maoist hit-list ever since he led the controversial anti-Naxal operation ""Salwa Judum"" in Chhattisgarh. An   report from 2013 said: ""Evidence indicates that rather than an attack to eliminate top Congress leaders, the Maoists' target was only two — Pradesh Congress Committee chief Nand Kumar Patel and Salwa Judum architect Mahendra Karma. All the others probably died in the crossfire, as Maoists later let the survivors go. They even gave water to some, including Konta MLA Kawasi Lakhma, and administered a painkiller injection to Congress leader Dr Shivnarain Dwivedi."" Patel and his son were reported missing, and their bullet-ridden bodies were found in the forest area the next day. Shukla is believed to have succumbed to his injuries on 11 June, 2013. A report in   described how the militants had celebrated Karma's death. Karma had surrendered to the insurgents after his security personnel ran out of ammunition. The report quoted Sattar Ali, a Congress leader from Konta in Sukma, as saying: ""We were terrified and shocked to see the Maoists singing and dancing after killing Karma. They also trampled over his bullet-riddled body."" ""Karma raised his arms, surrendered before the Maoists and appealed to them not to kill any Congress workers. They dragged him a few metres and indiscriminately pumped bullets into him,"" he added. Soon after the incident,   reported that the Madhya Pradesh BJP had accused Jogi ""as the one who had a hand in the 'conspiracy'"" of the Darbha Valley attack. Narendra Singh Tomar, the then Madhya Pradesh BJP president, made the accusation on 31 May, 2013. Even current Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was among the BJP leaders who had supported Tomar's allegation. The report quoted BJP leader Rakesh Singh as highlighting that ""Jogi always said Maoism was a 'social movement' to scuttle all internal security operations"" and demanding an investigation into his role ""in this conspiracy"". In May, Congress president Rahul Gandhi visited Chhattisgarh on the anniversary of the Darbha Valley attack. He  : ""Five years ago, on this day, I lost my friend Nand Kumar Patel in a frightening Naxal attack in Chhattisgarh. Senior leaders VC Shukla ji, Mahendra Karma Ji and many others, lost their lives and were injured... All these patriots gave their lives for the country. We salute their valour and courage.""

Press Trust of India,"The war of words between the BJP and the Congress has intensified ahead of the 28 November polling in Madhya Pradesh with both parties raising a range of issues to attack each other. While the Congress accused the BJP of raking up the issues of Pakistan and Ram temple to ward off an impending electoral defeat, the ruling party said the main opposition outfit is feeling like a ""fish out of water"" since it lost power in Madhya Pradesh 15 years ago. Talking to reporters in Indore on Friday, Congress national spokesperson Shakeel Ahmad said the BJP starts taking the name of Pakistan whenever it senses defeat in elections. It also starts doing politics in the name of Lord Rama when elections are just around the corner, he said. Asked about the Congress' stand on the Ram temple issue, he said, ""This matter is being heard at the Supreme Court. We will surely react if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes any statement about the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya."" The Congress leader said, ""If the BJP government at the Centre wants to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya then why is it not bringing an ordinance? This government is only trying to deceive people in the name of Lord Rama."" Ahmad said India's key defence needs were ignored in the controversial Rafale deal. Meanwhile, Union minister for minority affairs and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi hit out at the Congress. Talking to journalists in Mandsaur while accompanying local BJP candidate Yashpal Singh Sisodiya for filing his nomination papers, Naqvi said the Congress feels restless when out of power and flutters like a ""fish out of water"". Accusing the Congress of engaging in corruption and running governments in a dictatorial manner, Naqvi said the Rahul Gandhi-led party is spreading canards about Prime Minister Narendra and Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Taking potshots at Congress and opposition leaders, Naqvi said there are two dozen candidates for the posts of prime minister and Madhya Pradesh chief minister, but there is no vacancy for these top positions. Union minister and BJP leader Suresh Prabhu said the Congress is running out of ideas in elections and hence it is doing politics on the country's security. He accompanied local BJP candidate Devendra Verma in Khandwa in a rally to file his nomination papers. Prabhu said Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given answers of all questions related to the Rafale fighter jet deal. There should be no politics on the issue of country's defence and security, Prabhu said. All the BJP candidates contesting from assembly seats in Bhopal district reached the returning officer's office in a rally to file their nomination papers.

Press Trust of India," The Congress's manifesto for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls, pledging a ban on holding RSS shakhas on government premises and stopping government staffers from attending those has raised the hackles of the ruling BJP in the poll-bound state. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra, vice-president Prabhat Jha and Madhya Pradesh unit chief Rakesh Singh hit out at the Congress Sunday, accusing it of being opposed to Lord Ram. The Congress manifesto also talks about withdrawing a relaxation given to state government staffers to attend shakhas (class) conducted by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""The Congress believes in   (won't allow the temple, won't allow shakhas). These are the very people who had earlier said that Lord Ram did not exist, that he was a mythical character. That's why they were opposed to the construction of the Ram temple,"" Patra told reporters in a hurriedly-convened press meet here. ""Kapil Sibal (senior Congress leader and lawyer) had objected to the hearing of the Ram temple issue in the Supreme Court before 2019. The Congress's ideology appears to be  ...This is a consistent effort by (Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party to demean the efforts of the RSS,"" he claimed. Hitting out at former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, Patra said, ""Digvijay Singh has also said that the RSS should be banned. He had referred to terrorist Osama bin Laden as Osamaji and also called Zakir Naik, on the run now, an apostle of peace."" Naik is a controversial Islamic preacher who has been living abroad to evade arrest in various cases related to hate speeches and money laundering in India. ""And post 26/11 (Mumbai terror attack), he (Digvijay) had said 26/11 was the RSS's conspiracy and tried to give a clean chit to Pakistan. The same Digvijay Singh calls for a ban on the RSS today,"" Patra said. ""This is nothing but the politics of appeasement followed by the Congress. It reminds us of the days of Emergency of (former prime minister) Indira Gandhi,"" he added. ""For Rahul Gandhi and the Congress, urban Naxals are the best-performing NGOs of India, while the RSS, which is known across the globe for its humanitarian approach, is being defamed,"" Patra said. Jha told reporters in Mandsaur district of Madhya Pradesh that former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had banned the RSS, but their moves had boomeranged. ""Rather, the RSS then grew stronger and expanded manifold. No one can stop the RSS as it is a cultural organisation. It is the biggest cultural organisation in the world. The threat of the Congress against the RSS will boomerang and sink the party,"" he later told reporters. Singh too lashed out at the Congress, saying the opposition party's remarks against the RSS signalled its ""beginning of the end"". ""I challenge the Congress to impose a ban on the RSS if it has the strength,"" he said. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi said, ""The RSS, while it calls itself a cultural organisation, is busy pushing and aggressively promoting a political ideology and a political party."" In Indore, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram described the RSS as a political organisation and defended the Congress manifesto. ""They can deny it to whatever extent but the truth is that the Sangh is a political organisation. This organisation has a political agenda,"" he told reporters. ""After coming to power in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress will fulfil its election promise by banning the government staffers' tendency to participate in RSS shakhas,"" the former Union minister told reporters. ""The people of the state will welcome it, because government staffers should not get connected to a political organisation,"" he said.

Shah, releasing the manifesto entitled 'Sankalp Patra', said the revolution in the state included providing gas connections, electricity, education, employment to the poor and deprived sections of society. ""Taking on the Congress' propaganda and working tirelessly for the state's development for the last 15 years is a big challenge. I am confident that the BJP will win a straight fourth term in office,"" he added. Shah also lauded the Raman Singh government for ""breaking all records of development"" in the last three turns. ""The Congress ruled the country for 55 years, but it is the BJP which is working hard to ensure that the fruits of development reach the last person in the society. The manifesto for the fourth term in office has been prepared by consulting all sections of the society. I assure you that all the promises made will be honoured. Whatever Raman Singh had promised in his earlier manifestos, he has implemented. The BJP, in its fourth term, will be committed to working for the state's development,"" he said. Addressing a press conference in Raipur after releasing the manifesto, Shah said, ""The BJP government under Chief Minister Raman Singh has contained Naxalism and made the state almost free of it."" ""A party that feels Naxalism is a medium for revolution cannot do any good for Chhattisgarh,"" he said, in a subtle dig at the Congress. Shah was apparently referring to Uttar Pradesh Congress president Raj Babbar's remarks last week, when the latter had reportedly said Naxals had launched a ""revolution"" that could not be stopped through guns and the menace should be resolved through talks. State agriculture minister Brijmohan Agrawal,  who heads the BJP’s manifesto drafting committee, had on Friday called the manifesto a ""game changer,"" and said that it will put forth the vision for a new Chhattisgarh, which will be among the most developed states of the country by 2025."" Though he had declined to share details of the manifesto, he said it would focus on farmers and youth and has been drafted with guidance from the party’s central leadership, including Shah. ""In the last one decade or so, the state has emerged as the rice bowl of the country and farmers’ incomes have jumped manifold. Our aim is that this should continue in the future as well,"" he said. Questioned on the delay in releasing the manifesto, Agrawal said the party reached out to the people with various teams travelling to different parts of the state to seek suggestions. It is the BJP’s document of its commitments to the people, he said. In the last 15 years of the BJP government, the party has set up an ecosystem in the state, where social justice and development are complementary to each other, he said.

Press Trust of India," Claiming that the RLSP has gained significantly in strength in Bihar, Union minister Upendra Kushwaha on Friday demanded that his party be allotted more than three seats in the state by the NDA to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats, of which Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party had contested and won three seats in the 2014 general election. ""My party had contested three Lok Sabha seats in 2014 but now this party's strength and base have increased... Our party should be given more than three seats after making a neutral assessment of its strength,"" Mr Kushwaha told reporters at his party office in Patna. Kushwaha, the Union minister of state for human resource development, said there is little doubt the RLSP has gained strength but how much could be a matter of debate. Replying to a query, Kushwaha admitted that he had raised the demand for more number of seats with BJP general secretary and Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav. If need be, he added, he would also speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. Kushwaha said the seat-sharing issue between NDA partners in Bihar - BJP, JD(U), RLSP and LJP - has not been finalised, or else it would have been announced. The BJP had won 22 seats in Bihar in the 2014 election, while Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP had contested seven seats and won six. On 26 October, BJP chief Amit Shah had announced that the BJP and the JD(U) would contest an equal number of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Bihar. Kushwaha asserted his alliance with the BJP and LJP was intact but expressed displeasure over Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar's statement apparently directed at him. He said Kumar should retract the statement or explain what he actually meant. On the seat-sharing issue with particular reference to Kushwaha's RLSP, Kumar had told a television channel on 3 November, ""Do not take the debate to such a low level"". Kushwaha said he felt the remark was laden with casteist overtones. ""I am extremely hurt and pained by Nitish Kumar's statement in which he referred to me as ' '. The kind of language Kumar has used for me is intolerable. Nitish Kumar should withdraw his statement,"" Kushwaha said.

Srinivasa Prasad,"When Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (better known as KCR)   of the state Assembly on 6 September, he was gung-ho with supreme confidence that he would win the election that would follow. This cocksureness was, of course, what had prompted the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader to go in for an early election, which would otherwise have been held along with the Lok Sabha polls a few months later. But two months after KCR took that gamble and about a month before polling, much of his cheeky confidence seems to have evaporated. Even his supporters are beginning to wonder if he is still the unrivalled hero of Telangana, the state carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 after an agitation he spearheaded. His public bluster of winning 100 or more of the Assembly’s 119 seats in the election next month continues, but his impressive oratory in Telugu and Urdu fails to hide his nervous gloom. That’s because he hadn’t expected two things to happen when he opted for the Assembly’s dissolution. One, he didn’t expect the election date to be as late as 7 December. Two, he also didn’t expect what looks like a   – a grand alliance – consisting of Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Jana Sena and CPI to shape up so quickly against him. The gap of 90 days between his announcement and the polling is depriving Rao of the advantages he imagined he would reap by springing a nasty surprise on his rivals. When he had made the announcement, it stunned the Opposition, though his gamble had been in the air for some time. Adding to that shocker was his immediate announcement of the names of candidates for 105 constituencies. But surprises have a habit of ceasing to be surprises after a point, especially in politics. As former British prime minister Harold Wilson once remarked, a week is a long time in politics. Three months is eternity. The TRS leader may have liked the polling to be held earlier, perhaps in early November. The delay also left scope for dissidence to crop up in the TRS in many constituencies. It also not only gave the Opposition enough time to sew up the  , but even gave his rivals the luxury of making a leisurely assessment of TRS candidates before deciding on suitable candidates of their own. Despite his public braggadocio,   is giving KCR sleepless nights. His sense of gloom for the future can be best understood from election statistics of the past. Contrary to popular perception, the TRS didn’t win a massive mandate in 2014, even when the public support for him was supposedly at a peak as part of the euphoria over Telangana’s formation. With a vote share of 34 percent, the party barely scraped through to cross the halfway mark with 63 seats. While the Congress scored 25 percent votes and 21 seats, TDP came third with 14.5 percent votes and 15 seats. Though TRS poached 13 MLAs of the TDP and seven of the Congress later, what is driving KCR up the wall now is that the two parties, which together polled 39.5 percent votes — or 5.5 percent more than the TRS in the last election—are now part of an alliance. The CPI, with 0.9 per cent vote and one seat last time, and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS), a popular splinter group of those who agitated for a separate state, are also part of this alliance, giving it a little more electoral muscle. Election outcomes can’t be predicted with simple additions and subtractions, but KCR is more than wary of the talents of TDP leader and Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu for turning an arithmetic advantage into an electoral windfall for the alliance. The only things that TRS is heavily banking upon are the impressive array of populist schemes that the chief minister rained on the people of the new state, targeting almost every demographic group, in the last four years. As the TRS boast goes, every eligible family benefits from “at least three” schemes. These include the offer of two-bedroom houses to the poor, Raithu Bandhu scheme, which promises Rs 8,000 per acre to each farmer to grow two crops a year, payment of Rs one lakh to the poor for the marriage of a daughter and providing sheep and land to weaker sections. KCR may have learned the fine art of populism from late Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa. But he also may have learned from her experience that such schemes and freebies don’t always guarantee election landslides. Besides, many schemes are still underway. A half-executed promise is like a glass that is half full that, to some, may look half-empty. The creation of a separate state and KCR’s promise of the moon together have raised hopes so high that the TRS government has fallen short of people’s expectations. What makes it worse is that, unlike the TDP, the TRS lacks a robust cadre to beat the government’s drum about welfare schemes at the grassroots level. His government has indeed done some exemplary work, but there is no organisational structure to take this message to the people. KCR dreams of trouncing the   like the late chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy defeated the alliance of TDP, TRS and the Left in 2009 in united Andhra Pradesh. But it looks easier said than done now. Apart from trumpeting his government’s achievements, KCR is doing the only thing he can to win this election: discrediting the alliance. He is doing that by targeting the TDP, pointing out that Naidu’s party had not only opposed Telangana’s formation but was also trying to rob the new state of the benefits of separate statehood. Though the Congress is the main rival of the TRS, he is not focusing his campaign on that party. He had called   but stopped at that and is now training his guns only on Naidu, casting the net of Telangana pride to catch votes. But, in the process, Rao is badmouthing Naidu to an extent that has surprised both his supporters and detractors. He has called Naidu a variety of names such as “ ” (betrayer) and “ ’ (sinner). There is a risk in this for TRS, of course. At least 60 lakh of Telangana’s 3.5-crore population are of Andhra origin and are unlikely to take kindly to the epithets that Rao is hurling at Naidu.

Parth MN,"Dev Sharan Tiwari has an interesting analogy for the days leading up to the first phase of polling in the   on 12 November. Tiwari, a senior journalist based in Bastar district’s Jagdalpur town, said days were now passing by are like the slog overs in cricket. “The forces are determined to encourage voter turnout,” he said. “Maoists are trying to create fear to discourage voters from going to the polls. Both want to score as many runs as possible. We just have to make sure the ball does not hit us in the process.” Tiwari made this comparison in a context. In the 2013 Assembly elections, 68 of the 2,831 polling stations had tallied zero votes in the Bastar division, which goes to polls on Monday. Around 80 polling stations in the Bastar division — which includes Maoists strongholds such as the districts of Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur and Bastar — had polled less than 20 votes. I told Tiwari I would like to visit one of the villages around these polling stations in the heart of a Maoist-hit area, when he came up with the abovementioned advise. Two days later, with a local reporter and his cameraman, I found myself in the village of Sulenga in the interiors of Bastar, not far from the borders of Dantewada and Bijapur. It did not exactly have zero voter turnout, but in the 2014 general elections, Sulenga had polled only around 70 votes. A hilly terrain with dense forests on both sides escorts us through the curvy, quiet, and intimidating road to Sulenga. We first crossed the Chitrakot Police Station — 40 kilometers from Jagdalpur — and then the Mardung Police Station — about 10 to 15 kilometres from Chitrakot. Both were attacked by Maoists a few days ago. Sulenga is 12 to 15 kilometers further from Mardung. A pucca road for the better part of the journey meant that Sulenga was not completely cut off from the outside world like some of the villages in Sukma or Dantewada. Upon reaching the bumpy offshoot of the main road that leads to Sulenga, we met a 13-year-old boy, who had been waiting to hitch a ride to Mardung. “I want to visit a shop,” he said. “My school is also in Mardung. Currently, I am on a Diwali holiday.” The afternoon sun blazing, a few kilometres into a muddy, narrow diversion that runs through the forest into Sulenga, we walked into the home of an old man, stitching a soup that would help filter his paddy harvest. When asked how the election campaign was unfolding in Chhattisgarh, he gave us a bewildered look. “Do you see any flag here?” he said, not taking his eyes off the stitching. “The polling station is not out of reach, but there is always the fear of dadalog.” Dadalog, as Maoists are known in the region, always instil fear among the people around the time of the elections. Rumours say that this time, Maoists have threatened to chop off the fingers of villagers if they were found inked after the polling. Ahead of the 2013 elections, they had wiped out the state leadership of the Congress, murdering   in Bastar in an ambush. On 8 November, an explosion in Dantewada’s Bacheli village killed five people. And on 30 October, Maoists had ambushed security forces in Nilawaya village in Dantewada, in which a journalist working with Doordarshan was killed. However, Vimlendu Jha, the local journalist who travelled with me, was unperturbed. “The   made the mistake of traveling with the security forces,” he said. “Maoists do not usually attack journalists.” Our driver, who had been reluctant to make the journey from the beginning, quickly retorted: “This thought is nice to pacify ourselves. Maoists don’t give you the benefit of doubt. They shoot and then apologise.” As a result, political parties have hardly campaigned in Sulenga. After returning from Sulenga, I met a group of BJP karyakartas campaigning in the constituency. “We only visited Sulenga once,” one of them said. “That is it. We cannot go there repeatedly. Even before we decided to campaign, a lot of meticulous planning went into it. Eight to ten people in a jeep went there, maintained a low profile, met as many people as they could and came back. If the word of our trip had spread, our lives would have been at risk.” However, most of the people we met in Sulenga did not think much of political parties. “Even if we defy dadalog, is the politics worth it?” said a woman, refusing to be photographed. Speaking in the tribal language with Vimlendu, she said: “No matter who comes to power, they are only interested in exploiting our forests. They do not have our interests in mind.” As we continued our interaction, two young men passed us on their bikes. We asked them if they would vote in the impending elections. “Yes,” they said. “At the end of the day, it is the government that builds schools, colleges and hospitals. It is important, and we cannot deny that. Kids in the village would not have been able to study if there had not been a school in Mardung. I have a feeling that the voter turnout from our village would be more than in the previous elections.” The Chhattisgarh administration and state has taken several measures to facilitate as many voters as possible. Fifty drones and 1,000 satellite trackers are being used in Bastar. At least 60,000 additional security forces have been deployed. The District Collector of Dantewada, Saurabh Kumar, said the voter turnout will be higher this time, and the administration is making sure no polling station in the district records zero votes. “We have transferred 18 polling stations away from the sensitive regions. But we cannot force people to vote,” he said. “It has to happen organically. The right of the person to live is more important than his or her right to vote.”",2018-11-11,"Assembly Election 2018,Bastar,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,ConnectTheDots,Jagdalpur,Maoists,Vimlendu Jha",‘Right to life more important than right to vote’: Low-key campaign for Chhattisgarh polls in Maoist strongholds threatens voter turnout,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/right-to-live-more-important-than-right-to-vote-low-key-campaign-for-chhattisgarh-polls-in-maoist-strongholds-threatens-voter-turnout-5530071.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The   are just round the corner, and all the contesting parties are campaigning in full swing. In the first phase of the polls scheduled for 12 November, there are 190 candidates in the fray for 18 constituencies, including Chief Minister Raman Singh. The ruling BJP had lost 12 of these 18 seats in the 2013 polls, but had won 49 seats of the 90 seats in the Assembly. The Congress won 39, the Bahujan Samaj Party one, and an Independent, one. With about a week left for the first phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly election — the second phase is scheduled for 20 November — let’s take a look at a profile of the MLAs who have governed Chhattisgarh for the past five years, as well as the functioning of the state’s 4th Legislative Assembly. Of the 90 sitting MLAs in the Chhattisgarh Assembly, 14 legislators (16 percent) have declared criminal cases against themselves. Of these, seven (8 percent) declared serious criminal cases. This was higher than the 11 of 85 MLAs (13 percent) who had declared criminal cases against them during the 2008 elections. Eight (9 percent) of them had declared serious criminal cases against themselves. Serious criminal cases include offences for which the maximum punishment is of five years or more; a non-bailable offence, an electoral offence such as bribery, offences related to loss to the exchequer or assault, murder, kidnapping or rape, as well as offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and crimes against women. Of the MLAs in the 4th Legislative Assembly of Chhattisgarh who declared criminal cases against themselves, eight (21 percent) were among the 39 Congress MLAs, and six (12 percent) were among the 49 BJP legislators. Of the seven MLAs who declared serious criminal cases in the poll affidavits, five (13 percent) were from the Congress and two (4 percent) were from the BJP. The BSP and Independent candidates in the Assembly did not declare any criminal cases. As many as 66 (73 percent) of the 90 MLAs in the Chhattisgarh Assembly are crorepatis, more than double the number of legislators (30) who had declared such assets in the last elections. Of these 66, 34 MLAs (69 percent) are from the BJP and 30 (77 percent) are from the Congress. The Independent and only BSP candidate, too, declared assets valued more than Rs 1 crore. Moreover, the average of assets per sitting MLA is Rs. 8.75 crore, far higher than the average assets of the 85 MLAs analysed before the 2008 elections,which was Rs 1.47 crore. The average assets of the 49 BJP legislators is Rs 2.15 crore and 39 Congress MLAs is Rs 
17.26 crore. Of the 90 Chhattisgarh Assembly legislators, 34 (38 percent) MLAs have declared their educational qualification to be between 5th pass and 12th pass, while 53 (59 percent) MLAs declared having an educational qualification of a graduate or above. Two MLAs had declared themselves as just literate. The current Chhattisgarh Assembly sat for 145 days, lower than the 159 sitting days of the 3rd 
Assembly (2009-2013). The House held discussions on no-confidence motions on three occasions — in 2015, 2017 and 2018 — which together lasted around 57 hours. Between 2011 and 2016, the Chhattisgarh Assembly sat for an average of 36 days in a year, which is the 8th highest among the 26 state Assemblies that sat on average for 28 days in a year (from 2011 to 2016). Of these 145 days, 98 days (68 percent) were budget session days. While the average duration of each Budget Session of the Chhattisgarh Assembly was 20 days, the average duration of non-budget sessions was much smaller — just four days. Between 2014 and 2018, the highest number of bills introduced in the Chhattisgarh Assembly were in the fields of finance, revenue, and taxation (19), and higher and technical education (11). Among the principal bills introduced were the Chhattisgarh Aadhaar Bill, 2018 and the Chhattisgarh GST Bill, 2017, which was among the 15 bills that were passed the day they were introduced. It was found that 94% of the bills passed were passed within a week of introduction, with limited discussion and scrutiny. Only six bills were passed more than a week after their introduction.",2018-11-10,"Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh MLAs,Chhattisgarh Polls,Criminal Record,FirstData,Infographics,MLAs Education","Chhattisgarh elections: A synopsis of how state's MLAs performed in the last five years, functioning of Assembly",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-elections-a-synopsis-of-how-states-mlas-performed-in-the-last-five-years-functioning-of-assembly-5501691.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first electoral foray in Chhattisgarh Friday, attacking ‘urban Maoists’ and the main Opposition party, the Congress, at a rally in Jagdalpur, the headquarters of insurgency-hit Bastar district. That sounds unexceptionable. It isn’t, because what Modi said undermined some of the fundamental conventions of democracy. Modi was unsparing when he referred to the ‘urban Maoists’, breaking into English to use this phrase in a speech otherwise delivered in Hindi. Though he did not mention anyone by name, he made it pretty obvious that the context he had in mind was the arrest of civil society activists in two batches during this year. He told his audience that these supposedly clandestine Maoists destroyed the lives of tribal children by operating a remote control though they appeared to be sensible, lived clean ‘air-conditioned’ lives, drove big cars and sent their children abroad to pursue their studies. He was equally scathing about the Congress. This party should not be forgiven, he declaimed with what has become signature theatricality, because they supported the ‘urban Maoists’; whenever the government took action against them, the Congress sprang up in their defence. Let us examine these wholly fanciful charges, without prejudice. To begin with, it is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Sangh parivar, more generally, and their fellow travellers who have coined this suggestively misleading (actually untruthful) phrase to describe activists, and others, who work closely for the uplift of tribal people, and to protect their rights, against a system, consisting of politicians, across parties, bureaucrats and entrepreneurs, who engage in their systematic rapine, to exploit the natural resources, mostly minerals and forest resources, that abound in the lands they live in. These supposed Maoists rarely live five-star lives, certainly none of the 10 targeted this year as cogs in the CPI (Maoist) machine. In fact, all of them inhabit a terrain on the opposite end of the spectrum. They lead simple lives and have experienced deprivation even though many of them could have lived fancy lives. One is reminded also of the arrest, in 2007, and incarceration of Dr Binayak Sen for two years on charges of sedition by the Chhattisgarh government until granted bail by the Supreme Court. With his qualifications, Sen could indeed have led a pretty fancy life as a paediatrician but chose to work with the tribal people of Chhattisgarh. His work was internationally recognised, including by the Madhya Pradesh government, which adopted a public-health system designed and operated by a group of people led by him. The point is not entirely Modi’s decision to so obviously peddle an untruth. It also lies in the fact that it is entirely unbecoming of a prime minister to step into such disputatious territory when no charges have been proved, and in some cases even formally made out, against the accused or impugned, depending on your political vantage.  If nothing else, it could well have the effect of vitiating proceedings against people who must be deemed, as matters now stand, innocent. The charges against the Congress are equally ‘trumped up’. There is not even a scintilla of evidence that the party supports Maoist insurgents unless you count the statements issued by the party’s president, Rahul Gandhi, and other leaders protesting the draconian measures undertaken by BJP governments to stifle dissent in any form. It would be wholly contextual to recall Rahul’s ironical comment, made in August when five activists were held by the Maharashtra police in coordinated dawn raids in several cities spread over various states, to the effect that there was room for only one NGO in India: the RSS. There was so much of truth in that statement that it stung, provoking the usual hysterical reactions from the BJP. The point is that such verbal protests cannot be construed as constituting support for the Maoists, unless one has a taste for pretty bizarre logical calisthenics. As a matter of fact, the Congress is as anti-Maoist, and anti-tribal people, as the BJP. A Congress leader, Mahendra Karma, was, in fact, responsible for forming the Salwa Judum group of vigilantes to take on the Maoists in 2005. The group was disbanded following a Supreme Court order passed in 2011, declaring it illegal and unconstitutional. Karma was assassinated by Naxals in 2013. The record will show that Congress leaders have suffered more at the hands of Maoists than those of the BJP. There's more. While accusing the Congress of sabotaging the process of tribal uplift, Modi also claimed that only his party was committed to serving tribal people, while the Congress was interested only in dehumanising the underprivileged and poor by using them as vote banks, the nauseatingly familiar rhetorical charge deployed by the BJP in a variety of contexts. He also claimed that his government had done more in four-and-a-half year than what two previous, United Progressive Alliance governments had in ten years. This absurd claim overlooks, of course, the obvious fact that a BJP government has been in place in Chhattisgarh for 15 years, during which time, including in the last five years, there has been no perceptible improvement in the condition of tribal people. If anything, the incursions into and depredations on their lands and lives have intensified. A common thread ties all these elements in Modi’s speech and make them consistent and comprehensible. This thread is woven from the unreconstructed desire and willingness of BJP leaders, in both the party and government, to stretch and manipulate facts to suit themselves without the slightest concern for their ‘truth value’. The duopoly comprising Modi and BJP president Amit Shah have put in place an institutional framework and promoted a political culture—one has to admit with singular, ruthless and frightening success—in which all that matters is winning elections and thereafter monopolising power, when the need arises by subverting every institution, convention and law available for manipulation. This is a problem in and by itself. What makes this unifocal political frame of reference ineluctably dangerous is the contribution of people who hold important, sometimes constitutional, positions to make it work. When the prime minister bends his energies towards this end, democracy, however otherwise flawed, is irretrievably compromised. It is most alarming (unfortunate, in this context, would be too anodyne a description) that Modi, as prime minister, should systematically work towards engineering and embracing a system whose proximate objective and likely end is the destruction of liberal, constitutional democracy. Perhaps such lamentation is pointless. It is widely known after all that the precise aim of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar that undergirds and nourishes it is the unmaking of all forms of liberal politics and the inauguration of a ‘golden age’ of majoritarian authoritarianism in which dissentient voices will be silenced: once and forever.",2018-11-10,"Arun Ferreira,Assembly Election 2018,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Bastar,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Constitution,Constitution Of India,Gautam Navlakha,InMyOpinion,Internal Security,Karuna Shukla,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajnandgaon,Raman Singh,Rona Wilson,Shoma Sen,Sudha Bharadwaj,Sudhir Dhawale,Urban Naxals,Varvara Rao,Vernon Gonsalves","Narendra Modi in Chhattisgarh: By peddling untruths in Jagdalpur speech, PM undermined democracy's fundamental conventions",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modi-in-chhattisgarh-by-peddling-untruths-in-jagdalpur-speech-pm-undermined-democracys-fundamental-conventions-5530391.html,firstpost,-1,0
Natasha Trivedi,"Nearly half of Kanker, a district in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar division, is under forest cover. According to official data,  is taken up by forests, a resource that is vitally important to the tribal communities, which depend on non-timber forest produce (NTFP) to supplement their income from agriculture. In the district’s Antagarh block, which is also a reserved Assembly seat for Scheduled Tribes in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, farmers collect an abundance of imli (tamarind) and sal seeds during the non-agriculture season. They sell the produce to middlemen or contractors in bazaars for a rate that is decided by the buyers. “The government does offer minimum support price (MSP) on forest products, but it is almost always less than what the contractors offer,” said Malti Kunjam, president of the Kankalin women’s self-help group (SHG) in Koliary village of the Amabeda panchayat. “So even though they exploit us by not giving a price that matches the effort involved in the collection process, we have no choice but to sell it to them.” “Why shouldn’t we sell to a buyer offering a higher price?” she asks. Arvind Netam, former Union minister and senior tribal rights activist said: “One of the main economies of the tribal areas is forest produce, but the traders — and not the government — are dominant in deciding the pricing. That is unfortunate.” For 2018, the Chhattisgarh government had set the MSP for   whereas contractors offer two or three rupees more on each. and it is a major activity for at least six months in a year. In her home in Koliary, Kunjam sits beside sacks of tamarind worth Rs 26,000. The product has been bought in bulk by the SHG from local villagers. In May,  , the district administration had promised the group a food processing machine to make tamarind pickle. “Block officials had come to our village and said they would conduct a training session to teach us to make imli pickle and also provide a food processing machine. They had said they would take the pickle to Raipur, accompanied by one of our SHG members, and sell it and give us the profit,” said the group’s 40-year-old secretary, Kaneshwari Salam. Six months later, there is still no sign of the machine or of a training session. The perishable product is now packed in air-tight polythene bags in Kunjam’s storeroom. Salam said: “They gave us an unwritten statement that the block administration would take responsibility for the loss if the stock gets spoilt. We have no way of contacting the officials other than a phone number that is not in use, and we haven’t gone to the block office because we have been busy on the farm during the Kharif season” The female farmers of the Amabeda panchayat are not surprised by the government’s no-show. They are disillusioned by the Raman Singh-led administration and believe that it has not worked in the interest of farmers. Kamla Shukla, secretary of the SHG in Gedgaon village and member of a tribal rights’ forum, said, “The BJP has been campaigning a lot, but I have not heard any tribal or farmers’ issues being spoken about. They mostly talk about vikas (development) in general.” “In my opinion, people should assert their democratic power in changing the government, then all the parties will take their policies regarding tribal rights more seriously.” Sukaya Kashyap, 46, has been working with an NGO in the tribal-dominated block for the past 15 years. “Farmers and the tribal community in general in this area are not happy with the government. Even though people living in the interiors are not as aware about schemes, benefits and their rights, they have started to understand that promises made by the government have not materialised. She said that people in the Antagarh block were angry about demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). “People affected by note bandi (demonetisation) will not vote the current government back to power. Owners of small businesses, who have been affected by the implementation of GST, have also said they will not vote for the BJP,” Kashyap added. Shukla says that in villages in the Amabeda panchayat, people have been threatened with consequences, including the cancellation of their ration, cards if they don’t vote for the BJP. “People have not been informed about government schemes and how they work. In some villages, they have been told by some BJP workers that their ration cards will get cancelled if the party doesn’t form the government again,” she claimed. “The tribal people don’t know that a Public Distribution System is a system mandated by law under the National Food Security Act, 2013,” she pointed out. However, Urmilla Netam, 40, a farmer of Gedgaon village, said she will vote based on the choice the village makes together. This practice has been an issue for social workers across districts. Sunita Kunjam, a social worker, said that sometimes, the tribal community follows a “herd mentality” when it comes to casting their vote. “The people either vote according to who the leader of the village votes for, or they vote based on which party is already in power. A lot of people also don’t know about or understand the concept of NOTA (none of the above),” she explained.

FP Staff,"From getting rid of some Muslim names of places to promising a 'grand' statue of the Hindu god Ram, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is making passionate appeals to its hard-core Hindu nationalist base in the most politically important state ahead of a national election next year. A near clean-sweep in Uttar Pradesh, the state of 220 million people that sends the highest number of lawmakers to the lower house of parliament, helped Narendra Modi win his party's biggest mandate in three decades in 2014. Political strategists say keeping its mainly Hindu base intact in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere would be crucial to repeat such a performance, but there are also concerns that the BJP has been turning up the heat on divisive religious issues. Yogi Adityanath, a robe-wearing Hindu priest who is the BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday   district to Ayodhya, the place where Hindus believe Lord Ram was born thousands of years ago. Before the change, Ayodhya was the name of a town in Faizabad. Last month, he  , where three rivers considered holy by Hindus meet, to the Hindu name Prayagraj. Both Faizabad and Allahabad were Islamic names given to places hundreds of years ago by India’s then Muslim rulers. ""Ayodhya is our honour, prestige and pride,"" Adityanath said at an event in the town, declaring the name change amid loud cheers from the audience. “Ayodhya is identified with Lord Ram.” He said the state would decide on a location for a statue of Ram that could become an Ayodhya landmark. He also promised to open an airport in the district that would be named after Ram. Many leaders of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), BJP's ideologue, are demanding the government issue an executive order that would bypass the Supreme Court so that they can build a Ram temple at a highly controversial religious site in Ayodhya. The destruction of a mosque on that site by a frenzied Hindu mob in 1992 sparked deadly riots across the country. At the moment the site is under court control. There are fears that communal tensions between the majority Hindu population and Muslims, the biggest minority group in India with more than 170 million people, could flare again if the status quo is disturbed. The moves aren’t limited to Uttar Pradesh. In Gujarat, the BJP government there is also considering  , a name given to it by a former Muslim ruler. On the heels of Adityanath's announcement, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut made a jibe at Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, asking when he would rename Aurangabad and Osmanabad.""Yogi Adityanath has renamed Allahabad and Faizabad to Pragyaraj and Ayodhya. When will CM Devendra Fadnavis rename Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar and Osmanabad as Dharashiv?""  His tweet came soon after Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said the BJP government in the state would be   if it got the required support from people. On Thursday morning, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said the state government will take ""concrete steps"" to   after assessing ""legal and all other angles"". Another BJP MLA from Telangana, Raja Singh triggered a fresh row after he said that he would work towards renaming the city of Hyderabad as ‘Bhagyanagar’ if the BJP was voted to power in the state in the upcoming Telangana elections.   Singh said, ""Earlier, Hyderabad was Bhagyanagar and in 1590 Quli Qutub Shah came to Hyderabad, he changed Bhagyanagar to Hyderabad. At that time many Hindus were attacked and many temples destroyed. We are planning to rename Hyderabad.

FP Staff,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared combative when he took on rival Congress by linking the party with 'Urban Naxals' as part of the BJP's campaign for the upcoming Chhattisgarh Assembly election at a rally in Jagdalpur on Friday. The state votes on 12 November in the first phase of polls for 18 Assembly seats. In 2013, the BJP had lost 12 out the 18 seats, which makes the first phase a critical one for the saffron party. The prime minister tore through the Opposition and touched upon a host of topics, including Naxal violence, development in the Bastar region and its connectivity with the rest of the country. Addressing his first election rally in the state, Modi said he will not rest till he fulfills late Atal Bihari Vajpayee's dreams for a prosperous Chhattisgarh. Modi said the Congress-led government did not do enough to develop the Naxal-affected Bastar region citing the Maoist menace. ""The urban Maoists, who live in air-conditioned homes in the cities, look clean and whose children study abroad, remote control the adivasi children in the Naxal-dominated areas,"" Modi said. Focussing on the Bastar region, the prime minister alleged that the Opposition was disrupting the government’s crackdown on Naxals. ""Will you forgive such people? These people will not win Chhattisgarh. I appeal to you to ensure that BJP wins all seats in the Bastar region. If anyone else wins, it will be a blot on Bastar's dreams,"" he added. Recently, two attacks made headlines when security forces were ambushed in   and another  . The first attack claimed the live of a cameraperson employed with Doordarshan. In another attack on Thursday, Naxals killed five, including two Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, near Bacheli in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district. “I urge the people of Bastar to teach a fitting lesson to the Congress leaders, who on one hand try to shield the urban Maoists, and in Chhattisgarh, they speak about freeing the state from Maoists” “I kept my promise of rail and road connectivity,” Modi said, referring to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and other regional connectivity schemes. “In the past four years, more than 9,000 villages have been connected by roads. Not just that but by spending approximately Rs 35,000 crores, the work for a 3,000 kilometre National Highway Project was started by the BJP government,” the prime minister said. “These highways are not only meant for plying cars but they become important to improve the financial conditions of the state. We have spent approximately Rs 12,000 crore for the approval of seven new railway lines. Approvals to widen the 1500 kilometre rail-line were also granted,” he added. Talking about the region’s development due to the co-operation between the state and the central government, he asked, “Did anyone ever think that people would be able to fly to Delhi and back from Jagdalpur? Did anyone think that Bastar would have its own medical college and university?” Recounting Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s contribution, Modi said that it was because of Vajpayee that a separate ministry for tribals and separate budgets for them were introduced. He alleged that the Congress makes fun of tribals' attire and culture, and thinks only of the Gandhis, whereas the BJP thinks of the people. ""I don't know why Congress makes fun of adivasis. Once, I had gone for a rally in North East India India and wore a traditional adivasi headgear but Congress leaders made fun of it. This was an insult of adivasi culture,"" he said. Modi made an apparent reference to comments by  , who had said that the prime minister wears 'outlandish' Naga headgear, but refuses to sport a Muslim skull cap. ""Dalits, backward classes and the poor are a treasure for the Congress party,"" Modi said. For ten years, Congress was at the Centre, but they never paid attention to the needs of Chhattisgarh and blocked all development for the state. They never thought of the region's progress. ""Congress does not have any future. The party that lives by lies does not have a place on Earth. Our only mantra is development, their work is only lying,"" Modi said. The state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in the year 2000. Speaking about the state completing 18 years Modi recounted, “When Chhattisgarh was a part of Madhya Pradesh, Atalji observed that even when Congress ruled Madhya Pradesh for years, people had to go hungry in this region... for this purpose, Atal Bihari Vajpayee created a separate state of Chhattisgarh” “Chhattisgarh has turned 18. Now the requirements of the state are different. The parents of an 18-year-old also have to alter their budget when he/she turns 18. So, even the government sitting in Delhi is working to fulfill the dreams of this 18-year-old Chhattisgarh,” he added. Talking about the state politics he said,”Caste dominated Chhattisgarh politics, but that will not be the case anymore.” Talking about the “wave of development in Chhattisgarh” Modi said: “How did this development in Chhattisgarh happen? There were governments in power earlier, but there was no development. The reason for that is because we did away with the middlemen.” He mentioned how resources were there previously too, but there was “no political will” and alleged that the earlier governments were corrupt and inept. “I am committed to  . We do not differentiate between castes, gender, poor or rich, we only believe in ' .' We want everyone to be with us and we want development for everyone”, Modi said. “Every corner of this region is a way for development today. This is because both the state and the central government worked together. Did anyone think that Bastar would have its own medical college and university?” Chief minister Raman Singh had welcomed the prime minister in Jagdalpur and was also present at the rally. During his speech, he said, “Nobody in Bastar sleeps hungry at night. Electricity will be brought to every nook and corner of Bastar.” ""Modi's vision and thinking have brought this change in Bastar. I am assuring you that this is just the start. In the coming days, development in Bastar will happen at a greater pace,” he added. Modi concluded his speech by urging the people of the state to help the BJP in making way for a “new state and a new Bastar.""",2018-11-09,"Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Jagadalupur,Narendra Modi In Chhattisgarh,NewsTracker,TheySaidIt","Narendra Modi, in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, questions Congress' support to 'Urban Naxals': Key highlights from PM's rally in Jagdalpur",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modi-in-poll-bound-chhattisgarh-questions-congress-support-to-urban-naxals-key-highlights-from-pms-rally-in-jagdalpur-5525211.html,firstpost,-1,0
Madhav Sharma," Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Hanuman Beniwal seems to have shaken the corridors of power in the poll-bound Rajasthan when he formed Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) on 29 October. If Beniwal is to be believed, his new outfit is an alternative to both the “corrupt” BJP and the Congress in the state, which goes to Assembly elections on 7 December. He is confident of RLP's victory in about 130 of 200 Assembly seats in Rajasthan. With political pundits saying that he can definitely upset the poll equations in the state, Beniwal, a Jat leader and independent MLA from the state’s Khinvsar constituency, has become the subject of discussion. Beniwal managed to draw a huge crowd in his Monday’s rally and has already organised five   rallies. The BJP had suspended the former president of the University of Rajasthan ahead of the 2013 polls after Beniwal levelled corruption charges against Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. In the Assembly polls, he proved his mettle by defeating BJP candidate in the Khinvsar constituency by 23,020 votes. The RLP and rebel BJP legislator Ghanshyam Tiwari’s Bharat Vahini Party (BVP) are expected to form a strong third front in Rajasthan, which is already believed to be slipping out of the BJP’s hands. My supporters and I have worked on the ground in around 130 seats of Rajasthan. As (tribal leader) Kirodi Lal Meena left us in between (to join the BJP), we are not making any claim on the remaining 70 seats dominated by the scheduled tribes. But, if we are able to secure a tie-up with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), there will be a tough battle in all the 200 constituencies of the state. Primarily, the Jats, the Meghwals, the Muslims, the Yadavs and the Kumawats are with us. Our ally, the BVP and its founder have a huge appeal among the upper castes, especially the Brahmins. So we are expecting major backing from them too. We are in touch with the top brass of the BSP. As of now, the party’s vice-president has indicated they are ready to form an alliance. The BSP has a strong grip in the eastern Rajasthan, and with its support, we can get more seats. Everybody knows about the presence of “agents” in both the parties. The agents will act as brokers of Assembly tickets. I was in the BJP in 2003 and saw this happening in my Khinvsar seat. There are leaders in both parties who have mass connection but never get tickets because of the agents. If people with a “clean” slate want to join us, we will extend our hand towards them. But we are not going to accept their “garbage”. I am not aware of any other alliances. We have not talked to them yet. The main issue is loan waiver for farmers and their economic prosperity. We will fight for special status to the state and seek funds from the Centre. If they will not provide financial support, we will launch a massive protest. The announcement of free electricity for farmers was an outcome of the battle we fought on the streets. We will also converge the major canal projects and work for the uplift of micro-industries. We will not support any party. We will opt for re-elections. Both (Congress’) Ashok Gehlot and (BJP’s) Raje have become the faces of corruption. We have formed our own party and there is no chance of supporting them. Both parties have looted Rajasthan for 70 years. Our battle is ideological. Raje has killed the fundamentals of democratic values. Under the BJP and the Congress rules, ‘ ’ came, but only for big businessmen. The loan burden of state discoms has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore. We are talking about complete loan waiver for farmers that has burdened the sons of the land. The government is getting revenue of Rs 20,000 crore from liquor sale. If we come to power, we will use this money for the welfare of farmers, youth and underprivileged sections of the state. There is a big scam in the electricity department where the same bureaucrats are holding the positions. Neither the BJP nor the Congress has removed them. We are demanding an audit of accounts of the past 17 years. The Lokayukta recommended that the home department register 15 complaints against chief ministers, ministers and bureaucrats of Rajasthan involved in mining and other scams, but the state government did not take any action. The document is fake and has been circulated by the other parties. This was the reason behind my fight against Raje too. The government should continue with reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. After evaluating the population of other backward classes, the quota should be increased. Reservation should be on the basis of financial status, so that the poor can rise. The two major parties have 10 youngsters at every booth, but in 130 booths, we have a team of 50 youngsters at work. The youth of the state have been duped by both the Congress and the BJP. We want water for all, proper utilisation of minerals and ore besides allotment of land deeds to the farmers. The memorandums signed should be executed so that the youth can get jobs. We want to free the people from toll tax.

Talking to a regional news channel in Patna over telephone, he extended his greetings to younger brother Tejashwi Yadav on his birthday, but said he would not be able to join the celebrations in New Delhi, where the RJD heir apparent has gone to meet their sisters. The mercurial RJD leader was last seen in Bodh Gaya on Saturday where he had checked in at a hotel   at a hospital in Ranchi. Lalu Prasad is learnt to have been upset over his elder son's decision to seek divorce. He is serving sentences in a number of fodder scam cases. At present, he is lodged at a hospital in Ranchi on medical grounds. Tej Pratap Yadav and Aishwarya Rai — daughter of RJD MLA Chandrika Rai and grandchild of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai — had tied the knot on 12 May.

Until they agree with me, how can I return home?"" Yadav said. The former Bihar minister also expressed displeasure over the role played by some of his close relatives, including in-laws, in his marital dispute. In an apparent rebuttal of reports that he has been feeling slighted over the growing clout of his younger brother, Yadav said, ""I offer my blessings to Tejashwi. May he become the next chief minister of Bihar. I would be by his side and help him the way Krishna had assisted Arjuna in the battle of Mahabharata"".

But please do not jump to any conclusions upon hearing this,"" Bhola told reporters.

FP Staff,"With the first phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections are just a few days away, all major parties have finalised their candidates' lists and expedited campaign in their respective constituencies. The election to the 90 seats in the state are scheduled to be held on 12 and 20 November, making Chhattisgarh the only state this time where voting will be held in two phases. The alliance between former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) made headlines when she announced it in September. The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fielded their power players from their strongholds. Rahul Gandhi's party is seeking to oust the saffron party in the state, where it has been in power since 2003 under Chief Minister Raman Singh. Although the BJP had formed the government in Chhattisgarh for the third time with 49 of the 90 seats, the Congress (39 seats) had succeeded in narrowing the vote share. It had grabbed 40.3 percent of the votes, marginally lower than the BJP's 41 percent. As the Congress and BJP as well as the JCC-BSP-Communist Party of India (CPI) alliance have all released the final lists of the candidates, here are some of the key players in the fray: The BJP leader has enjoyed three terms as the chief minister of the state — 2003-2008, 2008-2013 and 2013-present. Singh is the second chief minister after the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000. This year, he will contest from the Rajnandgaon constituency — his birthplace — seeking a fourth term in a row. It was under Singh's tenure, the   for its human development index. He is also a qualified Ayurveda doctor besides a  , National e-Governance award, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam award and the National Water Digest award. The Chhattisgarh Congress president will contest from the Patan Assembly constituency. It is assumed that he will be one of the   if the party comes to power in the state, besides TS Singhdeo and Charan Das Mahant. Baghel has been embroiled in a controversy over his alleged involvement in a fake sex CD case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed a chargesheet in September, in which it had named Baghel and a few others as accused. The controversial CD allegedly featured a state minister, who had rejected it as fake. The BJP has used this case to target the Congress ahead of the polls, while Baghel has pleaded innocence and described it as a political attack. Ajit Jogi, who was the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, dealt a blow to the Congress by allying his newly-formed JCC with the BSP and the CPI.   that after a three-hour meeting with Mayawati, she agreed to join hands with him for the Assembly polls in the state. After the BSP-JCC alliance was formally announced on 20 September,   Jogi as the chief ministerial candidate from their alliance. The CPI joined the duo in October, with Jogi saying that its entry as an ally will strengthen their prospects in the Bastar, Surguja and Bhilai regions. While there was no clarity earlier on whether Jogi would even contest the elections, the JCC confirmed on Wednesday that he will contest the polls from Marwahi constituency. His son Amit is the sitting MLA from Marwahi, which is a reserved scheduled tribe constituency. While Amit will not contest the Assembly elections this time, his mother and Jogi's wife, Renu Jogi, will contest the polls on a JCC ticket from Kota after Congress did not consider her this time.

Sundrani is the sitting legislator from Raipur City North. The constituency has 25,000 Sindhi voters, who constitute a major vote bank for the BJP. Devti Karma is the sitting Congress MLA from the Dantewada (scheduled tribe) seat. She is the wife of late Mahendra Karma, a former Leader of Opposition who was the guiding force behind the ""Salwa Judum"" movement of anti-Maoist vigilante groups. He was also among the group of 29 — of mostly Congress leaders — who were killed in the Maoist attack in Bastar district's Darbha Valley on 25 May 2013.

The saffron party has been in power in the state for the past three terms. According to C-voter's prediction from November 2018, the Congress will get 118 seats while the BJP will get 106 seats. In this scenario, the Congress would cross the halfway mark (115) with a wafer-thin margin in a 230-member Legislative Assembly. The difference in the vote share between the two parties is also extremely small, with the Congress expected to get 42.3 percent votes and the BJP expected to garner 41.5 percent of the vote share.

The regional equation and the relative strength of the two parties in various regions may decide the election,"" the survey states. In what comes as good news for the Congress, party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia is considerably more popular than Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan at present. Given a specific choice between Scindia and Chouhan, 51.3 percent voters would choose the former over the latter. However, challenges for the grand old party include infighting, and the possibility that the Narendra Modi factor will tilt the scales in favour of the BJP. Two regions where the gap between the BJP and the Congress is small could well be key to the result of the battle: Mahakaushal (where the BJP is expected to win 21 seats as against the Congress' 20) and Nimar (where the BJP is expected to win 19 seats as against the Congress' 9).",2018-11-09,"Assembly Elections 2018,BJP,C-Voter,Congress,Jyotiraditya Scindia,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,NewsTracker,Shivraj Singh Chouhan","Madhya Pradesh election: Congress ahead of BJP in close race; Jyotiraditya Scindia most popular CM face, says C-voter survey",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-election-congress-ahead-of-bjp-in-close-race-jyotiraditya-scindia-most-popular-cm-face-says-c-voter-survey-5526661.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": A day ahead of 'Tipu Jayanti', the BJP on Friday staged protests against Karnataka government-sponsored celebrations for the birth anniversary of the controversial 18th century ruler of erstwhile Mysore kingdom, Tipu Sultan. The party, which has appealed to the government to drop the celebrations, staged demonstrations at several places including Bengaluru, Mysuru and Kodagu, in the state. The JDS-Congress coalition government led by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, last week, had said Tipu Jayanti would be celebrated on 10 November in continuation of the previous Congress government's policy, prompting the BJP to announce protests. However, Kumaraswamy is not scheduled to attend main function here to be inaugurated by Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara. The Chief Minister's Office in a statement said on Friday that Kumaraswamy would not take part in any official function for the next three days in view of ""doctors' advice."" “On the advice of doctors, the chief minister will take three days rest till 11 November. He will spend time with family on these days and there will be no official engagements on these days,” it said. Minister for Minority Welfare, Haj and Wakf BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan said the chief minister had told officials before hand that he would be away for medical check-up and hence, his name should not be mentioned in the invitation. Police said security has been tightened at sensitive places, including Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Kodagu. An official said the function in Bengaluru would be held at the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the state legislature, as the original venue, in view of representations to the government from Mulsim community leaders. Parameshwara, who also holds the Home portfolio, had on 5 November announced that the venue had been shifted to Ravindra Kalakshetra here on advice of the police department owing to security reasons. He had said strict action would be taken against anyone causing riots or disturbing peace. Tipu Jayanti celebration events should be organised indoors and posters and banners would be allowed there only, he had said, adding that social media posts would also be monitored and action would be taken if they were derogatory. The previous Congress government, led by Siddaramaiah, began celebrating ""Tipu Jayanti"" on 10 November every year since 2015, amid stiff opposition by the BJP, several Hindu organisations and some individuals. Widespread protests and violence had marred the celebrations during the first two years. BJP leaders, including former deputy chief minister R Ashok, BY Raghavendra and MLC Ravi Kumar, took part in the agitation here and accused the state government of ""hurting"" the sentiments of Hindus only to appease Muslims. They said Tipu was accused of killing thousands of people in Kodagu and Mandyam Iyengars of Melukote near Mysuru. “Tipu was a tyrant and a religious fanatic. Those who tried to exalt him suffered huge losses,” BJP MP Pratap Simha claimed. The BJP also took a dig at Kumaraswamy's absence in the event. Party spokesperson S Prakash quipped that the chief minister was avoiding taking part in Tipu Jayanti. Tipu was a ruler of Mysore and considered an implacable enemy of the British East India Company. He was killed in May 1799 while defending his fort at Srirangapatna against the British forces. While BJP and some Hindu outfits see Tipu as a ""religious bigot"" and a ""brutal killer"", some Kannada outfits call him anti-Kannada, saying that he had promoted Persian at the cost of the local language.",2018-11-09,"Bengaluru,BJP,HD Kumaraswamy,Karnataka,Kodagu,Mysuru,NewsTracker,Tipu Jayanti,Tipu Sultan","BJP stages protests in Bengaluru, Mysuru and Kodagu day ahead of Tipu Jayanti; security tightened across Karnataka",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-stages-protests-in-bengaluru-mysuru-and-kodagu-day-ahead-of-tipu-jayanti-security-tightened-across-karnataka-5526801.html,firstpost,-1,0

Madhya Pradesh, which has a 230-seat Assembly, goes to vote on 28 November. The counting is scheduled for 11 December. Distribution of tickets has become a challenge for parties due to various demands from many castes and communities. ""People from upper-caste communities and those against reservation have openly confronted leaders of both the BJP and Congress in various parts of Madhya Pradesh.

FP Staff,"  With just three days to go for the first phase of Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh that votes on Monday (12 November), a   analysis on Friday that was done for ABP News and Republic TV predicted a neck-and-neck race between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Opposition Congress as the two parties clash with each other to secure a majority big enough to form the next government in the state. In a nutshell, the tighter the contest, the higher the chances of a hung Assembly. The study that was done with a sample size of 13,911 respondents found that the vote share difference between Congress and the BJP has narrowed down to 0.2 percent from 1.2 percent between August 2018 to November 2018. In 2013 also, the difference between the vote share of the two parties was a mere 0.7 percent. Given these statistics, the 0.2 percent margin is the closest that the pollsters have arrived at concerning the state. ""The reason for the same is vote splitting by Ajit Jogi who continues to command a loyal band of followers who are ditching the Congress for him. Thus, even in this case, Congress is unable to capitalise on triple term anti-incumbency,"" the study said. In August this year, the BJP had a vote share of 38.8 percent while the Congress had 40 percent. The figure changed in September to 38.6 percent for the BJP and 38.9 percent for the Congress followed by 40.1 percent in October for the BJP and 40 percent for the Congress. What is notable is the scale at which the numbers tilted towards BJP's favour, although it remains to be seen if that would be sufficient for it to retain power for the fourth time in a row. As per the study, Congress was likely to win 54 seats as against the BJP's 33 in 90-member Assembly, according to circumstances that prevailed in August this year. The remaining three seats would have gone to others. However, within a month, the Congress' tally fell by seven seats to 47 while that of the BJP increased by the same number of seats to 40 in September. October proved to be a month of woes for the Congress as it slipped to 42 seats, while the BJP increased its expected tally to 43. The seats won by others also went up to five, which were at three in the previous month. In the current month, Congress lost one more seat, according to the survey, even as the BJP maintained its score at 43. The seat that went out of the Congress' kitty was gained by others taking their figure to six seats. In the last Assembly election in 2013, BJP had won 49 seats while the Congress won 39, with the remaining two going to others. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi now getting into campaign mode, the challenges for the Congress are only going to rise as there is a possibility that the anti-incumbency factor that may exist against the Raman Singh government might reduce. With former chief minister and ex-Congress leader Ajit Jogi stitching a surprising tie-up with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party right under the nose of the state Congress leadership at the last moment, this alliance could not have come at a worse time for the Congress. What may be assuring to the BJP is that its incumbent chief minister is far ahead of his rivals, with 45.3 percent of the respondents wanting him to continue, while Jogi who now heads his own party Chhattisgarh Janata Congress is a favourite of 35.1 percent people who participated in the survey. The stark vacuum that is apparent from the study is the lack of faces in the Congress camp who could command enough stature to at least challenge Singh. The   survey done for   and   has given BJP 50 seats, with 30 for the Congress. The others get 10 seats as per that survey. The   study conducted for   gives 56 seats to the BJP while the Congress is likely to win in 25 constituencies. The others get nine seats in the survey.",2018-11-09,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Raman Singh","Chhattisgarh polls: CVoter predicts a cliffhanger but Narendra Modi, Raman Singh give BJP edge over Congress",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-polls-cvoter-predicts-a-cliffhanger-but-narendra-modi-raman-singh-give-bjp-edge-over-congress-5526621.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"Coming down heavily on 'Urban Naxals' in his first election rally in Chhatisgarh ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a vent to his anger by saying they have  (psyche of a demon) who put guns in the hands of young boys and girls who should otherwise have been holding pens in their hands. ""They burn schools, not allow doctors to visit schools. They are 'Urban Naxals'. They live in the comforts of air-conditioners in the cities. They look neat and clean and live in well-built houses. Their children study abroad. They move around in big cars, mingle in upper echelons of society and carry a certain aura about them. They live in urban centres but use a remote system to destroy lives of tribals living here,"" Modi said. This was thus far the strongest condemnation of 'Urban Naxals' from a public platform and from no less than the prime minister. The issue was widely debated at various public platforms since the Maharashtra government launched an inter-state multi-city crackdown in August against 'Urban Naxals' and arrested Varvara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Gautam Navlakha and Stan Swamy. Five other Naxal sympathisers including Rona Wilson, Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut and Surendra Gadling were earlier arrested in Maharashtra and Delhi in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon case. Soon after at the behest of the Congress, various opposition parties challenged their arrest, terming it an assault on freedom of expression and right to dissent. Congress president Rahul Gandhi came out strongly in their support and in a tweet lampooned Modi government. “There is only place for one NGO in India and it's called the RSS. Shut down all other NGOs. Jail all activists and shoot those that complain. Welcome to the new India,” he said in a tweet. Historian Romila Thapar petitioned the Supreme Court seeking relief for the alleged 'Urban Naxals'. The political colouring around the debate made it a BJP versus the rest kind of debate, almost completely ignoring the national security angle. The Congress party leaders including Rahul conveniently forgot that Manmohan Singh as prime minister had once declared that Maoists are the biggest threat to India's internal security. Modi used Congress attempts to defend 'Urban Naxals' to launch a blistering attack on the BJP’s electoral rival. ""The Congress must respond when the government takes action against 'Urban Naxals' why do they come out to defend them, make statements in their favour? Congress leaders come to this state and make inconsequential remarks against Naxals. Will you forgive such people? These people will not win Chhattisgarh. I appeal to you to ensure that BJP wins all seats in the Bastar region. If anyone else wins, it will be a blot on Bastar's dreams,"" the prime minister said. Eighteen seats in the Naxal-affected areas of the state are going to the polls on Monday. Since the winning margin has always been thin in the state, the polling pattern and results of these seats can decide whether or not BJP’s serving chief minister will get a chance to serve for a record fourth term. Modi and the BJP would hope with some tangible development initiatives and making it slightly emotive three days before polls, the BJP would retain its edge. It was also interesting to see that Modi recalled Atal Bihari Vajpayee, his role in creating the separate state of Chhattisgarh and his dream for the state to strike yet another emotive chord with the people. Vajpayee originally belonged to Madhya Pradesh, a state which Chhatisgarh was a part of till the Vajpayee-led NDA government created it 18 years ago. The former prime minister’s name thus still resonates among the people. Another reason why Modi repeatedly took Vajpayee's name was perhaps because his niece Karuna Shukla has joined Congress and is fighting against Raman Singh in Rajnandgaon. The BJP would hope that people would come out in large numbers on Monday to express their preferences.",2018-11-09,"Arun Ferreira,Assembly Election 2018,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,BJP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Gautam Navlakha,Internal Security,Karuna Shukla,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajnandgaon,Raman Singh,Rona Wilson,Shoma Sen,Sudha Bharadwaj,Sudhir Dhawale,Urban Naxals,Varvara Rao,Vernon Gonsalves","In Chhattisgarh, Narendra Modi tears into Congress for backing 'Urban Naxals' in maiden campaign rally for BJP ahead of polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/in-chhattisgarh-narendra-modi-tears-into-congress-for-backing-urban-naxals-in-maiden-campaign-rally-for-bjp-ahead-of-polls-5526041.html,firstpost,-1,0
Karishma S," Gandhwani, an Assembly constituency held by the Congress, is dominated by female voters. However, the irony is that Gandhwani has no female doctors due to which women have to travel several kilometres for basic health care. Gandhwani and Kukshi are the Congress' constituencies in Dhar district, in which the remaining constituencies namely Dhar, Manawar, Badnawar, Sardarpur and Dharampuri belong to the BJP. These constituencies have female doctors. The community health centre (CHC) in Kukshi has a female doctor, but due to lack of facilities, most of the patients are often referred to other hospitals. “Four blocks — Bagh, Dahi, Kukshi and Nisarpur — fall under the Kukshi tehsil and I am the only female doctor here. I am on duty round-the-clock. I am also responsible for the administrative works like going to court for hearings and making MLCs,” said Dr Rajkumari Devda, a gynaecologist, posted at the Kukshi CHC. According to Dr Devda, due to lack of basic facilities like sonography machines, or an ICU, local patients suffering serious health problems are referred to Barwani district hospital, 30 kilometres from Kukshi. “Dhar is at least 100 km from Kukshi, so we refer the patients to Barwani district,” she said. According to the Election Commission, there are over 1.1 lakh female voters in Gandhwani, constituting 49.8% of the total voters in the constituency. Alleging step-motherly treatment towards their Assembly constituency by the state government, the Congress leader from Gandhwani, Umang Singhar, claims that the situation is better in other constituencies where BJP is in power. He claims that the medical facilities for women in Manawar, a constituency reserved for the scheduled tribe and is represented by BJP’s Ranjana Baghel, is much better as compared to Gandhwani and Kukshi. Singhar says that he had announced Rs 1 lakh salary per month to any female doctor who was willing to come to Gandhwani CHC. He says that since he is from the Opposition party, he has suffered injustice at the hands of the state government. “The state government had said that it was unable to send a female doctor because of dearth of female doctors in the state,” he said. Women in this constituency are reluctant to approach a doctor due to the tedious travels they would have to undertake. “We have to travel to Barwani, Indore or Dhar even if some minor health problems develop. There is not a single female doctor here. Most of the women don’t go to the doctors as they don’t want to travel such long distance and this affects their health adversely. They go to the other districts for treatment only when the condition becomes very serious,” said Anita Devi, 55, who had to travel to Indore from Gandhwani when she had suffered urinary tract infection (UTI) a few months ago. Bhanwari Bai, another resident of the area, claimed that the pregnant women always ensured travel arrangements in advance of their delivery date. “There is a dearth of female doctors in the entire district. Though we have at least one female doctor in Manawar and Kukshi, the one who was posted in Gandhwani resigned a year ago. After that, the post has been lying vacant. We had sent a letter to the government asking for a doctor in Gandhwani and are hoping that it may get filled soon,” said R C Panika, chief medical officer, Dhar. He added that female doctors are not interested to serve in remote areas like Gandhwani due to lack of facilities here. They prefer districts and towns as compared to tribal areas. Gynaecologist Dr Monika Chouhan who is posted in Manawar, claimed, “Because of the dearth of female doctors, we get burdened with cases from these areas. We get hundreds of referrals from Umarband, Gandhwani and Bakaner every day for which we have to work extra hours.” This is primarily because female doctors prefer to work in urban areas. Since Chouhan is from Manawar, it was not difficult for her to adjust there. According to her, the main reason why no female doctor is ready to come to Gandhwani is because of it is located in a very remote place. The situation is similar in the Kukshi Assembly constituency which belongs to the Congress. There is only one female doctor in this constituency. In the absence of advance health care facilities, patients have to be referred to other districts. Congress legislator from Kukshi, Surendra Singh Baghel, claimed that a few months before the 2013 Assembly polls, Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced the construction of a civil hospital in Kukshi. However, the hospital is yet to become a reality even after five years. “As soon as I became the MLA from this constituency in 2013, the construction of the hospital was put on the back burner,” he alleged. “The civil hospital building is almost ready but it will take time to start. We also don't have any doctor of medicine (MD) here which is a big problem,” Dr Devda said. Baghel claimed that only improving the infrastructure in the area would not help the constituency, unless doctors are ready to work in such areas. However, Dr Raj Barfa, BJP president in Dhar, claims that these are false allegations and a female doctor has been working in Kukshi for several years. “The CHC in Kukshi has been given the status of a civil hospital, which is in its completion stage. The civil hospital will have 90 beds and advanced machinery needed for treatment. Gandhwani doesn’t have a female doctor because she was transferred recently,” he said. In Jhabua and Alirajpur districts as well, women constitute over 49 percent of voters and issues concerned with the fairer sex are likely to emerge as one of the rallying points in upcoming polls. While districts have many pressing issues regarding health, hygiene and nutrition, safety of women and liquor ban are being discussed increasingly with polls drawing closer.",2018-11-09,"BJP,Congress,Dhar District,Gandhwani,Gandhwani Assembly Constituency,Indore,Kukshi CHC,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Manawar,PoliticalPlay,Ranjana Baghel","In Madhya Pradesh's Gandhwani, people await female doctors, health infrastructure; Opposition blames BJP for bias",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/in-madhya-pradeshs-gandhwani-people-await-female-doctors-health-infrastructure-opposition-blames-bjp-for-bias-5526291.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"  Firstpost. According to data released by pollster C-Voter, the Congress has a clear advantage in the upcoming Rajasthan Assembly election on 7 December, with Sachin Pilot enjoying a favourable rating compared to incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of the BJP. The Congress' projected lead in the vote share over the BJP—47.9 to 39.7 percent—easily exceeds the margin of error, thereby reducing the likelihood of a verdict against the run of play in the contest for 200 Assembly seats, as per analysis done by C-Voter for   and  . As the BJP's fortunes have experienced a late surge between August and November 2018, the projected vote share gap between the Congress and BJP has reduced from 14 percent in August to eight percent. Taking into account the fact that the distribution of tickets has ended and last minute micro-management is in place, vote share trends may not differ substantially from here on, according to C-Voter. A disjointed BJP is unlikely to whittle down a Congress lead of 8 percent in the projected vote share, according to the pollster.  Congress is leading comfortably in the projected vote share in all five of Rajasthan's regions as per the C-Voter data. Congress is dominating the BJP comfortably in Dhundhar and Harouti, and has less than five percent lead in projected vote share only in Marwad and Mewar. This is indicative of a uniform anti-incumbency mood across the state with no pocket of BJP influence shining through in the polls, according to the pollster. The C-Voter poll predicted that the Congress will net 145 seats and the BJP will win only 55 seats in the 2018 Assembly election. In 2013,  the Congress won a mere 21 seats and the BJP won a whopping 163 seats. Congress' Sachin Pilot garnered 38.7 percent of votes from those polled and emerged by far the most popular candidate for the post of chief minister. Incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of the BJP is a distant second with 22.7 percent respondents saying she would be the best candidate, followed closely by Congress' Ashok Gehlot, who got the nod from 20.5 percent of respondents. When respondents were specifically asked to choose between Pilot and Raje, Pilot emerged as most voters' preferred candidate: 50.6 percent of respondents picked Pilot, while only 31.9 percent picked Raje. C-Voter concluded that the Rajasthan Congress seems to be managing its affairs well by presenting a united face, that the BJP incumbent chief minister and the state government seem equally unpopular, that the BJP isn't in the hunt in any of Rajasthan's regions, that the gap in the projected vote share between BJP and Congress is too wide to be bridged by a late surge and that ticket distribution and micro-management have not been impacted much by projections. The CNX poll gives the BJP a projected 43.5 percent vote share and the Congress a 40.3 percent vote share.  The CSDS poll gave the Congress a projected 45 percent vote share and the BJP a 41 percent vote share. The CFORE poll gave the Congress a 50 percent vote share and the BJP a 43 percent vote share. The CNX poll predicts the BJP will win  75 seats and the Congress will net 115 seats.  The CSDS poll predicts 110 seats for the Congress and 84 seats for the BJP. The CFORE poll estimates 130 seats for the Congress and 65 seats for the BJP.",2018-11-15,"Agriculture,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,C-Voter Survey,Congress,Health Care,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Women And Child Development",Rajasthan polls: C-Voter gives Congress clear advantage over 'disjointed' BJP ahead of 7 December election,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-cvoter-gives-congress-clear-advantage-over-disjointed-bjp-ahead-of-7-december-election-5526541.html,firstpost,-1,0

The Congress is on the verge of losing its last remaining government in the North East, according to CVoter analysis done for   and  According to the pollster, this development is significant for the grand old party considering Mizoram's favourable demographic profile. CVoter predicts that the Congress will win only 12 seats (compared to 34 in 2013), the MNF (Mizo National Front) will win 17 seats (up from five in 2013 ) and the ZPM will win 9 seats (up from one in 2013). 
 
 The data shows a highly-competitive three-way race between the Congress, MNF, and Zoram People's Movement (ZPM). The MNF, which is projected to garner 33.1 percent of the vote share, is leading the Congress, which is estimated to win 29.4 percent of the vote share. The ZPM is nipping at the Congress' heels, with a projected 27.4 percent vote share. This is a massive change compared to the 2013 Assembly election where the Congress under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla (who has been in power since 2008) won 44.6 percent of the vote share, and the MNF and ZPM won 28.7 percent and 23.6 percent respectively.

Press Trust of India,": As a pitched political battle unfolds between the ruling BJP and its main challenger Congress in Chhattisgarh, another war is literally on display between the Naxals and the election authorities on walls and hoardings across the state's Naxal-hit areas. At some places, the huge banners put out by the Election Commission asking people to celebrate 'vote pandum', which in local Gondi language means 'festival of vote', actually outnumber and outsize the posters of various political parties too. Besides, many polling booths are being decorated like temples. Officials said the posters have been put up to counter the Naxal propaganda asking people not to vote. The interiors of Dantewada and Sukma regions, which have been among the epicentres of Naxalism in the state, are full of posters put up by Naxals asking villagers to boycott the elections. As part of efforts to increase voting, the administration and electoral officers are also offering goodies to people, including to local women self-help groups who have been promised waiver of five percent of their debts for bringing physically disabled persons and voters in the periphery of the Naxal-affected areas to polling booths. The poll panel is also planning to paint and colour all 232 polling stations in Sukma, considered a sensitive area, like a temple, its District Collector Amit Kumar Maurya said. ""There are 40 polling stations in the district which will be shifted by either helicopter, or by cycle or by foot and in the similar way agents will go to these booths,"" he said. To reach some of these stations, the poll agents will even have to cross a river. During last assembly elections, 42 polling booths saw 0-10 percent voting but the administration is trying to make voting day a festival this time, he said. ""The administration wants to make the villagers feel that they are not coming to polling booth but to a temple to celebrate a festival. We are also fighting a war for the sake of democracy,"" Maurya told  . He is hopeful that polling will cross 65 percent this time in the district, compared to 48 percent in 2013 assembly polls. Dantewada, another Naxal-affected area and an adjoining district to Sukma, has gone one step further and has set up three pooling stations in the hyper-sensitive Naxal area, which will witness voting for the first time in last 20 years. ""Telam, Tetam and Gautse — these are three polling stations, which will witness voting for the first time in last 20 years,"" Dantewada District Collector Sourav Kumar told  . He said the district administration organized a special contest among kids in the day-boarding schools on the periphery of the Naxal-affected area, to write a letter to their parents asking them to vote. On steps being taken to motivate voters in the Naxal-affected areas and for physically disabled persons, Kumar said they have roped in women self-help groups for this. ""The administration will waive five percent of their debt, if their performance would be satisfactory,"" Kumar said. These groups have a huge network in this region and can be of great help to us, he added. Dantewada had recorded more than 62 percent voting in last assembly elections in 2013. There are 273 polling stations in Dantewada, of which 31 are ""normal"" and 137 ""hyper sensitive"". The rest are ""sensitive"". Talking about security scenario in the region, Dantewada SP Abhishek Pallav said adequate force has been deployed and all polling agents will be accompanied by the security personnel, comprising both local police force and CRPF. He said the biggest threat is from IEDs, spikes and pressure bombs, which are at times hard to detect, but the entire polling booth areas are being sanitised. Voting in this region will take place on 12 November in the first phase of the state assembly elections. There are a total of 12 seats in the Bastar region — Bijapur, Dantewara, Konta, Chitrakot, Bastar, Narainpur, Kondagaon, Keshkal, Kanker, Bhanupratappur, Antagarh and Jagdalpur. Of them, eight are held by the Congress and the rest by the BJP. This region has been witness to some of the deadliest Maoist attacks in the country over several years, and some recent attacks in the run-up to the election, including one in which two policemen and a photo journalist were killed and several injured, again brought the issue of Naxalism back to headlines. Polling for the 90-seat Chhattisgarh Assembly is scheduled to be held in two phases - first on 12 November for 18 seats and on November 20 for 72 constituencies. Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, who is seeking mandate for a record fourth time, is contesting from Rajnandgaon constituency where polling will be held in the first phase.

Press Trust of India," Seat-sharing deal among partners of the Congress-led grand alliance for the 7 December Assembly elections in Telangana has been finalised, a key AICC functionary said Thursday. The AICC in-charge of Telangana affairs, RC Khuntia, said, ""Seat-sharing has been finalised. It will be announced after its approval by Congress president Rahul Gandhi."" This ends weeks of negotiations that the Congress had with its electoral partners — the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and the Communist Party of India (CPI). Khuntia did not say how many seats the Congress would contest in the polls for the 119-member Assembly, but party sources indicated that it would not be less than 90. A TDP leader claimed that his party may get 14 to 18 seats. The founder-president of TJS, M Kodandaram said the Congress has offered his party eight to ten seats, whereas he is seeking a minimum of 12 but expressed hope that the issue would be settled. ""Some adjustment has to happen but we are more worried about the delay (in finalising the seat-sharing formula). Delay is the major issue,"" he said. The CPI has been offered three seats.

FP Staff,"With the first phase of the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections days away, the battlefield is set and campaigning by political parties is on in full swing. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking to win its fourth term, while the Congress is aiming to dethrone Chief Minister Raman Singh's government. Polling will be held in two phases in Maoist-affected Chhattisgarh. In the first phase on 12 November, voting will be held in 18 constituencies in the southern part of the state and in 72 constituencies in the second phase on 20 November. Of the 90 Assembly segments in Chhattisgarh, 51 are general, while 10 are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Caste (SC) communities and 29 from Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities. Here are some of the key constituencies of the 90-seat House: Bilaspur is a high-profile seat as it seen as a BJP stronghold. It is a commercial hub with large railway settlements, as it houses the headquarters of both the South East Central Railway Zone and South Eastern Coalfields Limited. Shailesh Pandey of the Congress will face sitting MLA and Chhattisgarh Minister of Urban Development Amar Agrawal in Bilaspur. The Congress' Bilaspur unit spokesperson, Abhay Narayan Rai, protested in front of the party office after Pandey's candidacy was announced, alleging that Pandey was an outsider. The Dantewada constituency is infamous for encounters between the Naxals and security personnel. The Congress fielded sitting MLA Devati Karma, the wife of Congress stalwart Mahendra Karma who was killed in a Naxal attack on 24 May, 2013, for the second time. In the 2013 Assembly elections, the NOTA (none of the above) share from Dantewada was higher than the winning margin. Devati had defeated her BJP rival Bhima Mandavi, but  . The Dantewada constituency is also a reserved ST seat. Rich in natural resources and also affected by Naxal violence, Kanker district has three Assembly constituencies, all of which are reserved for candidates from ST communities. The Congress has fielded former president of Adivasi Congress Sishupal Sori. The former IAS officer hails from this region, and the party gave him a ticket bypassing sitting MLA Shanker Dhurv. Rebels in this Naxal-hit constituency in Chhattisgarh have   in the polls. The Bastar Assembly constituency is also an ST seat. Of the 18 seats that go to the polls in Chhattisgarh in the first phase, 12 are in the Bastar region. Bastar will be closely-watched to see whether the BJP can recover the seats it lost to the Congress in 2013 — the Congress had won eight of the region's 12 seats in the last elections. Healthcare is a major concern in this tribal dominated region. Besides the 12 Naxal-affected constituencies in the Bastar division, the other six Maoist-hit constituencies that go to the polls on 12 November are in Rajnandagoan district. The Congress has fielded former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla as its candidate against Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh for the Rajnandgaon seat. Although Shukla is a vocal BJP critic, Singh has a good hold over Rajnandgaon, his hometown. He made his Lok Sabha debut from Rajnandgaon in 1999 after defeating Congress leader Motilal Vohra. During campaigning for the elections, the chief minister assured voters he would turn Rajnandgaon into a ""Smart City"" and ""get prosperity back"" in the region. Located in the Durg district of Chhattisgarh and officially known as Bhilai Nagar, the city is known for its steel and chemical industry, notably the Bhilai Steel Plant. Bhilai Nagar is the stronghold of the Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha (CMM), which was founded by labour leader Shankar Guha Niyogi in 1986 to fight for the rights of miners and factory workers in Bhilai's Dilla Rajhara, where the Bhilai Steel Plant's captive mines are located. Bhilai has been the   on labour issues between activists and the Chhattisgarh government for years. Lawyer activist   for several decades and enjoys support from this city. With her arrest by the BJP-ruled Centre in August, Bhilai will be a constituency to watch. The Congress fielded Bhilai municipal corporation mayor and youth leader Devendra Yadav against state minister and sitting BJP MLA Premprakash Pandey. Raigarh is a city and municipal corporation in Chhattisgarh's Raigarh district. The constituency is also an ST seat. Parts of Raigarh face the issue of man-elephant conflict, and remote villages of Raigarh face rail and road connectivity issues. The state had come up with the East Rail Corridor Phase-I project, the implementation of which aims to  . In 2017, the state government had taken up   for roads measuring 586 kilometres and spread over Raigarh, Surguja, Korba and Jashpur districts, which face road connectivity issues.

In 2013, Deo repeated his win against Dev by a huge margin of 19,558 votes.  , Deo was made the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly. Ambikapur has witnessed   Pvt Ltd over issues of proper compensation, rehabilitation and jobs because of the land acquisitions the company undertook for mining. Both these constituencies are urban power centres. The Congress fielded Kanhaiya Agrawal, a new face, from Raipur City South against sitting BJP MLA and minister Brijmohan Agrawal. Supporters of Congress leader Ejaz Dhebar, who was seeking a ticket from the Raipur City South constituency, vandalised the party office after Dhebar was not named a candidate. The BJP  fielded minister Rajesh Munat from Raipur City West, and Vikas Upadhyaya from the Congress will contest against him. Rekhchand Jain from the Congress will contest from Jagdalpur, whereas sitting MLA Santosh Bafna has been given a BJP ticket. Located in the tribal-dominated Bastar district, Jagdalpur was the focus of the Centre's Bastar development plan, for which the Jagdalpur airport was touted to solve the region's development and medical emergency woes. But months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Jagdalpur airport,  . It is a widely believed myth that the party that wins from this constituency forms the government in Chhattisgarh. Congress leader   will contest the Assembly polls from Korba. The BJP has fielded Vikas Mahto, son of party leader Banshilal Mahto, from the Korba Assembly seat, considered a Congress bastion. Korba is also a battleground for anti-mining groups. Village councils that had opposed mining in the district have complained that two to three years of   in the region. Moreover, the thickly forested northern Chhattisgarh region, comprising the districts of Surguja, Korba, Raigarh and Jashpur, is notorious for incidents of human-elephant conflict. In the past few years, wild elephants have killed several people and damaged houses and crops in the region. An ST seat, the Marwahi constituency has come under the spotlight as   will contest the polls from this seat.

Sanjay Singh,"A series of events and announcements made by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during his two-day stay in Ayodhya for   clearly indicates that he is offering a mix of Hindutva and development to keep the Ram temple issue alive among the people. The chief minister chose the timing of the declaration on the eve of Diwali to send his message to people in Uttar Pradesh as well as outside. Interestingly, on the first day of the Deepotsav, he neither made any announcement about his plans to build a Ram statue nor did he utter a word on the Ram Temple. At this event, Kim Jung-sook, the First Lady of South Korea, was the chief guest. Besides this, it was an occasion on which three lakh   were lit on the banks of the river Saryu, creating a world record. Sources in the Uttar Pradesh government said that Adityanath did so because of two reasons. The first reason was that he did not want to divert public attention from the Deepotsav. Second, even as he was participating in various functions at different locations in Ayodhya, several officials in Ayodhya and Lucknow were working on the construction plan of the Ram statue. The chief minister changed his tone on the second day of the Deepotsav. After a   of Ram Lalla at the disputed high-security Ram Janmabhoomi site, flanked by seers  Adityanath listed a number of development works that his government has planned for Ayodhya. But two things which he said resonated with many people in Uttar Pradesh as well as outside the state — the promise to build a grand statue of Ram on the banks of the river Saryu, and the assertion, “  (The temple was there, is there and will always be there)”. It is a fact that people have been making limited religious offerings to Ram Lalla since the statue was installed on 22 December, 1949 inside the premises of the Babri Masjid. Further, after the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December, 1992, a makeshift temple was built at the disputed site. A priest regularly offers   there. There are many who believe that irrespective of the nature of the Supreme Court’s order, it is impossible for any government to demolish the “de-facto temple” and remove the Ram Lalla statue from its current location. On the subject of the construction of a temple at the disputed site, Adityanath reiterated his party’s pledge and said that the resolution of the issue would be found within the existing constitutional framework. Nevertheless, he will have to answer queries from a large number of temple protagonists and sympathisers. The section of the populace which Adityanath was trying to address in response to a query from the media forms the core of the BJP’s social support base. The Uttar Pradesh government had approached the Supreme Court with a prayer for early hearing in the title suit case. Till the time some tangible move is made with regard to the temple construction (unlikely in near future), Adityanath has found a way to keep the people's sentiments alive and the Ayodhya pot boiling by using other measures. Faizabad district is now Ayodhya, and Ayodhya town now has a municipal corporation. A large number of projects for the development of infrastructure and tourism have been initiated for the town. Adityanath has now officially announced his intentions to build a statute of Ram on the banks of the Saryu river. The government has shortlisted three sites for the purpose. Though the chief minister didn’t say anything about the height of the statue, sources in the state administration told   that it would be 108 metres high. The number 108 has special significance in Hindu mythology. There was a dispute about the height of the statue and it seems the government has finalised it at 108 metres. It is said that the statue of Lord Ram would be in the posture of a warrior. The base will be about 50 metres high. It will house a museum narrating the importance of Ayodhya, a chronicle on Lord Ram's Ikshavaku dynasty and highlights from the Ramanaya. The design is said to be the same as that of the newly unveiled Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat. The statue of Ram would undoubtedly serve as a landmark for Ayodhya and further promote tourism, an official said. Six presentations have so far been made by various private players before the state authorities. Sources said that Jaggi Vasudev had made a proposal to the state government to build the statue. He was willing to meet all the expenses and even sent a design of it. But the design was different from the one (warrior Ram) envisaged by the Adityanath government and thus, it was not approved. The chief minister’s office is confident that in a month’s time, everything would be finalised and a formal announcement about the size of the project, exact location and other things would be made. Adityanath wants this huge project to be completed in less than a year, and plans to unveil it on the occasion of Diwali Deepotsav next year.",2018-11-08,"Ayodhya,Babri Masjid,BJP,Deepotsav,Diwali,Faizabad,PoliticalPlay,Ram Janmabhoomi,Ram Temple,Ramlalla,Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev,Sarayu River,Statue Of Ram,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath",Yogi Adityanath’s Deepotsav announcements for Ayodhya aim at keeping Ram temple issue alive among people,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/yogi-adityanaths-deepotsav-announcements-for-ayodhya-aim-at-keeping-ram-temple-issue-alive-among-people-5520311.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rangoli Agrawal,"As the 2018 Assembly elections in Rajasthan inch closer, major political players in the region — especially the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — are making efforts to polish their respective election manifestos. From   in other states to   via a dedicated phone number, the two major political players in the region are using a large part of their resources to draft their manifestos for the 7 December election. However, the ruling BJP faces another challenge of reviewing the unfulfilled promises made in its 2013 election manifesto — which drew the public to vote for the party and grant them 162 out of 200 seats in the 2013 Assembly. As per a report published by Centre for Community Economics and Development Consultants Society (CECOEDECON) in August, one of the major misses of the current state government has been in the area of developing fast track courts for sexual harassment cases. According to the report, the Finance Commission had allotted Rs 214 crore to set up fast track courts in Rajasthan. However, no court has been established yet. “The fast track courts were stalled due to legal issues. We had made appointments but there was no recruitment as there are less judges and advocates. So, the judicial panel was incomplete,” said Suman Sharma, chairperson, Rajasthan Women Commission. “We appointed 35,000 lady constables and set up 56 POCSO courts in Rajasthan, which is a big achievement,” the BJP leader added. The CECOEDECON report further highlighted that the manifesto stated that each Primary Health Centre (PHC) will have one specialist of ‘women-related-diseases’, but this has not been done in all districts. “Though we put out a vacancy of 5,000 doctors, only 1,300 doctors joined, since we wanted specialists,” Sharma said, while explaining the reason. Another area where the government fell short of expectations was formulating a gender-sensitive budget. “The budget for 2015-16 allotted 1.2 percent of the total amount for women-related issues, which came down to 1.02 percent in the following year and finally at 1 percent for 2017-18 budget,” said Barkha Mathur, a contributing writer of the report. The situation in the health sector is also not very appealing. While the Vasundhara Raje-led government had promised to take the state Health Index up to the desired levels as stated in the Millennium Development Goals, it failed to do so in reality. No efforts are being made to take the index to the levels set by the United Nations under Sustainable Development Goals, the report added. When questioned on the party’s performance in the health sector, the BJP state spokesperson Lakshmikant Bhardwaj had an answer ready. “The basic structure needs to be developed in order to improve the overall Health Index. We have worked on that. The idea is to make primary healthcare facilities available to the public at each panchayat. We have given the patients a monetary cover through Bhamashah Bima Yojana so they don’t have to sell their lands to pay for their treatment,” he said. In addition to the above mentioned issues, the 2013 manifesto had also said that if voted to power, the BJP would take steps to ensure quick and efficient treatment of those hurt in road accidents. However, nothing has been announced on that front either. Most importantly, BJP had promised to set up a commission for qualitative improvement of PHCs, Community Health Centres (CHCs), and District Hospitals, and also to rank the hospitals on the basis of overall assessment, awarding the best ones for their performance. The CECOEDECON report revealed that no such commission has been set up so far. “The overall amount spent on National Health Mission (Rural and Urban) in early years is very low in comparison to the budget allotted for the mission,” the report said. According to Rajasthan Economic Review 2017-18, agriculture contributed as much as 24.76 percent of the total GDP of the state in that financial year. However, only 3.5 percent of the overall budget was allocated for the development of this sector. This was less than the previous year’s budget allocation which stood at 4.01 percent. “We have increased the budget for horticulture because we are focusing on diversity and integrated farming. In order to double farmer income by 2022, we are also diverting farmers from traditional crops to diverse crops. We get extra income from various national schemes like national horticulture mission and other missions. The agriculture allocation in the budget definitely needs to increase,” said Prabhulal Saini, state agriculture minister. While comparing the 2013 manifesto to the situation on ground, the CECOEDECON report also stated that though BJP had promised loan waivers in Rajasthan and made several related announcements during its term, no concrete plan has been made for the same. “A committee for the same has been set up which is supposed to ensure loan waiving guidelines,” the report added. When questioned on this, Saini said, “We have transferred the money into their bank accounts. However, the farmers do not understand this and they always want the money in their hands. The loan can only be waived to the account from which it is paid.” Furthermore, no solid steps have been taken so far to formulate an Act for agriculture and related areas which would compile agriculture, animal husbandry, and other farming areas, as promised. Along with this, BJP also failed to keep its promise of setting up a Floriculture Department. “We have laid the foundation of two centres of innovative floriculture, one of which is in Mount Abu and the other in Sawai Madhopur. This was sanctioned about two months back. The overall budget for both centres is Rs 20 crore. The only thing left to work on is integrated farming. We are focusing on that,” Saini said, implying they have not ignored the promise completely. According to the report, other promises which the government failed to deliver upon include promotion of crops requiring less water, fixture of barren lands, and compensation for loss due to animals. Among the promises that saw realisation is promotion of fruits and vegetables in international market, for which a Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet was organised which led to 'Smart Farms' being set up. Health check-ups and vaccinations in schools have happened as promised, efforts are being made to reduce the gap in male-female ratio, several districts have one female police officer posted at the headquarters and more than 50 lakh Bhamashah accounts have been opened. However, the report says that it cannot be confirmed whether the funds have reached the beneficiaries or not.",2018-11-08,"Agriculture,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Health Care,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Women And Child Development",Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018: Forgotten poll promises from 2013 present tough challenge for BJP,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-assembly-election-2018-forgotten-poll-promises-from-2013-present-tough-challenge-for-bjp-5521541.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": The Congress on Thursday night released its sixth and final list for the 28 November Assembly polls in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, nominating its OBC face Arun Yadav against Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Budhni seat in Sehore district. The BJP also announced its fourth and final list of seven candidates for the polls. The Congress left one seat, Jatara, for its ally Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD). With an apparent objective to tie down Chouhan in his bastion Budhni, the Opposition picked up former Union Minister and former MP Congress chief Yadav as his opponent. Yadav's community accounts for a large number of votes, nearly twice that of Kirars, an OBC community to which Chouhan belongs, a source in Sehore district said. Chouhan has been elected from Budhni thrice in a row. ""Yadav will file his nomination papers on Friday,"" party sources said. The Congress left a seat in Jatara, reserved for SC candidate, for LJD in the party's final list. The LJD might field Vikram Choudhary from Jatara, sources said. ""With the final list out, we have declared candidates for 229 out of 230 seats,"" MP Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi said. Budhni, over 60 km from Bhopal, is Chouhan's home turf from where he was first elected as MLA in 1990. This would be the fifth time he will be contesting from the seat, which is close to his ancestral village of Jait in Sehore. In 2013, Chouhan had defeated Congress' Mahendra Singh Chauhan by 84,000 votes from Budhni. Besides Yadav, the Congress, in the final list, announced candidates for Indore-1 (Sanjay Shukla in place of earlier announced Preeti Agnihotri), Indore-2 (Mohan Singh Sengar), Indore-5 (Satyanarayan Patel), Manpur-ST (Gyanwati Singh) and Ratlam Rural-ST (Thavar Lal Bhuria).

Other seats for which it announced candidates were: Pawai (Prahlad Lodhi), Panna (Brijendra Singh), Lakhnadoun-ST (Vijay Uike), Seoni-Malwa (Prem Shankar Verma in place of former minister Sartaj Singh, who quit BJP at the last moment to join Congress in protest), Mahidpur (Bahadur Singh Chauhan) and Garoth (Devilal Dhakar).

Srinivasa Prasad,"Whichever way you look at it, the  Tuesday are bad news for BJP. By-elections were held on 3 November to five seats—three in Lok Sabha and two Assembly seats. Of these, the Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress not only retained the two Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat, but annexed a parliamentary seat of Ballari from BJP. Of five seats that went to by-elections, BJP held two Lok Sabha seats, but retained only Shivamogga with a smaller margin, while losing Ballari by a huge gap. In other words, as far as these by-elections are concerned, the equation of Congress-JD(S) and BJP changed from 3-2 to 4-1. This may not look so terrible on the face of it, but behind this simple scorecard lies a bigger story of disaster for BJP. The enormity of frustration within that party is evident from the laconic comments that came from senior state leader Suresh Kumar even before the results were fully out: An overconfident BJP had almost hoped that the by-elections would mark the beginning of the end of the coalition government of Congress and Janata Dal (Secular). There were indeed questions over whether the coalition, hastily put together after the May Assembly elections, would be able to fight the coming Lok Sabha poll together. The conduct of the leaders of the two parties after they formed the government only confirmed the doubts over whether the post-poll coalition formed after the Assembly election can be an effective pre-poll alliance for the Lok Sabha poll, considering the differences within—and between—Congress and JD(S). Whether the coalition can put up a united fight in the Lok Sabha election is still an open question, but the two parties have indeed passed the test of unity at least for now in these by-elections. On the other hand, the results have only thrown up some very vital questions over BJP’s own state of preparedness in Karnataka to face the 2019 election. Clearly, the party needs to do a lot to put its own house in order before picking faults with the coalition. And quite apart from the longevity of the ruling alliance, the question that is already being asked now is: how long will state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa last? For the record, Yeddyurappa may take comfort from the fact that the net loss for BJP is the lone Lok Sabha seat of Ballari. But nobody doubts that the plight of the party is much worse than losing a single seat. The BJP’s candidate in Ballari is J Shantha, the sister of B Sreeramulu, a close associate of the Reddy brothers of the notorious mining mafia. Sreeramulu won the seat for the party in 2014, but caused the vacancy after he resigned following his election to the Assembly in May. Congress candidate VS Ugrappa, an outsider to the constituency who enjoys a clean reputation, won the seat: Though with more than a little help from his party leader DK Shivakumar, better known for his “organisational skills” and his status as one of Karnataka’s richest men. The Ballari result must teach BJP a lesson that Congress repeatedly learnt in the past: money power is not always a foolproof guarantee for election victories. A stronghold of Congress for long, Ballari elected Sonia Gandhi to Lok Sabha in 1999 but has been a BJP turf since 2004. Congress has now wrested it back in circumstances that BJP leaders admit are a shame to their party. Besides, BJP also paid the price for not putting up as united a front in Ballari and the other places as Congress and JD(S) did. Even in Shivamogga, Yeddyurappa had the comfort of seeing his son BS Raghavendra win, but not as easily as expected. This vacancy too was caused by the resignation of Yeddyurappa from the Lok Sabha seat following his election to the Assembly in May. The mess that BJP found itself in in the Ramanagara Assembly constituency was even worse. The victory of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s wife Anita from there was a foregone conclusion, but it became doubly easy after the BJP candidate defected to Congress two days before polling! This led to internal protests within BJP over the unilateral way Yeddyurappa chose the candidate in the first place and fell into a trap, ignoring the advice of some party colleagues. And this once again brings into the open Yeddyurappa’s overbearing style which party men have been complaining about for long. Though powerful sections of the party want nothing less than a change in the state leadership, it’s doubtful if party’s national president Amit Shah will disturb the status quo at least till the 2019 election, considering Yeddyurappa’s clout within his upper-caste Lingayats. Shah’s own lack of comfort with Yeddyurappa is not a secret within the party. But the only thing that Shah may do, as the 2019 polls near, is that he may once again become the de facto state president himself, something he did before the Assembly polls this year. The sample offered by these elections is big enough for BJP to worry about the 2019 outcome, but too small for Congress-JD(S) to gain excessive confidence. The leaders of the two parties indeed put up a show of unity and threw their collective weight behind coalition candidates, but there was no matching enthusiasm from their respective workers on ground zero. Dissatisfaction in Congress over leaving the Mandya and Ramanagara seats to JD(S) was all too clear. And the relatively low turnout of voters in the Lok Sabha constituencies that went to by-elections was attributed to a lack of interest among Congress workers in mobilising voters. And there is no guarantee that the unity of coalition leaders will last long beyond the current successes. A cabinet expansion that is expected soon will be another test of this unity. The victories of the coalition were helped as much by its strength as by the organisational flaws of BJP. That’s what must alarm BJP, known for its organisational finesse and micro-management of elections.",2018-11-06,"Ballari,BS Yeddyurappa,BY Raghavendra,InMyOpinion,Janardhana Reddy,Karnataka By Election Results,Karnataka By Election Results 2018,Karnataka Bypolls,Mandya Bypolls,Ramanagara Bypolls","Karnataka bypoll disaster should force BJP rethink, but Amit Shah unlikely to change status quo ahead of 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/karnataka-bypoll-disaster-should-force-bjp-rethink-but-amit-shah-unlikely-to-change-status-quo-ahead-of-2019-5513271.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ezrela Dalidia Fanai," The Chakmas have been in Mizoram for a long time now. But what is suddenly worrying the Mizos, with Assembly elections slated for 28 November, is the rapid spurt in Chakma population in the areas that fall under the Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC). The Mizos claim this increase is due to illegal immigration from Bangladesh. NGOs across the state have now raised the demand for scrapping of the CADC, with the Young Mizo Association (YMA), the largest of the NGOs, organising mass rallies across the state in October on this issue. These NGOs have also demanded a National Register of Citizens (NRC) be implemented in Mizoram. But their demand that Chakma candidates be denied tickets by the Congress and the BJP has largely been ignored. The mainstream parties, even as they try to steer clear of voicing support for the minorities because of a fear of Mizo backlash, realise that the Chakmas are a strong vote bank, given that they form nearly 10 percent of the total state population of around 11 lakh. They are the second-largest minority group in Mizoram after the Brus. Resentment against the Chakmas in Mizoram is not new. Vanlalruata, president of the Central Young Mizo Association (CYMA), in an interview said that the CADC had been created during the secessionist movement and had happened without a referendum or a commission being set up to go into the issue. “The October rallies were organised based on the decisions made at the general assembly of the CYMA,” said Vanlalruata. “It has been 46 years, and we will approach the court to scrap the CADC. We will also work on the ground to press our demands. After consultation with prominent citizens and retired bureaucrats, and examining Parliament and Assembly records, we will try and prove that some illegalities were involved in the creation of the CADC.” The demand for an NRC stems from rising concerns among Mizo groups that the rapid growth of population within a short span of time in the Chakma council area could easily assimilate the Mizo population. Vanlalruata’s argument on this is that Mizoram is a small state, has a porous border with Bangladesh and Myanmar, has the second-lowest population in India and an extremely low birth rate. He urged mainstream media to give more coverage on the Mizo Chakma issue before “large-scale violence erupts. The rallies held on October 10 mark the stepping stone in preserving the Mizo identity and their rights as citizens of India."" None of the political parties have commented on the NRC demand. Inevitably, NRC is opposed by the Chakmas, who fear being excluded even if they are born in India. Dhana Kumar, secretary, All India Chakma Social Front (AICSF), emphasised that “all Chakmas in Mizoram are Indians"". Johnny Lalthanpuia, co-convener IT and social media for BJP, said that legally settled Chakmas should be integrated into Mizo society but strong action should be taken against foreigners. “The Chakmas themselves do not support the illegal migrants. But fearing the Shanti Bahini (a Bangladeshi insurgent group comprising mostly Chakmas), they often do not voice their opinion regarding this.” The presence of Chakmas in Mizoram can be traced back to 1871 when the Chakma queen Kalindi Rani provided 500 Chakma coolies to the British army who were fighting the Lushai (Mizo) chiefs in the Chittagong Hill tracts. This led to a small portion of land in these hill tracts, along with its inhabitants, becoming part of the Lushai Hills in 1900. But a lot more Chakmas entered the Lushai Hills during the Second World War, under the Labour Transport Corps, and most never returned to Chittagong. The British had made Lushai Hills, which became today’s Mizoram, a district of Assam and used to levy Mizos Rs 2 as hill house tax while the Chakmas paid a tax of Rs 5, the same as foreigners. The question of Chakmas being considered indigenous to Mizoram has been a contentious one among the ethnic Mizos ever since. The Chakmas, calling the demands by the Mizo NGOs unfortunate and a move that can spoil the spirit of peace and brotherhood in the state, argued that the establishment of CADC in 1972 under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution cannot be simply wished away. Suhas Chakma, director of Rights and Analysis Group based in Delhi, argued that the “Mizoram Peace Accord signed by the Mizo National Front with the Government of India provides that the rights and privileges of minorities in Mizoram as envisaged in the Constitution shall be preserved and protected and their social and economic advancement shall be ensured.” These guarantees under the Constitution and the peace accord cannot be abolished, he added. How the protests by the NGOs will play out in the coming elections is not yet clear, but the BJP has already announced it will field two Chakma candidates, one being Buddha Dhan Chakma, a former Congress MLA who recently joined the party. The BJP has also asked its Tripura unit to campaign for Chakma votes in Mizoram. BJP and some regional parties have come together as the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA). On 25 October, two Chakma candidates' names appeared in the final list released by the Congress — sitting MLA Nihar Kanti Chakma from West Tuipui, his home constituency, and newcomer Amit Kumar Chakma from Tuichawng constituency, earlier represented by now BJP’s Buddha Dhan Chakma. But probably in an effort to mollify Mizo voters, party spokesman Professor Maliana criticised ex-Home Minister R Lalzirliana (he had resigned to join the Mizo National Front and was expelled from the Congress) for not making enough effort to deport illegal immigrants during the last ten years. The Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), an alliance forged by seven political parties in the region, have maintained that they will not be fielding any Chakma candidate, completely leaving out the Tuichawng constituency, which is Chakma dominated. On the other hand, the Mizo National Front (MNF), a key regional party in the state, is yet to decide its candidates for the two Chakma dominated constituencies, according to H Rammawi, a former MNF minister.",2018-11-08,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chakma,Congress,India,Mizoram,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Polls,Mizos,PoliticalPlay,Politics","Mizoram polls: Mizos' demand that Chakma candidates be denied tickets gets ignored by Congress, BJP",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-mizos-demand-that-chakma-candidates-be-denied-tickets-gets-ignored-by-congress-bjp-5512391.html,firstpost,-1,0
M Raghuram and Maheshwar Reddy," Counting for by-polls on three Lok Sabha and two Assembly seats were held on Tuesday, and according to final numbers, BJP has been pulverised by the Congress-JD(S) coalition. Out of five constituencies — Jamakhandi, Ballari, Mandya, Ramanagara and Shivamogga — the BJP managed a win only in the Lok Sabha constituency of Shivamogga. There are several factors in play as to what went wrong for the BJP, and how the Congress and JD(S) swept four constituencies. Ground zero indicators suggest that it was the magic woven together by the unified coalition, by sticking together, while BJP’s leadership in the state pushed their preferred candidates that determined who won and who lost. Two classic examples, Shivamogga Lok Sabha constituency and Ballari Assembly constituency, can be analysed. Former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, who had led the BJP campaign across the state in the last Assembly polls, concentrated only on Shivamogga where his son BY Raghavendra had contested. On the other hand, JD(S) had an understanding with the Congress and fielded Madhu Bangarappa, son of late S Bangarappa, another former chief minister of the state. It was clearly a fight between the the veteran politicians’ sons. Though victory was achieved by BJP’s BY Raghavendra, the winning margin of just 52,148 votes, was not as expected -- Raghavendra secured 5,43,306 votes while Madhu Bangarappa secured 4,91,158 votes. JDU’s Mahima Patel, son of former chief minister JH Patel got 8,713 votes, while Shashidhar Gowda, an independent candidate received 17,189 votes. In Ballari, Sriramulu’s insisting that his sister, Shanta, be given the chance to contest did not go down well with the people, who have been witness to the sharing of power among siblings previously as well in the case of Reddy brothers -- Somashekar, Janardhan and Karunakar. Sriramulu was an associate of the Reddys who have been rooted in the mining business. The huge margin with which Congress’ VS Ugrappa defeated BJP’s J Shanta in Ballari is evident of the mood of the electorate who had had enough of the siblings’ rule. In a victory that could well classify as ‘historic’, Uggrappa defeated Shanta by a margin of 2,14,826 votes, securing 5,54,139 votes and stopping Shanta at 3,39,313 votes. This is the largest vote margin by far that any Congress candidate has won in Ballari. The BJP had seen too much power in Sriramulu. Despite the party winning only 15 of the 35 seats entrusted to him in North Karnataka region during 2018 elections, his image as an electoral superman did not take a hit. Going into the bypoll, the nominated candidate, his sister Shanta, was an example of Sriramulu’s authority. However, the people seem to have decided against his choice. The success of JD(S) candidates in Mandya and Ramanagara had been considered as a foregone conclusion much before the polling in these constituencies. All these years, Congress was considered as their primary rival in both Mandya and Ramanagara. With Congress extending their support to the regional party and BJP fielding candidates carelessly, there was no stopping JD(S) from dominating the polls in this south Karnataka region. Though several Congress workers found it tough to campaign for JD(S) candidate Anitha Kumaraswamy in Ramanagara, senior leaders such as DK Suresh and DK Shivakumar played a key role in ensuring victory through their allies. BJP members alleged that Bangalore Rural MP, DK Suresh, was instrumental in the withdrawal of BJP candidate L Chandrashekhar from the contest on Ramanagara seat in support of Anitha Kumaraswamy. It is surprising though that despite pulling out of the race, the BJP candidate secured 15,906 votes. While Anitha’s sweeping victory has ensured that Ramanagara remains a JD(S) stronghold, if some inside sources in the JD(S) are to be believed, the masterstroke was engineered by party chief HD Deve Gowda. In Mandya, the success of JD(S) candidate L Shivarame Gowda, was a predictable conclusion. With Congress agreeing not to field its candidate and BJP selecting not-so-popular Dr Siddaramaiah, JD(S) succeeded in retaining the seat that was vacated by C Puttaraju, after he was elected to the Karnataka State Assembly as a minister in the HD Kumaraswamy cabinet. The other reason for BJP’s embarrassment in Ramanagara is the lack of coordination among its top leaders. Apart from former Union minister DV Sadananda Gowda, no other BJP leader evinced interest in campaigning in Ramanagara. It is also a known fact that the BJP leadership has no wherewithal to compete against the Congress or JD(S) in Ramanagara since it is yet to strengthen its cadre there. The BJP leadership is heavily dependent on CP Yogeshwar who was defeated in Channapatna Assembly by JD(S) candidate HD Kumaraswamy. In Jamkhandi, it was expected that Anand Nyamegouda would ride the sympathy wave to some extent in his first run at an Assembly seat. Anand’s father, Siddu Nyamegouda, is credited with developing Bagalkot from an agricultural district to a hub of horticulture, industrial tourism and transport services. He had died in a road mishap soon after the 2018 elections. Anand Nyamegouda polled 97,017 votes against his BJP competitor Shrikanth Kulkarni, who polled 57,537 votes, winning by a margin of 39,480 votes. Despite the fact that voting average was at 68.5 percent across all five constituencies, the margins by which the victors won, is something to reckon with.

Sanjay Singh,"The ghats on the banks of River Saryu in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, never looked as beautiful as they did on Tuesday, the eve of Diwali. Besides the festive mood among those gathered, the grandeur of the Yogi Adityanath government's programme, including performances by national and international artistes, ""Lord Ram and Sita"" arriving in a helicopter, laser and water shows, and finally the lighting of over three lakh   on the river bank made it a truly spectacular event. Adityanath has been a prominent votary for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. When he became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in March 2017 with a three-fourth majority in the Assembly, there was great deal of expectation among sympathisers that things would finally move forward on the Ayodhya front. He continues to be the mahant of the Gorakhnath Peeth, the first and only in Indian history to be a serving mahant of the religious sect as well as a chief minister of the state. Two of his predecessors, Mahant Avaidyanath and Mahant Digvijaynath, have been actively associated with the Ram Janambhoomi movement, from the installation of the statue of Ram Lalla at the disputed site in Ayodhya in 1949 to other movements that culminated to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992 and later events. As Adityanath knows that he and the BJP cannot deliver on the promise they made to people decades ago — "" "" — the construction of the Ram temple remains a distant dream. He understood that he can't maintain a ""neutral"" position on Ayodhya, a place that he had been frequenting both as a religious leader as well as a political leader in his formative years. As chief minister, he couldn't say anything that could be termed an irresponsible statement, and he couldn't move an inch on the construction of the temple because the matter is pending in Supreme Court. Adityanath, therefore, opted for the second-best option that serves him well both as an administrator and as a leader BJP leader in the state — keep organising events in and around Ayodhya to keep the popular sentiment alive and ensure that his sincerity is never questioned. His move to hold grand Diwali celebrations in Ayodhya last year was a step in this direction. He made the move last year, but the   this year caught the attention of the nation. The planning made headlines, and the event was telecast live on all mainstream news channels. Thousands of people from across the nation visited Ayodhya to be part of the event. South Korean First Lady Kim Jung-sook was invited to be the chief guest of the event to give an international flavor to the celebrations and give an impression that this was not just a Hindu religious festival. At the Ayodhya event on Tuesday, the First Lady of South Korea laid the foundation stone for a Rs 50-core monument in the name of ancient era South Korean Queen Heo Hwang-ok — known in India as Suriratna — who is said to originally be from Ayodhya. A sense of satisfaction was clearly visible on Adityanath's face. He had achieved what he had aspired for in the immediate term — bring Ayodhya back in the national discourse, leave a positive impression about developmental and spiritual work and project himself as the one doing his best to fulfil the commitment towards building the temple. If the construction of the Ram temple is dependent on the outcome of the Supreme Court verdict, then Adityanath will build a statue of Ram, and develop and beautify ghats on the banks of River Saryu, and develop the right infrastructure in the town. So far, Ayodhya did not have any decent place to accommodate pilgrims and tourists. But now, Ayodhya has a municipality to take care of its civic needs — roads, water, sewer, street lights and other such basic necessities — and there are a host of other plans for electricity and infrastructure work, as well. Adityanath has an advantage. Unlike most of his predecessors in the chief minister's office, he is not afraid of talking about Ayodhya. He does not need to be apologetic about anything related to Ayodhya. He knows that some visible work in Ayodhya that has larger public approval could work to his advantage as well as for the BJP in the 2019 elections. The Ayodhya dispute has been a hugely emotive issue for millions of Hindus in Uttar Pradesh and the rest of the country. Adityanath is trying to appear sincere about the Ram temple and Ayodhya, even if he and his party can't deliver on their promise to construct the temple. By doing what he did in Ayodhya — celebrating Diwali by inviting the South Korean First Lade — he has won half his battle.",2018-11-06,"Ayodhya,Ayodhya Diwali Celebration,ConnectTheDots,Diwali In Ayodhya,Kim Jung-Sook,Ram Temple,South Korean First Lady,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath","Yogi Adityanath is doing what's best for him, BJP: Developing Ayodhya, organising events to keep popular sentiment alive",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/yogi-adityanath-is-doing-whats-best-for-him-bjp-developing-ayodhya-organising-events-to-keep-popular-sentiment-alive-5512691.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The BJP on Tuesday released its list of 40 star campaigners for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly election and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj are some of the top leaders who will stump for BJP candidates. The ruling party has, so far, announced 194 candidates for Madhya Pradesh, which has a total of 230 Assembly seats. The first list for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls was released on 2 November. The second list was released Monday in New Delhi by Union minister JP Nadda, who is also secretary of the BJP's Central Election Committee. Lok Sabha member Anoop Mishra, nephew of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was named in the list and five sitting MLAs were dropped. Mishra, the Lok Sabha MP from Morena, will contest from Bhitarwar in Gwalior district. He unsuccessfully fought the 2013 Assembly polls from the same constituency. The party has renominated eight other MLAs including Minister of State for Health Sharad Jain, who will contest from Jabalpur North seat. There are also two women candidates. Nirmala Bhuriya, daughter of former MP and tribal leader Dilip Singh Bhuriya, will contest from Petlawad in Jhabua district. In 2015, she lost the bypoll from Jhabua-Ratlam Lok Sabha constituency, which fell vacant following the death of her father.

Press Trust of India," The BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress and the JD(S) of using money and muscle power to win the bypolls in Karnataka, but said it would introspect the outcome and strengthen the party before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. ""The truth of the matter is that money and liquor had a bigger role in this election. Congress and JD(S) won the election using money and power,"" BJP state unit president BS Yeddyurappa said. The BJP won the Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat but lost Ballari to the Congress, which also bagged the Jamkhandi Assembly segment.

Debobrat Ghose,"The JD(S)-Congress alliance in Karnataka was expected to be a fragile one, not supposed to last till the crucial 2019 general election. At least, the BJP camp believed so firmly. Former chief minister Siddaramaiah's constant quibbling with current Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy only reaffirmed that line of thinking. The performance of the JD(S)-Congress alliance in the Karnataka bypolls, however, has doused any hope of the alliance falling apart in a hurry. In the elections held for three Lok Sabha and two Assembly constituencies, the JD(S)-Congress alliance scored significant victories. It will act as a booster for the Congress as well as the JD(S) in their attempt to form a ‘ ’ (grand alliance) ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha election. While out of total five seats (both Lok Sabha and Assembly), the JD(S) and the Congress have won four, the BJP managed to win only one. Of the three Lok Sabha seats, the Congress candidate VS Urgappa has won Ballari and the JD(S) candidate L Shivarame Gowda has won Mandya. The sole winner from the BJP, BY Raghavendra, has won the Shivamogga seat by defeating his JD(S) rival Madhu Bangarappa. Of the two Assembly seats, JD(S) candidate Anitha Kumaraswamy, wife of Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, has won Ramanagara and Congress’ Anand Nyamagouda has won Jamnakhandi. When the two parties joined hands post the 2018 Karnataka Assembly election to keep BJP out of power in the state, it was spoken of like an alliance of top leaders in either party, not a meeting of minds of the grassroots level workers of both. Experts said that the rivalry among followers of the two parties was so strong that the transfer of Congress votes to the JD(S) candidate and vice versa was impossible. The latest results don't reflect it. It can only mean bad news for the BJP. The performance in stronghold Ballari, a seat the party has held since 2004, is a cause for worry in particular. As the trends became clear, HD Kumaraswamy, while congratulating Congress and JD(S) leaders, said, “BJP calls JD(S)-Congress coalition  . Today that contention has been nullified. These elections were the first step that JD(S) would work with Congress on all the Lok Sabha seats to win all of them. That’s our goal. This is not an empty boast just because we have won today. This is the confidence of people in us. This win is not making us arrogant.” While, the former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has termed bypolls victory as Karnataka’s Diwali gift to Congress and JD(S), former finance minister and senior Congress leader, P Chidambaram has compared the JD(S)-Congress alliance victory with that of a cricket test match series under the captaincy of Virat Kohli. ""The by-elections are considered as important (element) for the coalition government, and this success in by-elections is the success of coalition government,” remarked Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president, Dinesh Gundu Rao. The result also confirms the trend that if opposition parties form an alliance then the BJP finds itself on a weaker wicket. The message from Karnataka is certain to give the talks of a secular grand alliance for 2019 polls a boost. Such an alliance in several bypolls, including in Uttar Pradesh, has put the saffron party on a losing streak over the last couple of years.

Press Trust of India," The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday termed the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to rename Faizabad district as Ayodhya as ""Tughlaqi"" (autocratic) and said it should have taken people's opinion. The   was announced by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath earlier on Tuesday. The decision comes close on the heels of the state's BJP-led government renaming Allahabad as Prayagraj.

Parth MN,"Deepak Baij believes it was a steel plant which played a crucial role in him entering the Chhattisgarh Assembly in 2013. And he is confident it is the same plant that would ensure he remains there in 2018. Tata Steel signed a memorandum of understanding with the Raman Singh-led Chhattisgarh government in 2005 to set up a Rs 19,500 crore plant in the tribal district of Bastar. It involved acquiring 5,000 acres of land across 10 villages for the plant that proposed to create 5.5 million tonnes of steel per annum. The state started acquiring land 2008-09 onwards. It met with severe resistance from the 1,700-odd affected tribal families. In 2009, residents of Bedanji village submitted a letter to the collector of Jadgalpur which said, ""We will not move"". The same year in June, Maoists shot Vimal Meshram, an influential tribal leader and a vocal supporter of the project, at a busy market in broad daylight. Tata backed out of the project in 2016, citing unfavourable law and order situation. Baij, who contested the 2013 Assembly elections on a Congress ticket, says he mobilised the protesters and campaigned against the project democratically. ""The voters believed I had their best interests in mind,"" he adds. However, even though the project has not taken off, the land acquired from Adivasi farmers have not been returned to them. ""I have promised them they will get their land back within months,” says Baij, sitting MLA from the Chitrakoot Assembly constituency in which the land was acquired in the block of Lohandiguda. “According to the rule, if the project does not take off within five years of land acquisition, the land is supposed to be returned to the original owner."" His counterpart from the BJP, Lachchu Ram Kashyap, has taken a pro-industry stand, saying if he were elected, he would bring in industries that would lead to job creation and development. The affected villages do not seem to be buying that currently. Kuldhar Nag, a farmer belonging to the Madia tribe in the village of Belar, one of the 10 affected villages, says the administration and officials coerced him to forgo his four-acre land. “The companies wanting to set up projects in our forests should leave us alone,” he says, sitting on a two-wheeler in the verandah of his hut in the densely forested village. “They are only here to exploit us. We were offered compensation, but we don’t want money. We want the right over   (water, forest and land)."" Even though the acquired land is still in the possession of farmers, Nag says he loses out on several government schemes because technically he is not the landowner. ""I cannot sell my paddy harvest at the cooperative society, because the registration mandates land ownership,” he says. “The bank would not give me loan. It is my land, and I don’t want to be at the mercy of others.” Even though the Forest Rights Act and the PESA Act are in place to protect tribal rights, Lawyer and Activist Sudha Bharadwaj had written earlier this year how the “corporate land grab is legitimised in Chhattisgarh by misusing legal framework”. Initially, after the state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000, only the NMDC was involved in those projects. Under the leadership of Raman Singh in the last 15 years, Adivasi land and forests have been opened up for commercial exploitation to the private players, resulting in widespread displacement, measly compensation, and exploitation and pollution of resources. The tribals of Bastar are commonly fighting battles, like the one in Chitrakoot. 
Local observers believe it is probably one of the reasons why the BJP’s vote has steadily shrunk in the division of Bastar, which has 12 seats across seven districts, 11 of them are reserved for Scheduled Tribes. In 2008, the BJP had won 11 out of the 12 seats here, which dramatically came down to 4 in 2013 assembly elections. They go to polls in the first phase on 12 November. The Congress is harping that the state government led by BJP is not concerned about tribals, and is mainly batting for the urban rich. Arvind Netam, a veteran tribal Congress leader and a former union minister, says the BJP has its own definition of development, which does not conform to the tribals. ""BJP has their own mindset,” he says. “We do not like big industries. We care deeply about our roots."" Kashyap, however, says there is a generation gap between the tribals. ""Tribal youth is longing for better opportunities. Industries would create jobs for them,"" he says. Netam disputes the theory of industries bringing in employment opportunities for the youth. ""Look at the Nagar Naar plant,"" he says, giving example of another steal project by NMDC in Bastar. “Everyone that is currently employed is a migrant. Contractors are from outside, the workers are from outside. It has hardly generated local employment.” Youth in the 10 affected villages around Tata plant say they would like better opportunities but do not trust the corporations or the state to have their interests in mind. Karma Mandavi, 26, from Takraguda village, says the likelihood of the projects worsening their lives is far more than the other way round. “They do not follow the norms of basic rehabilitation or compensation,” he says. “When most of the projects forge consent, how do we trust them? It is better to work hard for ourselves on our lands than to be treated like slaves.” Bimla Nag, another resident of Belar, who lost 4 acres of land, slams her forehead as a mark of bad fortune at the mention of Tata plant. ""This project ruined our lives,"" she says, clad in blue sari, sitting on the platform outside her one room hut. ""My father and uncle both participated in the agitations against the project. They passed away, but our land still belongs to the state government.” Upon asked who she would vote for, she says, ""Whoever that saves our land.""",2018-11-08,"Assembly Election 2018,Bastar,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Chitrakoot Assembly,Ground Report,Industrialisation,Tata Steel","As Congress and BJP spar over poll issues, Adivasi farmers of Bastar fight for land acquired for industrialisation 5 years ago",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-election-2018-as-congress-and-bjp-spar-over-poll-issues-adivasi-farmers-of-bastar-fight-for-land-acquired-for-industrialisation-5-years-ago-5518511.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"After the Bharatiya Janata Party embarked on a six-day ""Sabarimala Protection Rath Yatra"" led by Kerala party president PS Sreedharan Pillai, the Congress is set to launch a ""padyatra"" (march) today to protest the Supreme Court verdict. According to  , Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K Sudhakaran will hold the ""Belief Protection Yatra"" from Kasargod from today and end it in Mallapuram on 14 November. Congress will also  launch a series of yatras from Kasaragod, Alapuzha, Thiruvananthapuram, Thodupuzha and Palakkad to ""protect the faith, fight communalism and explain to the people the politicisation"" of the Sabarimala issue by the CPM and saffron parties,   reported. However,   reported that the padyatra will end on 15 November. Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly Ramesh Chennithala was quoted as saying by  : ""The Congress is launching five yatras in Kerala not only on the issue of Sabarimala but other central and state issues. There will be three padyatras and two vehicle yatras. We will cover all constituencies. On the Sabarimala issue, we are with the devotees and their sentiments."" Speaking at the inaugural function of the 'Sabarimala Samrakshana Yatra', former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa sought the immediate intervention of the CPM0-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to end tensions at the hill shrine. The Kerala government should ""apply its mind"" and show seriousness to end the impasse at Sabarimala, he said. ""We are not against the SC verdict. But sentiments of the people should be respected by one and all,"" he added, holding the ruling LDF and Congress-led Opposition UDF responsible for the present impasse. Yeddyurappa flagged off the rath yatra jointly led by BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai and Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) president Tushar Vellapally, from Madhur Siddhi Vinayaka temple in Kasaragod. The rath yatra will conclude at Erumeli near Sabarimala on 13 November, when the Supreme Court is to consider the review petitions against its 28 September verdict permitting women of all age groups to offer prayers at the Lord Ayyappa shrine. Earlier  : ""The Sabarimala Rath Yatra that will begin from Mattur today (Thursday) will reach Sabarimala on 30 November. Our culture has always given prominence to women and treated them with respect. It's all because of the Kerala government and its failure to handle the case before the Supreme Court that the situation has become tense."" ""More than 90 percent of women are protesting against it (the Sabarimala verdict). It is high time the Kerala chief minister takes necessary action and approaches the Supreme Court to stop the entry of women inside the temple. Our party is not opposing the Supreme Court's verdict, but people's emotions should be respected,” the  . At a press conference in Kasargod later Thursday, Yeddyurappa said, ""(Chief Minister) Pinayaryai Vijayan is well aware of the fact that the Kerala High Court, in the 1980s, refused to interfere with the tradition of banning the entry of women between the ages of 10 to 50 inside the temple. Then, the high court had also said that this tradition will not amount to a violation of women's fundamental rights."" Meanwhile, Kerala PCC Working president K Sudhakaran will take out a rally from Kasaragod this evening which will be inaugurated by senior Congress leader MM Hassan. Various Congress leaders will also be leading rallies from different districts in the coming days which will all culminate on 15 November at Pathanamthitta, where the Sabarimala shrine is located. During the yatra, Congress will inform the people how the Sabarimala issue was ""politicised"" by the ruling CPI(M) and BJP, KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran said. BJP-RSS and various other Hindu outfits have been on the warpath against the Left government's decision to implement the apex court verdict. The main Opposition Congress has also made it clear that they were with devotees. The Ayyappa temple opened Monday for the second time in three weeks for a two-day ""Sree Chitira Atta Thirunal"" special puja amid unprecedented security over apprehension of protests by those opposing the Supreme Court order, allowing women of menstrual age.

Henry L Khojol," Thousands of protesters on Tuesday gathered near Chief Election Officer SB Sashank’s office in Aizawl demanding his removal after he accused the Mizoram government of meddling in the upcoming Assembly elections on 28 November. This comes after Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, state Principal Secretary (Home), was removed on Friday, 2 November, by the Election Commission of India following an allegation levelled by Sashank that the former had directly interfered in the election process and the security arrangement for the polls. Called by the influential NGO Coordination Committee, an umbrella body of major civil society organisations and student associations, the peaceful demonstration involved people from all walks of life. All government offices, schools, and business establishments remained closed for the day in support of the statewide protest. Along with Aizawl, the protest rallies were held in different parts of the state under the aegis of the NGO. A total shutdown was also observed in the Mamit town of western Mizoram to intensify the demand for the CEO’s ouster. The protesters warned that the Election Commission of India would be responsible if Mizoram’s record of holding the most peaceful elections in the country since 1972 turned into a nightmare this time. The poll panel sent a three-member delegation to Aizawl on Tuesday which was greeted with black flags on their way to the capital from Lengpui. The delegation met civil society leaders late in the evening and assured them that they will put up the matter before the Election Commission of India. Shashank had told reporters on Tuesday night that the Election Commission of India had suggested that he leave Mizoram and go to New Delhi to avoid further administrative crisis ahead of polls. He had said that he would leave for Delhi Wednesday afternoon. The issue erupted after the CEO wrote a letter to the Election Commission of India in which he accused Chuaungo of obstructing their request to make special arrangements for displaced Brus/Reangs to come and vote in the state elections. Many of these Brus had been driven out of Mizoram due to ethnic conflicts with the Mizos in the late 90s and have been living in relief camps in Tripura for the past couple of decades. According to Sashank, Chuaungo — a 1987-batch Gujarat-cadre IAS officer — opposed the usage of identification slip of Bru voters for any other purpose except for repatriation. The CEO asked the poll panel to remove Chuaungo from his post as the latter had also interfered in the security arrangement for the polls. The Mizoram chief electoral officer also said that arrangement for deployment of Central Armed Police Forces personnel were being done based on the recommendation of the poll panel. The Election Commission of India has recommended 40 companies of Central Armed Police Forces, which according to Shashank was reasonably require to ensure free and fair elections. Acting swiftly on the complaint raised by Sashank, the Election Commission of India removed Chuaungo on 2 November and barred him from his work until the elections. The unprecedented move infuriated civil society organisations who have served a 'quit Mizoram notice' to the CEO asking him to leave Mizoram by 5 November to avoid mass protests. The NGOs said that Chuaungo, a Mizo officer, acted like any other Mizo and refused Bru identification slips to be used for electoral purposes. The NGOs are also against the deployment of additional personnel from the Central Armed Police Forces during the election, terming it a waste of the state's resources. The civil society groups are of the opinion that the Bru people, who are reluctant to return, should not be allowed to exercise their franchise outside the state and they should be allowed to cast their votes only in their respective constituencies inside Mizoram. Meanwhile, Shashank said that he was simply doing his duty based on the ECI's directive and that he didn't intend to hurt the sentiments of the people. Addressing a protest rally in Aizawl, NGO Coordination Committee chairman and YMA president Vanlalruata alleged that Sashank was creating a rift in the Mizo society. Vanlalruata also warned that Mizos will look towards other East Asian countries if the Central Government continues to neglect the state. The YMA president also added that they will cooperate with the Election Commission of India to ensure free and fair elections if Sashank is removed. YMA vice-president R Lalngheta threatened that they will resort to any sort of protest until the CEO leaves Mizoram. On Tuesday, YMA volunteers at Kolasib and Kawnpui towns on the Mizoram-Assam border   ferrying CAPF personnel and forced them to return to Aizawl. President of the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) or Mizo Students Federation, L Ramdinliana Renthlei shared the platform with Vanlalruata and said that while the Indian government paid sincere attention to the Bru issues, the voices of the Mizo people have always been unheard. “We have been neglected several times by the Union of India. The Mizo youths will not hesitate to take up arms like in the 1966 uprising if the Central Government continues to turn a deaf ear to our voices,” he said, adding that Mizoram will fall into a state of turmoil if the Election Commission of India allows Bru people to exercise their franchise outside the state. Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday to restore status quo. Fleeing communal tension triggered by the murder of a Mizo forest guard by Bru militants in 1997, thousands of Brus fled Mizoram and live in six transit camps in Tripura since then. Several attempts to repatriate them have turned futile. Between August and September, only 40 families out of the 30,000 people in the camps chose to return home despite the announcement that the Centre and Tripura government would suspend all their relief and allowances from October and also shut down the camps.",2018-11-08,"Aizawl,Assembly Election 2018,Bru,Bru Refugees,EC,ECI,Election Commission Of India,Lal Thanhawla,Mizo Students Federation,Mizo Zirlai Pawl,Mizoram,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Polls,NewsTracker,NGO,NGOs Coordination Committee,SB Sashank,Tripura,YMA","Mizoram polls: NGOs stage protests, demand removal of election official over status of Bru refugee voters; threaten armed rebellion",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-ngos-stage-protests-demand-removal-of-election-official-over-status-of-bru-refugee-voters-threaten-armed-rebellion-5515571.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who is trying to unite opposition parties to take on BJP in the Lok Sabha elections next year, will meet former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and chief minister HD Kumaraswamy here on Thursday. Naidu will meet Gowda at his residence at Padmanabha Nagar and Kumaraswamy would also be present during the meeting, JD(S) said on Wednesday. Interestingly, Naidu's meeting with the JD(S) supremo comes in the backdrop of Congress-JD(S) coalition resolving to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together against the BJP,buoyed by the victory in the . The Congress-JD(S)coalition in Karnataka on Tuesday won two of the three Lok Sabha seats and both assembly constituencies in the fiercely fought by-polls, giving a shot in the arm to the ruling combine that faces frequent questions about its longevity. BJP had managed to hold on to the Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat. The electoral sweep by the ruling coalition comes as a boost to it as the by-polls were seen as a barometer of the public mood ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Naidu had called his Karnataka counterpart over the phone on Tuesday and congratulated the latter on the JD(S)-Congress combine's ""spectacular victory"" in the by-elections. JD(S) MLC Sharavana said Naidu's meeting with Gowda is in continuation of the discussions the Andhra chief minister was holding with ""secular"" party leaders across the country.

Press Trust of India," RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav, who met his father Lalu Prasad in Ranchi on Saturday regarding his decision to divorce his wife, did not return here as expected but left mid-way for an unknown destination, sources close to the family said on Tuesday. Yadav had met his father for a couple of hours at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in Ranchi, where the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo is lodged in custody in connection with a fodder scam case, Saturday and checked in at a Bodh Gaya hotel Sunday night, local MLA Kumar Sarvjeet said. He left the hotel Monday afternoon, saying he was going to Patna, Sarvjeet added. ""I met Yadav, along with other party leaders, over dinner Sunday. He was looking exhausted. He bade us goodbye Monday, saying he was returning home. I have the knowledge of his movements only till his departure from the Royal Residency hotel,"" the MLA told PTI over the phone. The mercurial elder son of Prasad and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, however, was yet to reach Patna, his family sources said. Yadav had told reporters after meeting Prasad that he stood by his decision to give divorce to his wife of six months, Aishwarya Rai. ""No person can live a stifled life,"" he had said. Yadav is said to be fond of visiting places of pilgrimage like Vrindavan and Varanasi for spiritual solace and one of his grouses against his wife is that she has not been able to adjust to his way of life. Yadav, a former Bihar health minister, had recently spent a number of days in Vrindavan, where he was reportedly seen playing the flute with a peacock feather tied to his head in the midst of a herd of cows. Neither Aishwarya, who is the daughter of RJD MLA Chandrika Rai and granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai, nor any member of her family has spoken on the matter so far. She had tied the knot with Yadav on May 12 and the RJD leader had moved an application seeking divorce on November 2, citing incompatibility. Yadav has also been dropping hints that he is not getting along well with younger brother Tejashwi, who has emerged as the party's de facto leader in their father's absence. Prasad, who is serving sentences in fodder scam cases, had flown in from Ranchi after obtaining parole from a court to attend Yadav's wedding, which was attended by the leaders of virtually all the political parties, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Setting political acrimony aside, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it wished that the young couple resolved their differences and reunited on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali. 
""It is a family matter, which has to be resolved by both sides. One should refrain from making political statements on the issue. It is unfortunate for a young couple to have experienced such a discord. Best wishes to Aishwarya, who is the daughter of the society, and hopes for her happy reunion with Tej Pratap by Deepawali,"" state BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said.",2018-11-08,"Aishwarya Rai,BIhar,Lalu Prasad Yadav,NewsTracker,Ranchi,RJD,Tej Pratap Yadav,Tejashwi Yada","Tej Pratap Yadav hasn't come back to Patna after meeting Lalu Prasad Yadav at Ranchi hospital, say sources close to family",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/tej-pratap-yadav-hasnt-come-back-to-patna-after-meeting-lalu-prasad-yadav-at-ranchi-hospital-say-sources-close-to-family-5516921.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"The top brass of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — meaning Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah — can’t be in a particularly festive mood with the Karnataka by-election results rolling in as a somewhat early, if poisoned, Diwali gift. But 4:1 defeat the BJP suffered at the hands of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance has to be unpacked a bit before its wider significance can be fathomed. The statistics of the three Lok Sabha seats to which bypolls were held are illuminating. The BJP retained the Shivamogga seat, but its winning margin was seriously trimmed — down from the 3.63 lakh votes by which BS Yeddyurappa had won the constituency in 2014 to the 52,148 his son BY Raghavendra managed. The Congress' VS Ugrappa wrested the Bellary seat by nearly 3 lakh votes, overturning the 95,000 margin by which the BJP had won the seat in 2014. In Mandya, the JD(S) won by almost 3.25 lakh votes, but in 2014, it had scored a narrow victory over the Congress, with the BJP finishing a distant third. We will return to this result later. The Assembly election results were, in fact, less significant statistically. In Ramanagaram, Anitha Kumaraswami won the seat her husband vacated by almost 1.1 lakh votes. Earlier this year, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy had defeated his Congress rival by a margin of around 22,000 votes, while the BJP had breasted the tape a poor third. In Jamakhandi, the Congress candidate retained the seat by a margin of close to 40,000 votes, while earlier this year, it had secured a margin of a little less than 3,000 votes. The really significant result among the Lok Sabha seats contested is the one for the Bellary constituency, which the Congress wrested from the BJP, overturning the significant margin by which it had lost in 2014. The Shivamogga result is quite important, as well, since the BJP saw its margin in a pocket borough nosedive. However, the Mandya result should encourage the BJP: it pulled in third with around 87,000 votes, while it polled almost 2.45 lakh in the by-elections. As for the Assembly results, the significance of the Congress party’s victory in Jamakhandi lies in the exponentially increased margin, though the BJP can take some comfort, not so much from the marginal increase in votes polled in Ramanagaram, where it had finished third earlier this year, as from the fact that the votes the alliance polled were nowhere near the aggregate of the votes polled as separate parties earlier this year. However, in the broader context of the impending Lok Sabha elections, the Ramanagaram and Mandya results offer cold comfort to a party that is forever looking to aggrandise itself because the overall results have clearly spelled out what regional alliances can achieve — the grinding down of the self-proclaimed puissance of the party now ruling in Delhi. Before we get to that, a few observations about the Karnataka results are in order. Local factors affected the precise contours of the results in some of the constituencies. In Ramanagaram, the BJP candidate practically pulled out of the fray two days before the elections to rejoin the Congress, while in Bellary, the sitting BJP candidate is reported to have complained that he hardly got any support from his party, while the alliance carpet bombed the constituency. But whether these are extenuating factors for the BJP is a moot question. It could well appear to many that these are, in fact, straws in the wind indicating that the electoral turnaround the party so loudly trumpeted earlier this year has evaporated. The BJP is on a sticky wicket in Karnataka. And so it could be, too, elsewhere. In Uttar Pradesh, the replication of the alliance between the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which succeeded in defeating the BJP in three important by-elections — those in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, first, and then in Kairana — earlier this year could by itself imperil its ambitious 2019 project. To recapitulate, the BJP and its allies won 73 of the 80 seats in 2014. If Opposition unity derails the saffron party in India’s biggest state, significant changes could ensue. The outlook is not look particularly bright for the BJP in Maharashtra, the state that, at 48 seats, contributes the second largest number of seats to the Lok Sabha. In 2014, the party won 41 of these in alliance with the Shiv Sena against a divided Opposition. In 2019, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party will most likely contest as allies, unless the understanding they have already reached breaks down inexplicably. The threat posed by this alliance is compounded by the very real possibility that the Shiv Sena will not be in alliance with the BJP in 2019, an intention reiterated forcefully and often. Take four other states where the BJP practically wiped out the Opposition: Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It won all the 51 seats from Gujarat and Rajasthan and 37 of the 40 seats in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The Congress failed to firm up alliances in the three states where elections will begin to be held days from now. However, if buoyed by the Karnataka results, it does succeed in doing so next year, the BJP could face serious losses. The five states mentioned above contribute 219 seats to the Lok Sabha, of which the party and its allies won 202 in 2014. The BJP’s duopoly is now treading on thin ice. If media reports are to be believed, Shah is trying to brush aside the threat posed by Opposition unity at the state level, while also talking up the BJP’s chances of scoring big in the North East, east and south. It is not quite clear what kind of mathematics is at play here. Shah’s claims sound suspiciously, like sheer braggadocio, but the Opposition will not complain if it breeds an air of complacence.",2018-11-07,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections,Amit Shah,Assembly Elections,BJP,Congress,Karnataka,Karnataka By Election Results 2018,Karnataka By-Elections,Karnataka Bypoll Results,Karnataka Bypolls,Opposition,Opposition Alliance,PoliticsDecoder,Uttar Pradesh","Karnataka bypoll results eye-opener for BJP, show what Opposition unity could do its overweening ambitions for 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/karnataka-bypoll-results-eye-opener-for-bjp-show-what-opposition-unity-could-do-its-overweening-ambitions-for-2019-5515891.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Hours after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath  , the Gujarat government on Tuesday said it was keen on renaming Ahmedabad as Karnavati, if there were no legal hurdles. Speaking to reporters in Gandhinagar, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was willing to change Ahmedabad's name if it gets past the legal hurdles and receives required support. ""People are still having a feeling that Ahmedabad should be renamed as Karnavati. If we get required support to overcome the legal hurdles, we are always ready to change the name of the city,"" Patel told reporters when asked if the state government had a plan to rename India's only city that has the 'World Heritage' tag. Historically, the area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as Ashaval. Chaulukya ruler Karna of Anhilwara (modern Patan) had waged a successful war against the Bhil king of Ashaval and established a city called Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati river. Sultan Ahmed Shah in 1411 AD had laid the foundation of a new walled city near Karnavati and named it Ahmedabad after the four saints in the area by the name Ahmed. ""We can think of changing the name at an appropriate time,"" Patel added. Slamming the BJP government over the issue, state unit Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said the promise to rename Ahmedabad was just another ""poll gimmick"" by the ruling party. ""For the BJP, issues like construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and renaming Ahmedabad as Karnavati are the means to get votes of Hindus,"" said Mr Doshi. ""BJP leaders dump such issues after coming to power. They only cheated Hindus all these years."" Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on the eve of Diwali, announced that Faizabad district would henceforth be known as Ayodhya. ""Ayodhya is a symbol of our ' ' (honour, pride and prestige),"" Adityanath said in Ayodhya.

Ramakrishna Upadhya,"The impending results of five by-elections from Karnataka, due to be announced on Tuesday, are expected to help the Congress-JD(S) combine to evaluate the effect of its maiden electoral partnership. Simultaneously, they will also put under scanner BS Yeddyurappa’s leadership of the state BJP. The three Lok Sabha and two Assembly seats which went to polls across the state on Saturday, hold the key to political alignment and the selection of candidates in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, which are less than six months away. In both Ramanagaram Assembly and Mandya Lok Sabha seats — which the JD(S) is trying to retain – while the local Congress leaders campaigned reluctantly for their traditional rivals, the party workers minced no words in expressing their resentment at the ‘imposed alliance’ with those whom they had fought for decades. But, fortunately for the JD(S), as the BJP has negligible presence in both the constituencies, it could well be a walkover with Anitha Kumaraswamy, Chief Minister Kumaraswamy’s wife, easily entering the Assembly and LR Shivarame Gowda being elected to the Lok Sabha for a short stint of five months. In a huge embarrassment to the BJP, just two days before the campaigning ended, its candidate L Chandresekhar retired from contest and rejoined the Congress, of which he was a member until a fortnight ago. With egg on their faces, the BJP leaders cried ‘betrayal’ and ‘use of money power by the JD(S)’, but irreversible damage had been done. Chandresekhar’s contention was that he was left to fend for himself as no senior BJP leader came to campaign for him while Yeddyurappa said he ignored Chandrasekhar as he “smelt” that there was something wrong with his candidature. The central BJP leaders have taken umbrage at the faux pas and begun an inquiry as to how such a serious blunder was committed. The focus is on Yeddyurappa’s role as state president, as in May 2018, he had similarly embarrassed the party by getting sworn-in as chief minister but failing to mobilise the support of at least eight MLAs to stitch together a majority. Yeddyurappa faces another sterner test as he has fielded his son, BY Raghavendra from Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat vacated by him. Raghavendra had been elected once earlier, but now he is facing a tough fight from JD(S)’s candidate, Madhu Bangarappa. Shivamogga was traditionally a Congress bastion as its candidates have won 11 out of 15 elections, until Yeddyurappa emerged as a leader from this Malnad region. Former chief minister Bangarappa, apart from getting elected to the Assembly eight times, had won Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat thrice, once each from the Congress, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party. Banking on late Bangarappa’s popularity, JD(S) staked claim over this seat as Madhu happens to be a member of the party. In the recent Assembly elections, Madhu had been defeated by his elder brother, Kumar Bangarappa of the BJP in Sagara constituency. It was a reversal of fortunes, as in 2013 Madhu had defeated Kumar from the same constituency. The campaign turned nasty when Kumaraswamy’s personal barb at Kumar accusing him of shabbily treating his father in his last days, was returned by Kumar who spoke of Kumaraswamy’s actress-second wife, Radhika Kumaraswamy potentially resorting to ‘Me Too’ to embarrass him. The by-election to Ballary Lok Sabha seat also produced a lot of heat and dust as BJP’s Sriramulu, on getting elected to the Assembly, has put up his sister J Shantha, who is being opposed by VS Ugrappa of the Congress. Though Ugrappa is an outsider to this constituency, he is being strongly backed by Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, who are playing the ‘backward class card.’ Ballary had seen an intense battle between Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj in late 1990s, which Sonia won, but it is no longer a safe seat for the Congress. The JD(S) has extended support to the Congress, though its presence here is minimal. At Jamkhandi, the Congress has put up Anand Siddu Nyamagouda, son of Nyamagouda, who died in an accident soon after the May election. Srikanth Kulakarni of the BJP, who had lost narrowly last time, is also seeking sympathy from the voters. Whichever way these election results go, they are expected to help all three parties to fine tune their strategies for the mega fight in the April-May 2019 Lok Sabha polls.",2018-11-05,"Ballary,BJP,BS Yeddyurappa,Congress,JD(S),Karnataka Bypolls,Madhu Bangarappa,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Shivamogga","Karnataka bypolls: Tough test for BY Raghavendra in Shivamogga, Anitha Kumaraswamy on strong footing",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/karnataka-bypolls-from-hd-kumaraswamys-wife-to-bs-yeddyurappas-son-jds-congress-and-bjp-anxious-about-results-5507681.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," The BJP on Monday declared its second list of 17 candidates for the 28 November Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, fielding Lok Sabha member Anoop Mishra, who is nephew of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and dropping five sitting MLAs.

Press Trust of India,": Ruling JD(U) on Monday said it attached no importance to ""prejudiced and provocative"" remarks by Union minister Upendra Kushwaha against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The war of words between Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), the two constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), indicates that the notes of discord continued to emanate from within the coalition. The RLSP, which is headed by Kushwaha, hit back saying the JD(U) was jittery over Kumar's declining popularity and the growing appeal of Upendra Kushwaha, especially among the backwards and the Dalits. ""We do not wish to comment on a remark that is prejudiced and provocative. It is well-known that Nitish Kumar has always maintained high standards of public discourse,"" JD(U) state president Vashishtha Narayan Singh told reporters. He was reacting to remarks made by Kushwaha on Sunday wherein Kumar was accused of having called the Union minister   (lowly). At a function organized in Patna on Saturday, the chief minister had said in response to queries about his uneasy relations - in the context of the issue of seat sharing among NDA constituents having become a thorny one, ""please do not lower the level of discourse so much ( )."" Taking affront to the remark, Kushwaha in Muzaffarpur district on Sunday had said, ""I have always called Nitish Kumar my elder brother but he calls me  ."" The RLSP chief also taunted his former mentor for having expressed outrage, three years ago, over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark that Kumar's political vacillations indicated something is wrong with his DNA. Kushwaha's remarks were also disapproved by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey who said ""the RLSP chief must give a chief minister the respect that is his due. He is himself a Union minister and should avoid indulging in a slanging match."" Maintaining that Kumar's remark was meant to belittle Kushwaha, RLSP national general secretary Madhaw Anand said in a statement ""our leader has always treated Kumar with great respect but the same has never been reciprocated."" ""If he holds such poor opinions about Kushwaha, why did he make the latter the leader of the Opposition in Bihar assembly and sent him to Rajya Sabha later on,"" Anand said. ""Consistency has never been Nitish Kumar's virtue but this time he has hurt the party and shocked the people of Bihar as well,"" he said. ""Kumar is worried about his own falling popularity and jittery over Kushwaha's efforts like the   campaign which has taken the important issue of reservations in the judiciary to the masses, thereby earning him the goodwill of Dalits and OBCs,"" Anand claimed. Kuswaha, a close aide of Kumar fell out with the JD(U) national president and later launched his own party RLSP on the eve of 2014 general election and became a member of the NDA. Kushwaha, whose party won all three Lok Sabha seats it had contested in Bihar in last Parliamentary polls, was made Union Minister of State for Human Resource and Development (HRD). The RLSP chief has been feeling uneasy within NDA after return of Kumar to the coalition in July, 2017. The simmering hostility between the two leaders escalated after BJP chief Amit Shah in the company of Kumar announced in Delhi recently that the two parties would fight equal number of seats in Bihar in Lok Sabha 2019 election which was taken in the political circle as an indication of Kushwaha's marginalisation in the coalition.",2018-11-05,"Amit Shah,Ashwini Kumar Choubey,Bharatiya Janata Party,BIhar,Bihar Assembly,Janata Dal United,JD-U,Madhaw Anand,Narendra Modi,National Democratic Alliance,NewsTracker,Nitish Kumar,Rashtriya Lok Samata Party,RSLP,Upendra Kushwaha","JD(U) hits out at Upendra Kushwaha over his remarks targetting Nitish Kumar, terms comments 'prejudiced and provocative'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jdu-hits-out-at-upendra-kushwaha-over-his-remarks-targetting-nitish-kumar-terms-comments-prejudiced-and-provocative-5507631.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The ruling Congress-JD(S) combine in Karnataka is all set to face a popularity test on Tuesday, with results expected for three Lok Sabha and two Assembly constituencies which had gone for polls on Saturday. A total of 1,248 counting staff have been deployed for the counting of votes, which will begin at 8 am on Tuesday. An estimated 67 percent voter turnout of the 54.5 lakh electorate was recorded in the bypolls for the five constituencies. Polling was held from 7 am to 6 pm in Ballari (ST), Mandya and Shivamogga parliamentary constituencies and Jamkhandi and Ramanagara Assembly segments. According to provisional data at the end of polling, 77.17 percent voting was recorded in Jamkhandi, followed by 71.88 percent in Ramanagara, 63.85 percent in Ballari, 61.05 percent in Shivamogga and 53.93 percent in Mandya. A total of 31 candidates were in the fray from all the five constituencies, including five from the Opposition BJP, three from JD(S) and two from the Congress. 21 others are Independents or from regional outfits. As the ruling coalition, the JD(S) and Congress have fielded joint candidates in the bypolls to consolidate their votes. JD(S) is contesting from Mandya, Shivamogga and Ramanagara and the Congress from Ballari and Jamkhandi. Elaborate security arrangements have been made for Tuesday to ensure to that no untoward incident takes place during the counting of votes, police officials told . Police have been deployed around the counting centres and strongrooms where the EVMs are placed. The results of the bypolls will determine the fate of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's wife Anita Kumaraswamy, state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa's son BY Raghavendra and former chief minister S Bangarappa's son Madhu Bangarappa, among others. Anitha Kumaraswamy is expected to have a smooth sailing in Ramanagara — the seat vacated by her husband — after BJP nominee L Chandrashekhar withdrew from the contest and rejoined the Congress last week. The Congress is also confident of winning the Ramanagara Assembly seat. In Jamkhandi, it remains to be seen whether Congress' Anand Nyamagowda will be able to make his successful electoral debut. Anand is son of former MLA Siddu Nyamagouda, whose sudden death in a road mishap on 28 May necessitated the bypoll. Srikant Kulkarni is the BJP candidate against Siddu. In Shivamogga, Yeddyurappa's son BY Raghavendra is testing his fortunes against another former chief minister S Bangarappa's son Madhu Bangarappa of the JD(S), in Ballari, senior BJP leader Sriramulu's sister J Shantha is fighting against VS Ugrappa of the Congress, considered an outsider.  In the Vokkaliga bastion of Mandya, JD(S)' Shivarame Gowda, is pitted against a fresh face in retired commercial tax officer Siddaramaiah from the BJP. While the BJP is attempting to make inroads into the JD(S) bastion of Mandya and the Congress stronghold of Jamkhandi, the Congress is trying to regain its significance in its erstwhile party stronghold of Ballari, the seat earlier won by its top leader Sonia Gandhi. Differences between Congress and JD(S) workers had come to the fore in Ramanagara and Mandya constituencies that fall under the old Mysuru region over the party's decision to support the JDS candidates. Congress and JD(S) had fought bitterly against each other in the Assembly polls, especially in the old Mysuru region, but had joined hands to form a coalition government after a fractured mandate in the May Assembly polls. The outcome of the bypolls is expected to have a bearing on the equations between the Congress and JDS for the 2019 polls and also be a factor in determining the respective bargaining power of the two parties. The bypolls were seen as significant as the coalition partners contested together, terming it as a ""prelude"" to the general elections and called for a similar ""grand secular alliance"" against the BJP at the national level. The Lok Sabha by-elections were necessitated after Yeddyurappa (Shivamogga) and Sriramalu (Ballari), and CS Puttaraju of JD(S) (Mandya) resigned as MPs on their election to the Assembly in May.

Press Trust of India,"If there is a common thread in campaign theme of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the BJP in the 7 December Assembly polls, it's certainly their unsparing attack on the Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu. The pre-poll pact of TDP — the ruling party of the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh — and the Congress for election to the 119-member Telangana Assembly, has also come under fire by the TRS and BJP, which have repeatedly dubbed it ""unholy"". After all, how can TDP, a party formed in 1982 by actor-turned-politician NTR on an anti-Congress plank and to uphold Telugu self-respect in 1982, join hands with the very outfit, they ask. TRS and BJP leaders allege that if the Congress-TDP alliance comes to power in Telangana, it would be Naidu who would be calling the shots from the Andhra Pradesh capital of Amaravati. Congress and TDP leaders strongly counter their arguments, saying they joined forces to fight the ""divisive and destructive politics"" of the BJP and end the ""misrule"" of the TRS government, which let all sections of people down with its ""false promises."" ""Congress is sold out to TDP,"" Telangana BJP spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao claimed, and alleged that Telangana Congress was being run by Naidu. ""Candidates of the Congress-TDP alliance are being dictated by Naidu. He seems to be the chief sponsor of Telangana Congress Party both financially and also administratively,"" he said. If there is a possibility of formation of government under Congress, then the de-facto chief minister will be in Andhra Pradesh, not in Telangana. And Chandrababu Naidu will be running Telangana through remote control with his de-facto powers, Rao alleged. TDP spokesperson Lanka Dinakar reminded the TRS that it had an alliance with TDP in the 2009 elections in the undivided Andhra Pradesh. Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. 
TDP was formed in Hyderabad, now capital of Telangana, he recalled. Describing as ""political gimmick"" the TRS contention that Naidu opposed irrigation projects in Telangana, Dinakar said the K Chandrasekhar Rao government, instead, should tell people what development and welfare measures they initiated during their tenure. He claimed that there has been no problem between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on sharing of water resources, and charged the BJP-led NDA with delaying resolution of procedural issues for political gains. On TRS-BJP's allegation that Naidu would ""control"" Telangana's affairs if Congress-TDP alliance comes to power, Dinakar dismissed it as ""inconceivable"". Those who make such a charge have no respect for federal spirit, constitution and democratic values, he said. Senior Congress leader Marri Shashidhar Reddy, also former Vice-Chairman of National Disaster Management Authority, defended the Congress-TDP electoral pact, saying the alliance was a ""compulsion"" and need of the hour. On charges that Naidu was putting hurdles on Telangana irrigation projects, Reddy, son of former Chief Minister Marri Chenna Reddy, told PTI that Telangana people have been opposing AP's Polavaram project. ""These are all things which were different situation altogether. When we (Congress-TDP) come together (to form government), there will be a common agenda, there will be a common understanding. What happened in the past cannot prevent us from moving ahead. We will come out with common agenda. If any aberration of the past, will not be repeated,"" he said. Reddy, Chairman of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee's Election Commission Coordination Committee, said the BJP is panicky about the moves made in the last few days by Naidu to bring together all forces opposed to the BJP. ""The alliance is to save the people from misrule.... falsehood... promises, people of all sections feel let down,"" he said. ""It's a compulsion and need of the hour. It's to fight divisive and destructive politics (of the BJP).""

FP Politics,"Mizoram Speaker Hiphei jumping ship to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the Assembly elections comes as   in the North East state. Hiphei resigned from his post as well as from the Congress primary membership on Monday, citing dissatisfaction with the party for ignoring his candidature for the polls from the Palak constituency. The 81-year-old political figure said he decided to quit came after Mizoram Congress president and Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla failed to give a ""green signal"" for his candidature. ""The Congress was very unkind to me. Thanhawla and other party leaders not only failed to approve my name but also told me to resign,"" he claimed. ""The Mara Autonomous District Congress Committee nomination board recommended my name three times and All India Congress Committee (AICC) agreed that I would be the official Congress candidate for Palak constituency. But I was kept in the dark. The state Congress failed to officially release a list of candidate several days after the AICC approved my name,"" Hiphei said. While Hiphei has a positive outlook about his decision to join the saffron party, the Congress believes that this might be the beginning of the end of his political career. Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Lallianchhunga said Hiphei's steadfast loyalty to the Congress had contributed towards his stellar political career, which included his work as a two-time Rajya Sabha MP from 1990 to 1996 and 1996 to 2002. Lallianchhunga is also confident that Hiphei's resignation was unlikely to impact Congress' chances in the state as he had been under the scanner for a long time. He said the Congress had been suspicious of Hiphei's link with the BJP — considered communal and anti-Christian party by Mizos — after he sold his building to the party a few years ago. However, political observers in Mizoram likely rightly believe that Hiphei's decision will affect the Congress' prospects in the state not only because he is an influential mass leader, but also as Hiphei was the fifth Congress legislator to resign from the Mizoram legislature since September. The others were R Lalzirliana, Lalrinliana Sailo, Dr BD Chakma and Hmingdailova Khiangte. He added that the Congress is likely to be defeated due to the internal differences and squabbles in the grand old party. The seven-time Congress legislator who was once a staunch BJP critic said he was happy to join the saffron party as he did not come across any anti-Christian elements in its ideology. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has nearly completed his tenure but during these five years, the BJP government did not amend our constitution to alter the secular feature. The party completely believes in secularism and the BJP-led government would not pose any threat to the Mizos and their religion,"" he said. After joining the BJP in the presence of party leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is also the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance, Hiphei said he had joined the BJP as he wanted to contribute towards the development of Mizoram. Hiphei, also known as 'Father of Mara"" (a native tribe in Mizoram), was dropped from the   for the upcoming Assembly elections.

FP Politics,"In an emphatic endorsement of Karnataka's ruling JD(S)-Congress coalition by the voters, its candidates Tuesday won both the assembly constituencies and clinched victory in two of the three Lok Sabha seats in the bitterly fought by-polls held on Saturday, officials said. The byelections came as a major setback for the main opposition BJP ahead of the 2019 elections with the party losing the Bellary Lok Sabha seat, considered a stronghold of the controversial mining barons — the Reddy brothers. V S Ugrappa of the Congress established a lead of more than 2.14 lakh votes in Bellary over BJP's J Shantha, the sister of B Sriramulu, a key aide of the Reddys and former MP from there. The BJP was leading only in Shivamogga parliamentary seat, the pocket borough of the Leader of the Opposition B S Yeyyurappa. His son B Y Raghavendra has established a lead of more than 51,000 votes over Madhu Bangarappa of the JD(S). Madhu is the son of former Congress chief minister the late S Bangarappa.     Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha bagged the Ramanagara assembly seat by a spectacular margin of 1,09,137 against her nearest rival BJP's L Chandrashekar, who had pulled out of the contest, but still officially remains the party candidate. Chandrashekhar, who had joined the BJP ahead of the polls returned to Congress weeks later, leaving the saffron party red-faced and the field open for a walkover for Anitha Kumaraswamy. Ramanagara seat fell vacant after Kumaraswamy preferred to retain Chennapatna, the other constituency from where he had won. In Jamkhandi, Congress candidate Anand Nyamgouda defeated BJP's Srikant Kulkarni by a margin of 39,480 votes, riding a sympathy wave following his father and sitting MLA Siddu Nyamagouda's death in a road accident. With Tuesday's victory, the Congress-JD(S) alliance's tally will go up to 120 seats in the 224 member assembly where the BJP has 104 MLAs. In Mandya Lok Sabha constituency, JD(S) candidate L Shivarame Gowda has established a lead of a staggering 3.24 lakh votes over BJP candidate Siddaramaiah, a political green horn and a former civil servant. Mandya is a stronghold of the Vokkaliga community to which JD(S) supremo and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda belongs. Elated over the performance of the ruling alliance candidates, jubilant Congress workers distributed sweets and broke coconuts at various places. Karnataka Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao claimed the results reflected the disenchantment of people with the BJP. ""Look at the margins...it's clear that people are fed up with the BJP. This anti-people, anti-farmer, anti-women government at the Centre must go. ""All forces need to come together to take on the BJP. BJP will be wiped out of Karnataka in 2019 (Lok Sabha polls). If it is wiped out in Karnataka, it will be wiped out in the entire south India,"" he said. ""I congratulate Congress leaders in the state and at the Centre. I also congratulate JDS state leaders and workers who worked towards this win,"" chief minister HD Kumaraswamy told the media on Tuesday. ""BJP calls JDS-Congress coalition 'Apavitra Maitri', today that contention has been nullified."" These elections were the first step, said the chief minister and added that JD(S) will work with Congress on all the 28 Lok Sabha ""to win all of them"". ""...that is our goal. This is not an empty boast just because we have won today. This is the confidence of people in us. This win is not making us arrogant,"" Kumaraswamy said. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Dinesh Gundu Rao has described the success in the by-elections as the success of coalition government. ""The by-elections were considered as important for the coalition government. We have contested the by-elections in association with coalition partner. BJP has struggled a lot to win in Shivamogga. Our candidates have got elected from four constituencies — two Assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats,"" says Dinesh Gundu Rao. Karnataka is the only south Indian state where the BJP has been in power. The by-elections for three Lok Sabha seats were necessitated after Yeddyurappa and Sriramulu of the BJP and C S Puttaraju of the JD(S) vacated Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya following their election to the assembly in May.

Press Trust of India,": People congregated in large numbers in front of Mizoram Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) SB Shashank's office on Tuesday following a call by an umbrella organisation of major civil societies and student associations to picket his office demanding his removal. The NGO Coordination Committee had sought Shashank's exit from the state by Monday evening, shortly after the Election Commission (EC) removed state's principal secretary (Home) Lalnunmawia Chuaungo. A section of media said Shashank had complained to the EC that Chuaungo was interfering in the poll process. ""As people have lost faith in him, the only solution for smooth conduct of the Assembly elections 2018 now would be removal of CEO S B Shashank from office forthwith,"" Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday. Elections to the 40-member Mizoram Assembly are scheduled for 28 November. Police said the CEO was at home and did not come to his office. The conglomerate, which had Friday demanded that Shashank leave Mizoram by Monday evening, decided to picket before the CEO's office, which is located at Treasury Square, from Tuesday and not allow him to attend office. The NGO Coordination Committee also appealed to the Federation of Mizoram Government Employees and Workers (FMGEW) to support the agitation and cease work from Tuesday. All shops in Aizawl city, except a few restaurants, were closed on Tuesday morning in response to a call made by the Mizoram Merchants' Association (MiMA). The protesters demanded the ouster of Shashank, who, they alleged have hurt the sentiments of the Mizo people by his ""pro-Bru"" stance for conducting the elections. The civil society bodies have appealed to the owners of commercial vehicles not to allow their vehicles to be used for transporting central paramilitary forces from outside the state to Mizoram. Vehicles bound for Assam to transport the Central Armed Police Forces were stopped by volunteers of a prominent non-governmental organisation in Mizoram since Monday, police said. The 76 vehicles, sent by the State Election Department to transport the CAPF personnel, were halted by volunteers of the Young Mizo Association (YMA) at Kolasib and Kawnpui towns, bordering Assam. Most of the vehicles have returned to Aizawl, police said. Earlier on Monday, the CEO told a press meet here that he was just fulfilling his responsibilities in accordance with the instructions of the EC. The EC, in its Friday's order, had said, ""... the Election Commission is satisfied that the continuance of Mr. Lalnunmawia Chuaungo as principal Secretary (Home), in state 
government of Mizoram will have adverse impact on conduct of smooth, free and fair election process in Mizoram."" The order mentioned six incidents, mainly related to the arrangements to enable the Bru refugees staying in camps in Tripura, take part in the voting process. Thousands of people from the Bru community had fled Mizoram in the late 1990s following ethnic clashes. Chuaungo, a native of the state and Gujarat-cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, has been relieved of his responsibilities. On his fallout with Chuaungo, the CEO said he had issued a statement to the district election officers (DEO) and the electoral registration officers (ERO) on September 11 to notify that ""identification slips could be used as valid documents by eligible Bru migrants in Tripura"". Chuaungo, however, issued another order on 13 September, asking the Bru refugees to not use the identification slips, except for the purpose of repatriation, he said. Shashank had alleged that Chuaungo and Chief Secretary Arvind Ray did not issue any clarification on the 13 September order, despite the EC's instructions. Earlier, too, the civil society organisations had opposed the EC's decision to conduct electoral revision of the Bru voters in Tripura's relief camps. They also urged the EC to disenfranchise all the Bru voters who chose to stay back in Tripura and did not return to Mizoram.",2018-11-06,"Assembly Election 2018,Bru,Mizo,Mizoram,Mizorma Assembly Election 2018,Mizroam Chief Electoral Officer,NewsTracker,SB Shashank",Protesters picket Mizoram Chief Electoral Officer SB Shashank's office demanding his removal for pro-Bru stance,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/protesters-picket-mizoram-chief-electoral-officer-sb-shashanks-office-demanding-his-removal-for-pro-bru-stance-5511031.html,firstpost,-1,0

Francis Paul," The name of Mizoram’s newest political party is a mouthful, but its acronym is catchy. “We did all that we could as an NGO, but the government did not listen or act,” says party president Vanlalruata on why he decided to enter the political arena. Focusing on fighting corruption and improving administrative systems, People’s Right to Information and Development Implementation Society of Mizoram (PRISM) was an NGO. The conversion to a political party on 3 November last year that will be putting up candidates for the 28 November Assembly elections was named People’s Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram, retaining the acronym PRISM. “During the 12 years PRISM functioned as an NGO, we had explored every possibility for eradicating corruption as well as reform rotten systems in the state administration,” Vanlalruata says in a freewheeling conversation at their party office in Aizawl. Since its formation in 2006, PRISM had taken up PIL cases and submitted FIRs against corrupt officials on many occasions. “But even after providing the government with proof and documents, they took no action against anyone, nor did they listen to our suggestion for administrative reforms. Hence, we have to jump into politics to continue our fight as the government is protecting corrupt officials and has no real interest in development -- 90 percent of the state’s budget goes in salaries of government employees leaving less than 10 percent for development activities. Which is what we have not seen progress under any of the parties who have been in power,” he says. Vanlalruata argues that even if some political leaders favour development, they are unable to do so as they do not know how to change their bad systems. Which is what PRISM, the political party, hopes to change. “Like the symbol and what it stands for, the way a prism reflects light, our party will reflect the good assets of Mizoram, its cultural heritage and natural beauty,” he says. In fact, Vanlalruata and his party colleagues searched for the right words to name the party in order to retain the acronym PRISM. For the upcoming Assembly polls, the party president is confident that the membership drive which enrolled more than a lakh of people and the other work they had done as an NGO will enable them to get a good percentage of votes. Their target groups are unemployed youth and senior citizens. He feels the party’s approach will not appeal much to the middle-aged, especially government employees and businessmen. Hence the big focus on youth who, he feels, will react positively to the emphasis given in the party manifesto on creating employment. They also intend to frame better welfare schemes for senior citizens. The party manifesto also continues to emphasise the earlier objectives of fighting corruption and reforming the administration, which the party is hopeful will resonate with sections of voters. So far, the party has announced 13 candidates and will nominate 12 more, for the 40-strong house. Many of their candidates will be new faces in Mizoram’s political arena. “As a political party we would like to form the new government,” Vanlalruata admits, adding “even if we do not perform as well as expected, it is only the beginning of our political journey, we will go all the way until the fight is won.” Vanlalruata does not rule out working with like-minded groups after the polls but said there will be no pre-poll arrangement with anyone. Vanlalhruaia, PRISM’s candidate from Tuirial constituency says that when he campaigns in villages, he does not dole out money like other candidates as “all candidates start practising corrupt acts even before the elections, by bribing and duping the people with money. PRISM will refrain from such practices"". PRISM youth president RL Liantluanga at a press conference on Wednesday said that their party will make life hell for the corrupt and a paradise for the honest and the poor. Liantluanga, the candidate from Hrangturzo constituency says he had visited several villages accompanied by his vice president H Lalremsiama and has high hopes given the good response from the people. “Some candidates contest just because they want fame and fortune for themselves,” says Liantluanga. “Their main job is to badmouth other parties as they have no proper policies for progress and development to show to the people.”",2018-11-06,"Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Politcs,PoliticsDecoder,PRISM,States,Vanlalruata",Mizoram polls: PRISM transforms from NGO to political party with anti-corruption plank after attempts at activism fail,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-prism-transforms-from-ngo-to-political-party-with-anti-corruption-plank-after-attempts-at-activism-fail-5508091.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Confident of winning his fourth term as chief minister of Chhattishgarh, Raman Singh has said the state polls might have some impact on the Lok Sabha election next year but it should not be seen as a referendum on the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. Singh, who has ruled Chhattisgarh for 15 years, also dismissed any impact of Congress president Rahul Gandhi's promise of farm loan waivers in his state on the upcoming Assembly election, saying farmers here have already been given zero-interest rate loans. The 66-year-old BJP veteran, who was a practising ayurvedic doctor before taking the plunge into politics in 1980s, told PTI in an interview that there is a ""pro-incumbency"" wave in the state on the basis of the work his government has done in the agriculture sector and the effective functioning of the public distribution system. The Opposition leaders have been talking about a strong anti-incumbency wave against Singh, who has been the chief minister of the state for three consecutive terms. Many political pundits have also called the upcoming assembly polls in five states — Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram — as semi-finals before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make his bid for a second term with his party, the BJP, eyeing to project him as a nation-wide mascot of the party. Among the five states, Chhattisgarh is the first to go to polls in two-phase voting. The voting will take place for a total of 18 seats of Chhattisgarh assembly in the first phase on November 12, including for Singh's own Rajnandgaon constituency, while the remaining 72 seats in the state will go to polls in the second phase on November 20. The counting for all 90 seats will take place on December 11, along with the same for the four other states. Voting will take place in Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram on December 28 and in Rajasthan and Telangana on December 7. In Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the ruling BJP is pitted directly against the Congress, even as the presence of the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party's alliance with former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi's party has made the contest more interesting in that state. Besides, the Congress's plan to forge a broad-based anti-BJP alliance has failed to fructify fully in all poll-bound states. Exuding confidence that the BJP will win this time, Singh said the state polls may have ""slight impact"" on next year's Lok Sabha election. However, the state polls should not be seen as a referendum on the Modi government, the three-term chief minister said. Modi got a thumping majority in 2014 Lok Sabha election, while Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were among the states where the BJP had won in a big way. Singh is leading the BJP's bid to form the government in the state for the fourth straight time. The Congress was in power in the state only during the first Assembly, after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh. With Maoist violence back in limelight, the Opposition leaders in their campaign rallies have been accusing the Raman Singh government of failing on the security front. Singh said it would be his priority to ensure peace in the Bastar region if voted to power again. The entire Maoist-affected region would go to polls in the first phase, including Singh's Rajnandgaon Assembly constituency, which is known as his bastion. Singh said Jogi's presence has made the state elections three-cornered this time, but it does not look as difficult as it was last time. ""I would say, the last Assembly election was the toughest one, when many Congress leaders were killed in Maoist attack in the Darbha valley,"" he said, adding that his government was questioned at that time over the Maoist situation in Bastar. On Salwa Judum, Singh said the movement emerged due to anger among people towards Naxals, which is still there but such movements could not last long. In 2011, the Supreme Court had ordered disbanding of the anti-Maoist force after calling it illegal and unconstitutional. Salma Judum was mobilised in 2005 by the late Congress leader Mahendra Karma, who was killed by Maoists in 2013, as a vigilante force against the left-wing extremists. While many had described it as a spontaneous uprising of tribals against the violence in the Bastar region, it had acquired a controversial reputation with allegations that the state administration supplied them arms and helped them recruit untrained locals as 'special police officers'. They were also accused of burning villages, assaulting people and forcing them out of their homes. In the 2013 election, the BJP got 49 seats while the Congress secured 39. The BSP got one. The Congress, however, improved its vote share to 40.29 percent, compared with 38.63 percent and 36.71 percent in 2008 and 2003, respectively. The BSP got 4.27 percent of the total votes cast in 2013, down from what it got in 2008 and in 2003.",2018-11-06,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,Bastar,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Lok Sabha Election,Madhya Pradesh,Mahendra Karma,Maoists,Mizoram,Narendra Modi,Rajasthan,Raman Singh,Telangana","Assembly elections not referendum on Modi govt, may have some impact on Lok Sabha polls next year, says Raman Singh",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/assembly-elections-not-referendum-on-modi-govt-may-have-some-impact-on-lok-sabha-polls-next-year-says-raman-singh-5511321.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The option to resolve the Ayodhya dispute through community dialogue is ""over"" and the BJP will work towards the construction of a Ram temple here through constitutional or legislative means, the party's Faizabad district chief said on Tuesday. Diwali celebrations in the holy city of Ayodhya this time is taking place in the shadow of the Ram temple debate as the chorus has grown within the party and the Sangh Parivar for the construction of a temple at the Ramjanmabhoomi through an ordinance. Faizabad BJP president Awadhesh Pandey claims that majority population of Ayodhya want to see the temple being built as it is a ""matter of faith"" for them and the ""BJP is the only party that raises this issue for them"". ""The chorus for bringing ordinance to build it is growing and the BJP will take a legislative route or one that is within the framework of the Constitution. The option of resolving the issue through community dialogue is now over (batchit se masla hal karne ka rasta khatma ho gaya hai),"" Pandey told PTI. He said there was a community dialogue option earlier and the court had also given an opportunity, but it ""did not work out"". ""We reach out to people to feel their pulse at ward level, and they want that Ram temple should be built,"" the district BJP chief claimed. Asked if the Muslim community wanted the same, his response was muted. Many BJP leaders, including Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, have been pitching for speeding the work towards construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya in western Uttar Pradesh, and some of them, including Union minister Vijay Goel, have suggested taking the ordinance route. Asserting that a Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya soon, Adityanath said on Sunday in Haridwar a piece of good news regarding this awaited devotees all over the country. The echoes of the controversial issue can be felt during the 'Depotsav' celebrations here, with Adityanath likely to announce a plan for the installation of a huge statue of Lord Ram on the banks of the Saryu river here. ""Yogiji is most likely to announce Tuesday, during 'Deepotsav', the plan for erecting a 151-metre statue of Lord Ram on the banks of Saryu. The place has not been finalised and it will be done after soil testing,"" Ayodhya Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay told PTI. South Korean First lady Kim Jung-sook, accompanying a cultural delegation, will attend grand Diwali celebrations here, which includes a dazzling display of lakhs of diya at Ram ki Paidi. The Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, an umbrella body of Hindu seers, in New Delhi on Sunday had ""directed"" the Narendra Modi government to bring in a legislation or an ordinance to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The Supreme Court recently fixed the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute cases for the first week of January next year before an appropriate bench, which will decide the schedule of hearing. A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, had said the appropriate bench would decide the future course of hearing in January on the appeals filed against the Allahabad High Court verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case. As many as 14 appeals have been filed against the 2010 High Court judgement that suggested that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land be partitioned equally among three parties — the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.

While, JD(S) has closed in on two seats, Congress has managed to capture two others and BJP has managed stronghold only in the Shimoga Lok Sabha constituency. Congress has lapped up Bellary and Jamakhandi, whereas JD(S) has managed to secure Mandya and Ramanagara. Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha Kumaraswamy won from the Ramanagara constituency with 1,25,043 votes and by a margin of 10,9137 votes.

Debobrat Ghose,"The reputation of Ajit Jogi as a political mastermind dwarfs his achievements as a politician. So when Jogi, the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh and now the founder of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) party, decided to launch his own outfit and decided not to partner with any major party in the state, it was a sign of worry for the latter. No one clearly knows  , the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Congress. By deciding to fight the upcoming elections with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as an ally, Jogi has certainly left the competition jittery. Speaking to  , Jogi, who despite quitting the Congress two years ago continues to enjoy a national recall, unlike other leaders in the Congress, reveals his stand on matters that concern Chhattisgarh and on other parties. Here are excerpts from the interview: The Congress not giving a ticket to Dr Renu Jogi is an internal matter of their party, so I won't comment much on this. However, I would just like to mention that it's part of the ""ABJ"" (Anybody But Jogi) strategy of the state unit of the Congress that has been in practice since 2003. I had been trying to persuade Renu to join my party, but because of her family relations with Sonia Gandhi, she had been with the Congress for the past two and a half years. What can be a bigger testimonial to her loyalty for the Congress than the fact that she put her affiliation with the party much above the husband-wife relationship? Yet the Congress could not recognise her dedication for the party and also tried to separate her from Kota, which is just like family to her. She cannot be isolated from Kota, which is why she is  . It's an ironical situation that the Congress has a number of chief ministerial aspirants but does not have a single face that can be projected in Chhattisgarh. All their so-called leaders are confined to their own constituencies. This is definitely working to their disadvantage. As goes the famous saying, too many cooks spoil the broth. We saw this situation earlier in 2008 and 2013, when all the so-called chief ministerial aspirants lobbied before the high command for the top post just before the results. But when the results were declared, these aspirants did not win even their own seats. As far as my party, rather my alliance, is concerned, we are not concerned with this as it is an internal matter of the Congress.  . The Congress has become irrelevant. We are committed to uprooting the Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh. Rather than considering the vote share (which reflects the overall votes for a party in the entire state), you need to look into the constituency-wise votes that the BSP has been getting in all the elections. As India follows the ""First-Past-the-Post"" electoral system, what matters is the constituency-wise votes, not the overall vote share. If we look at the Assembly-wise votes the Congress and BSP secured in 2003, 2008 and 2013 elections, it is clear that combining them could have secured them a majority in these elections, which clearly indicates that the BJP would not have come to power at all in Chhattisgarh. The Congress has become irrelevant now. People don't have any hope from the Congress, and that is why they have been voting for the BJP, despite the misrule of the Raman Singh government. Now, they have a clear cut alternative before them with our alliance. This alliance will help to synergise the strengths of the JCC and BSP, and also of the Communist Party of India (CPI) in the Bastar region and the industrial belts of Chhattisgarh due to the presence of their labour union, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). Our coalition with the BSP is not just of two parties but of the meeting of two hearts that beat as one. The biggest testimony to this fact is that my daughter-in-law, Richa, is contesting on the BSP symbol. In a nutshell, I would say that the Government of Chhattisgarh has failed on all three sectors related to the common man — health, education and security. When I say security, it includes women's security, financial security, food security, the increasing crime rate and the Maoist problem. The underlying reason for this is incompetence and rampant corruption. To elaborate, I would like to cite a few examples that clearly indicate the failure of the Raman Singh government in its 15-year tenure: - Despite 30 lakh unemployed youth in Chhattisgarh, jobs are being given to outsiders. - The government is running the business of selling liquor, but is closing schools in the name of rationalisation. - Farmers have not been given their promised minimum support price (MSP), which is forcing them to commit suicide. - A once power surplus state is becoming power deficit, but at the same time, the government is selling power to other states. - Businessmen are facing a slowdown because of wrong policies, especially demonetisation and the poor implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. - Human trafficking and crimes against women are on the rise. - A dominant bureaucracy and prevalence of rampant corruption prevails in Chhattisgarh. The chief minister himself has been asking his party workers and leaders to stop the business of commission for the past year to be able to rule for 30 years The list is endless. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are the only states in India where there are no regional parties yet. This election will change the scenario in Chhattisgarh. Now, the people of Chhattisgarh will no longer have to depend on Delhi or Nagpur to make decisions. All their decisions will be made in Chhattisgarh. This government will be ""of the people of Chhattisgarh, by the people of Chhattisgarh and for the people of Chhattisgarh"". The Maoist problem cannot be tackled by bullets. There is a famous saying: ""An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind."" It applies in this case. The Maoist problem can be resolved through dialogue, by involving them in the political process. That is what happened in Nepal. We need socio-economic development; we need to give them education and employment and orient them to a good lifestyle.",2018-11-06,"Ajit Jogi,Ajit Jogi BSP Alliance,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Congress,CPI,Maoist,QandA,Raman Singh,Renu Jogi","'Congress irrelevant in Chhattisgarh, BJP a failure': Ajit Jogi tells Firstpost only option is a JCC-BSP coalition govt",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-irrelevant-in-chhattisgarh-bjp-a-failure-ajit-jogi-tells-firstpost-only-option-is-a-jcc-bsp-coalition-govt-5509731.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"A scuffle broke out between the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari, his supporters and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers at the inauguration ceremony of the Signature Bridge in Delhi. BJP workers alleged that AAP had not invited Tiwari to the ceremony even though it was Tiwari who had started the efforts to push for the construction for the structure in his North East Delhi constituency. Tiwari, however, claimed that he was invited to the event but was stopped from attending it. ""I was invited to the inauguration event. I am an MP from here. So what's the problem? Am I a criminal?

Press Trust of India," Likening the RSS and the BJP to Manthara and Kaikeyi respectively — the characters from epic Ramayana — the Congress on Friday accused the two organisations of consigning Lord Ram to ""exile"" for the last three decades. At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the two organisations ""think of Ram only before elections"". The RSS, earlier on Friday, said that an ordinance would be needed if all other options for constructing Ram temple in Ayodhya were exhausted. ""RSS is the Manthara and BJP the Kaikeyi who have exiled Lord Ram for the past three decades,"" Surjewala said here, invoking the characters from Ramayana who scheme to send Ram, the hero of the epic, into an exile in the forest. ""They remember Ram only before elections,"" he said when asked about Congress' views on BJP MP Rakesh Sinha's announcement that he will introduce a private member's bill for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. ""Why Congress should react to an assistant lecturer's (Sinha) announcement? He is not the prime minister or BJP chief or home minister or law minister,"" Surjewala said. Sinha, a BJP nominated member to the Rajya Sabha, is also an assistant professor at the Motilal Nehu College of the Delhi University. To another question, Surjewala termed the Congress as ""Pandavas"", the virtuous five brothers of the Mahabharata.

In his complaint, Delhi BJP leader Rajeev Babbar alleged that Tharoor with ""mala fide intention made the statement which is not only abuse of the Hindu deity but also defamatory"". He also said that being a vice president of the Delhi state BJP, he was ""identified as a worker/ supporter of Narendra Modi and BJP"" and that Tharoor's statement hurt his religious sentiment. The complaint termed the statement as ""intolerable abuse"" and ""absolute vilification"" of the faith of the people. ""The speech of the accused had lowered down the credit and image of the complainant. The complainant was hurt and anguished as the intentional, defamatory and mischievous statement of the accused has lowered the reputation of the complainant in the eyes of others present there,"" the complaint said.

The accused had deliberately made the statement intending to harm, knowing and having reason to believe that such false statement will harm the reputation of the workers/supporters of Narendra Modi and BJP,"" the complaint said.

Asked whether he felt the criminal defamation suit against him ""is an attempt to throttle his voice"", the Congress MP said, ""Apparently it seems so.""

""So, why has this defamation suit been filed against me now? In my book, I as a writer had quoted 5,000 other examples and stories,"" he said. ""The fact is that environment of free expression, the liberty to quote what has been said at one time or another about prominent political personalities in a respectable publication (has been compromised).

Tharoor said he did not believe that he had done anything wrong or out of the ordinary and any author would have felt free to quote such published material in writing. ""I have also quoted Modi's (sic) authorised biography by Andy Marino quite extensively.

The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had ""shocked the BJP so much"". He said, ""Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said."" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the ""saddest day of his life"". ""Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?"" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. ""A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,"" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that ""the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a  "", but went on to add, ""to my mind arguing that point is academic."" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, ""I have said as much as I wanted to say.""",2018-11-04,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Ayodhya,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Congress,LK Advani,NewsTracker,Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid,Ram Mandir Agitation,Ram Mandir Dispute,Shashi Tharoor",'Build Ram in your heart': Congress' Shashi Tharoor says no Hindu text condones use of violence to get one's way,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/build-ram-in-your-heart-congress-shashi-tharoor-says-no-hindu-text-condones-use-of-violence-to-get-ones-way-5502471.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Union minister Uma Bharti on Sunday said while Hindus were the ""most tolerant"" people in the world, any talk of constructing a mosque on the periphery of a Ram temple in Ayodhya could make them ""intolerant"". The minister also invited Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to lay the foundation stone of the temple in Ayodhya with her, saying he would ""atone for the sins"" of his party by doing so. ""Hindus are the most tolerant community in the world. I will appeal to all politicians: please don't make Hindus intolerant by talking about building a mosque on the outer periphery of the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya,"" Bharti told   in an interview. She said when there could not be a temple in the holy town of Medina or a mosque in the Vatican City, it would be ""unfair"" to talk about a mosque in Ayodhya. Describing the Ayodhya dispute as one of land and not faith, the firebrand Hindu leader said, ""This is now only a matter of dispute of land, not dispute of faith. It has been resolved that Ayodhya is the birth place of Lord Ram."" She also stressed the need for an out-of-court settlement of the contentious issue, and urged all political leaders — including Gandhi, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, BSP leader Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee — to support this. ""We need support of all political parties on this issue. I invite all leaders including, Rahul Gandhiji, come let's lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple with me,"" Bharti said. By doing so, the Gandhi-scion could atone for the past sins of the Congress, which always created ""hurdles"" in building the temple in Ayodhya, she said. SP supremo Mulayam Singh, Banerjee, Mayawati and the Left parties should support the BJP on this issue as it is of national interest, she said. ""But they aren't letting the matter get resolved. The Congress will have to quit the habit of dividing the country in the name of religion,"" Bharti said, reiterating that all political parties should unite on this issue. Bharti, who had participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1990s, said she was fully committed to the construction of Ram temple.

Press Trust of India," The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Sunday announced its second list of 17 candidates for the polls to the 230-member state Assembly slated for 28 November. The party since Saturday has declared the names of 172 candidates for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections. Of the 17, four candidates are for reserved seats. The names of Congress state unit chief Kamal Nath and poll campaign committee in-charge Jyotiradtiya Scindia are not on the list. They are touted to be frontrunners for the chief minister's post if the party wins. The first list of 155 names was released late Saturday night and it includes that of 21 women and 24 fresh faces. It has struck a fine balance between supporters of Scindia and former chief minister Digvijay Singh, sources said. The party, on expected lines, renominated 46 MLAs while dropping Govardhan Upadhyay, Shakuntala Khatik and Manoj Kumar, sitting MLAs from Sironj, Kerera and Kotma respectively. They have been replaced by Ashok Tyagi, Jaswant Jatav and Sunil Saraf. Interestingly, the Congress has nominated Dr Hiralal Alawa, convener of the tribal political outfit Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS), from the Manawar seat in Dhar district. Alawa, a former assistant professor at Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences, was unavailable for comment. The Congress-JAYS were in talks for an alliance, especially in the Nimar-Malwa region where the BJP has a formidable following. Former chief minister Digvijay Singh's son Jaivardhan, a sitting MLA, brother Lakshman Singh and nephew Priyavrat Singh have been given tickets from Raghogarh, Chachoda and Khilchipur seats respectively. Similarly, Scindia loyalists Hemant Katare and KK Singh have been nominated from Ater and Jaora seats respectively. Four former MPs, comprising former Union minister Suresh Pachouri, Vijaylaxmi Sadho, Sajjan Singh Verma and Surendra Singh Thakur have been nominated from Bhojpur, Maheshwar, Sonkuth and Sehore respectively. Leader of Opposition in the state and son of former chief minister late Arjun Singh, Ajay Singh will fight from Chruhat. Sanjay Sharma, Padma Shukla and Abhay Mishra, who recently joined the Congress after leaving the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, have been given tickets as well. The party has fielded Chandra Prakash Ahirwar from Guna (reserved) Assembly seat and Ram Niwas Rawat from Vijaypur. The Congress is expected to announce the remaining candidates shortly, a party leader said. The BJP stole a march on the Congress Friday by releasing its first list of 177 candidates for the assembly polls, fielding Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan from Budhni seat.

Press Trust of India,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday termed ""nonsense"" his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal's claim that stubble burning in Punjab was solely responsible for the high pollution levels in the national capital, and wondered if the AAP leader can ""really"" be an IIT graduate. Taking a dig at Kejriwal for his ""preposterous"" logic that the satellite pictures of stubble burning in Punjab was proof of it being the primary cause of the Delhi's severe pollution, he said even a school kid would know better. ""Can he (Kejriwal) really be an IIT graduate?,"" asked the Punjab chief minister. In a statement, Amarinder Singh presented certain figures to rubbish Kejriwal's ""ludicrous"" claims and asked the Delhi chief minister to stop indulging in ""political theatrics"" and check facts before blaming Punjab. The Punjab chief minister said the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi remains more than 300 even during December and January every year, when there is no stubble burning in the neighbouring states. This clearly indicates that the national capital's air quality is impacted by its own sources, which are predominantly vehicular emission, construction activities, industrial activities, power plants, burning of municipal solid waste and sweeping activities, Singh said. Terming Kejriwal's comment as yet another attempt by the Delhi chief minister to divert public attention for his own government's ""abysmal failure on all counts,"" Singh alleged, ""Having failed to deliver on governance to the people of the national capital, the chief minister was, as usual, trying to take refuge in falsehoods and fabrications."" Singh also said according to the latest report on air pollution by the India Meteorological Department, winds over Delhi-NCR had changed from north-westerly to easterly, so there was hardly any influence from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. ""Yet, Delhi's air quality continued to be 'very poor', with an average PM2.5 concentrations of 208 microgrammes per cubic metres on 2 November, which was caused mainly from local vehicular and industrial emissions, he claimed. ""What is more, the increase in concentration of PM2.5 due to stubble burning is proportionately less as compare to PM10. Thus, the contribution of stubble fire in the increase of PM2.5 is less, whereas, the Ambient Air Quality in Delhi witnesses an increase in the PM2.5 during the winter months,"" the Punjab chief minister observed. In particular, Delhi's AQI crosses the 400 mark due to high emissions from activities of a large population in a confined area of NCR and inversion phenomenon of the climate. During October, the wind velocity became static and decreased to less than 2 km/hr, Singh said, referring to available scientific data. He asserted that had stubble burning been the reason for Ambient Air Quality deterioration then it should have impacted the air quality index of cities in Punjab in the first place. The data clearly indicated that Arvind Kejriwal's government had ""failed""completely in addressing the problem of pollution in the national capital, Singh said, adding the Delhi chief minister was, ""quite obviously, hunting for scapegoats to put the blame for his own failures"". The Punjab chief minister warned that the people of his state would not take politely the AAP leader's attempts to pin the blame for his own ""failures"" on their state.

""Chhattisgarh ranked 20th in the list of 21 states for providing health services, and posts of doctors and nurses were lying vacant,"" the Congress leader said. ""The chief minister has dashed the hopes of people who were thinking that health facilities would improve after a doctor became chief minister. Health facilities are pathetic in Chhattisgarh,"" Babbar said in a press conference in Raipur. ""A doctor chief minister has pushed the state's health services into the ICU during his 15-year rule,"" Babbar alleged. He said the Raman Singh government had failed to build a single hospital in Bastar region for security forces getting injured in anti-Naxal operations. ""These injured jawans have to be airlifted to Raipur or require admission in private medical facilities,"" he added.

He refuted BJP allegations, made on several occasions, that the Congress was ""backing"" Naxals. ""The Congress party had lost its state leadership (in Naxal attack in May 2013).

Addressing a rally in Taraud village in the Akaltara constituency in Janjgir-Champa, the BSP chief alleged that both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress had worked towards making reservation ""ineffective"" and were trying to gradually ""abolish"" it.

Now, the incumbent BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have failed to fully comply with the quota norms as provisioned in the reservation policy. A similar situation is prevailing in Chhattisgarh as well,"" the BSP chief said. She also accused the Congress and the BJP of having an ""internal nexus"" to make reservations in job promotions for Dalits and tribals ""ineffective up to a great extent"". Mayawati further said the BSP had fought for reservation inside Parliament and on the streets, apart from running a campaign for the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission to ensure a quota for the OBCs.

Sandipan Sharma,"Sachin Pilot’s rise in Rajasthan’s politics once again proves the moral of the parable of the hare and the tortoise. For four years, he worked slowly and steadily on the ground and suddenly emerged as the front runner in the race for the state’s chief ministership. Every pre-poll survey in Rajasthan, where Assembly election is scheduled to be held on December 7, has indicated Pilot is the first choice of the electorate. His popularity ratings are believed to be even higher than Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and his own senior colleague, former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, the two stalwarts of Rajasthan politics. Four years ago, when he lost Ajmer Lok Sabha seat, nobody could have foreseen Pilot’s rise in politics. He was primarily seen as a Delhi leader with very little following among the masses. In a polity defined by caste equations, his Gurjar base was believed to be a major handicap because of the community’s low electoral clout. Within the party, he had to compete with Gehlot and former Union minister CP Joshi, who was once Rahul Gandhi’s trusted lieutenant and strategist. Outside, he had to deal with the label of a being a paratrooper and a beneficiary of dynastic politics. But opinion polls and the buzz on the ground suggest he has overcome these obstacles and turned some of his liabilities into assets. Sanyam Lodha, a former Congress legislator, says Pilot has risen in Rajasthan because of several factors. One, he has got an extended run — almost five years — as the state Congress chief. This allowed him to build his own network and connect with the masses by virtue of being the face of the Congress. Two, he used this tenure to travel extensively and mobilise the party. Three, he is seen as suave, articulate and charismatic. “Young voters like him, they think he is modern and progressive,” says Lodha. Pilot’s caste has also become an advantage. Since he is a Gurjar, the so-called politically powerful castes like Jats, Rajputs and Brahmins consider him to be neutral. Unlike Gehlot, who has little acceptability among the Jats, Pilot is acceptable even to castes and communities that fight with each other for a greater share of power. Former Congress MLA Pratap Singh Khachariawas, whose uncle Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was one of the giants of Rajasthan’s politics, says Pilot’s steady rise and acceptability shows voters no longer get swayed by caste and community considerations, especially in urban areas. “There was a vacuum in the state because of Raje’s fall in popularity. Pilot presented himself as a viable alternative by consistently challenging her on the ground. Voters remember just his struggle,” argues Khachariawas. Amidst growing speculation that he could be the next CM of Rajasthan if the Congress wins the Assembly election, Pilot will have to deal with two obstacles. One, the BJP’s ploy to axe most of its sitting legislators to counter anti-incumbency. Two, the popularity — fading but still significant — and ambitions of Gehlot. The BJP’s internal surveys have indicated that at least 100 of its current MLAs have become unpopular. The BJP high command is planning to replace them with new faces to augment the party’s electoral prospects. Raje too is wary of anti-incumbency but she doesn’t want such large-scale changes, fearing the exit of many of her loyalists. But, if the BJP gets its plan rolling, it might help the party take on the Congress, though some argue the anger is more against Raje than the party. Gehlot is a bigger challenge for Pilot because of his proximity to the Congress high command and his track record. Many surveys suggest people still remember his previous tenure as a success story. Also, among the party cadre, his acceptability is high. Who gets to the helm of the Congress in case it wins the assembly polls would depend on two things. One, Rahul Gandhi’s ability to read the outcome and use it strategically for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. He would have to decide who would suit the Congress more as CM — Gehlot or Pilot. If he prefers a seasoned campaigner to steer the state, Rahul Gandhi may back Gehlot. But, if he wants to balance caste equations and signal a fresh beginning, Pilot may be the party’s choice. The other factor would be who dominates the ticket distribution process. If Gehlot loyalists outnumber Pilot’s in the Assembly, they might demand a secret ballot for choosing the leader. But, Congress insiders say, the party is dealing with this by letting Rahul Gandhi take the final decision on candidates. The only criterion would be a candidate’s winnability predicted by his own team of psephologists and observers on the ground. If that happens, it is advantage Pilot.",2018-11-02,"Ajmer Lok Sabha Seat,Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,Bhairon Singh Shekhawat,BJP,Brahmins,Congress,Gurjar,Jats,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Politics,Rajputs,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan polls: Despite Ajmer debacle in 2014, Sachin Pilot leads Vasundhara Raje, Ashok Gehlot in race to CM post",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-despite-ajmer-debacle-in-2014-sachin-pilot-leads-vasundhara-raje-ashok-gehlot-in-race-to-cm-post-5493211.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Renu Jogi, wife of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, on Friday announced that she will contest the upcoming state Assembly election from Kota as a candidate of her husband's party. The announcement comes after the Congress released its final list of candidates on Thursday and her name was missing from it. Former police officer Vibhor Singh has been fielded from Kota in Bilaspur district by the Congress. Miffed over the party's decision, Renu filed her nomination papers from Kota as the candidate of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J), a political party launched by her husband Ajit Jogi in 2016. ""I had full faith in the Congress and (UPA chairperson) Sonia Gandhiji. I have been a committed and dedicated worker of the Congress party,"" she said. ""But for the last two-and-a-half years, I was pained to see the treatment (by party leaders) towards me,"" Renu told reporters after filing her papers at Bilaspur collectorate. Asked whether it was painful for her to quit the Congress, Renu replied in the affirmative, but maintained that there is a possibility they will be part of the ' ', a possible grand alliance of Opposition parties that is being talked about to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. ""Finally, when I was denied ticket, I thought I was being insulted. Therefore, I quit the party. I have been connected to the people of Kota during my entire life (as a politician) and this will continue,"" she said. ""Today, I filed nomination from the party of my family JCC (J) and am confident that I will win,"" she added. Interestingly, Ajit Jogi has so far never hinted that his fledgling outfit will be part of any anti-BJP grand alliance at the national level. Renu was accompanied by her son Amit Jogi, the sitting MLA from Marwahi constituency, while filing her papers. This time, Ajit Jogi will contest from Marwahi. After she was denied ticket, Renu, in a letter to Sonia Ganhi, had explained how she was being ignored by the present Congress leadership in the state. In the letter, she wrote that she was removed from the post of deputy leader of opposition in the assembly and local Congress leaders tried to tarnish the image of her husband and son through ""fake"" CDs. Despite all this, Renu said she continued to be a loyal soldier of the party. Ajit Jogi's party, the JCC (J), has forged an alliance with the Mayawati-led BSP and the Communist Party of India (CPI) for this month's elections. He has been nominated as the chief ministerial candidate of the three-party coalition. In 2015-16, a feud ensued between the Jogi family and the local Congress leadership over an audio tape containing conversations about the 2014 Antagarh bypoll. In the wake of the row, the Congress had expelled Amit Jogi from the party. Later, Ajit Jogi quit the Congress and floated his own outfit. Elections to the 90-member Chhattisgarh Assembly will be held in two phases on November 12 and November 20. The counting of votes will be held on 11 December. In the 2013 Assembly polls, the BJP had won 49 seats, the Congress 39, the BSP 1 and Independent 1.",2018-11-08,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,India,Kota,NewsTracker,Politics,Renu Jogi",Chhattisgarh election 2018: Ajit Jogi's wife to contest polls as nominee of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-election-2018-ajit-jogis-wife-to-contest-polls-as-nominee-of-janata-congress-chhattisgarh-5495301.html,firstpost,-1,0
K Nageshwar,"Chandrababu Naidu has emerged as the new messiah of  . However, his political somersaults in the past, and the inherent contradictions within the Opposition camp, make the exercise of forging this unity an arduous one. Naidu has never been consistent in his choice of allies. The manner in which he first embraced and later   is an illustration of this. Besides, Naidu, who now talks about a Common Minimum Agenda to counter the Narendra Modi-led government, was the most avid supporter of the saffron party's economic agenda like demonetisation, the push for a cashless economy, GST, etc. The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, who was in the NDA at that time, described demonetisation as a far-reaching measure that would have a salubrious effect on the country's economy. A look at the more distant past also offers a similar picture. The TDP, which earlier had an alliance with the Left parties, switched its loyalties to extend life support to the first NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, the TDP chief threatened to pull out of the NDA citing the 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat during the chief ministership of Narendra Modi. Later, calling his alliance with the BJP a historical mistake, Naidu led an alliance of the TDP, TRS and the Left parties in 2009, only to join forces with the BJP again in 2014. After four years of bonhomie with the BJP, during which Naidu praised Modi’s leadership several times, the TDP suddenly took yet another U-turn, purportedly on the issue of denial of special status to Andhra Pradesh, and left the NDA. This resulted in a belligerent fight between the TDP and BJP, only to facilitate the former’s alliance with the Congress. However, perhaps Naidu’s inconsistency does not matter much for other Opposition parties, as most of them have been a part of the same game for all these years. NCP chief  , speaking to the media after meeting Naidu, said that a meeting of Opposition leaders will be called soon to chalk out the future course of action. The drafting of a common minimum programme will be done after discussions among like-minded parties. It is considered better for parties to join a coalition based on a pre-election agenda which has been agreed upon. However, Opposition parties lack a consensus on many issues. Recently, Pawar had come to the rescue of Modi at a time when Congress president Rahul Gandhi had been attacking him over alleged corruption and cronyism in the Rafale deal. The NCP chief, in an interview to a Marathi channel, stated that people ""do not have doubts"" over Modi's intentions regarding the deal. He went on to say that the Opposition's demand that technical details about the fighter jets be shared “made no sense.” Although the NCP   that Pawar had not given a clean chit to the prime minister, the damage to Opposition unity was already done — on an issue which is likely to be an important one ahead of the 2019 election. While Amit Shah welcomed Pawar’s statement, two senior NCP leaders left the party, aggrieved by their leader’s statement. Even as Naidu intensifies his efforts to stitch together a grand alliance of non-BJP parties, the BSP has moved away from the Congress ahead of the Assembly elections, which are being seen as a semi-final for the Lok Sabha election. This division in the Opposition’s ranks benefits the BJP. Mayawati appears to have changed her stand despite a united Opposition having defeated the BJP in by-elections in Uttar Pradesh earlier this year. This is precisely why BJP general secretary and master strategist Ram Madhav exuded confidence that some parties that have joined the Opposition alliance could well find themselves in the NDA after the 2019 polls. His statement, which came on a day when Naidu held hectic parleys with several Opposition leaders, is a significant one. In fact, historical trends of the behaviour of non-Congress and non-BJP parties, barring the Left, support his assertion. The manner in which Nitish Kumar walked out of the mahagatbandhan to join hands with the BJP is characteristic of the political fragility within the Opposition grand alliance. The TDP, TMC, AIADMK, DMK, JD(S), BSP etc, have, at various times, switched their alliance partners keeping in mind perceived political advantages to them. However, TDP leaders are presently busy portraying Naidu as someone who can make and unmake national politics. However, the fact remains that Naidu has not been able to bring any NDA partner into the Opposition fold. The parties with which Naidu has been holding discussions are already in the anti-BJP camp. These parties have been responding to anyone and everyone who makes an effort towards Opposition unity, of course, with their own caveats. However, the speed and magnitude of Naidu's effort is certainly noteworthy. This time, at least there is talk of bringing together all non-BJP parties into a nationwide front and formulating a common agenda. This is the new element in the Opposition unity exercise. However, the myriad contradictions and the varying political compulsions at the state level and the competing claims of electoral quotas make such an exercise difficult, if not impossible. Given the opportunistic nature of Indian political alignments and realignments, nothing certain can be said on what the scenario will be after the election.",2018-11-02,"BJP,Chandrababu Naidu,Mahagathbandhan,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,PoliticalPlay,Rafale,Rahul Gandhi,Sharad Pawar,TDP,Telugu Desam Party",Chandrababu Naidu's past political somersaults make his credentials as messiah of Opposition unity suspect,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chandrababu-naidus-past-political-somersaults-make-his-credentials-as-messiah-of-opposition-unity-suspect-5495001.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," A day after the BJP candidate announced that he had withdrawn from Ramanagara Assembly bypolls, the party on Friday petitioned the Election Commission requesting it to ""annul"" the 3 November election immediately as the poll process has been ""vitiated"". The BJP also demanded that leaders of Congress-JD(S) coalition, including Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, be booked under relevant provisions of law for allegedly acting in ""collusion"" to ensure that there is no contest. In a major embarrassment for the BJP, two days before the Ramanagara assembly bypoll, L Chandrashekhar, its candidate against Kumaraswamy's wife, quit the contest Thursday and returned to the Congress. With the BJP candidate withdrawing, Anita Kumaraswamy is expected to have smooth sailing. In its petition to the Commission, the BJP alleged that the developments are the ""convergence of undue influence"" practised by Chandrashekar, Congress' Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh, Anita Kumaraswamy and the chief minister. ""Hence, it is also a convergence of fraud, and horse-trading of a candidate."" ""We request you to kindly book cases against them under relevant provisions of the Law for offences against elections under section 171 of the IPC and for undue influence and corrupt practices under the Representation of People Act,"" the party said. ""Further, we request you to annul the elections immediately and forthwith and restore the faith of people in democracy,"" it added. Chandrashekhar, son of senior congress leader CM Lingappa, had joined the BJP as the Congress decided to support the candidate of its ruling coalition partner JD(S). Within days of joining the BJP, he was announced as the party's candidate for the bypoll. In the petition submitted to Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar by party MLC and spokesperson Ashwath Narayan along with others, the BJP said Chandrashekar's act interferes and violates the ""free and absolute right"" of BJP voters to cast their votes. It said as the officially nominated BJP candidate withdrew and joined the Congress, there is no BJP candidate and even though there is a name on the ballot paper, it is merely a show piece as the candidate himself has left the BJP and joined the Congress. ""When the candidate has left the BJP and joined the Congress, his name in the voters ballot as BJP candidate has no meaning. Therefore, the entire election process is vitiated,"" it added.

Press Trust of India," Actor and Jana Sena party president Pawan Kalyan on Friday slammed Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababdu Naidu for allying with the Congress, terming it as ""politics of convenience"" and said it has ""killed the Telugu self-respect."" The coming together of the Telugu Desam Party and Congress was not even for benefit of TDP or Andhra Pradesh, he claimed. ""In fact, the TDP-Congress alliance has caused a sense of deep hurt and killed the Telugu self-respect."" ""It is not even for the benefit of the TDP or Andhra Pradesh,"" Kalyan said. He said he differed with his own brother, former Union minister K Chiranjeevi, when the latter joined the Congress only to protect the state's interests. ""We have to safeguard our self-respect. Our stand should, hence, be in a measured manner,"" he added. Aiming to forge an anti-BJP front ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Naidu on Thursday met heads of several Opposition parties, including Rahul Gandhi, and termed his party's alliance with the Congress a ""democratic compulsion"" to protect the country. In an informal chat with newsmen on board the Janmabhoomi Express proceeding to Tuni from Vijayawada Friday, Kalyan claimed that there was no chance of realignment of political parties in the state in the wake of the TDP's move. ""There is no chance of a realignment (of parties). What Chandrababu Naidu did was only to protect his (political) existence. If any realignment happens...from our side, it will be for the sake of the people,"" Kalyan asserted. ""When I supported the TDP (in 2014), majority of people agreed with me. Rather, I echoed their thoughts. But now, (safeguarding) power is their ultimate objective while our aim is bringing about a change,"" he said. Asked about the general feeling that he might again support the TDP, post-2019 elections, he remarked that people have a right to think like that. ""I can't help it,"" he said, stressing that he would not indulge in politics of deception. ""Our party will never do it. Whatever I do, I will be open about it,"" he asserted. ""I will officially announce if there is anything,"" he added. On the TDP-Congress alliance, the actor likened it to the hype prior to the release of a movie. ""During a film's pre-release, there will be a lot of advertisement that its going to become a big hit. Eventually, however, it will end up as a failure. Thats how we look at it,"" he said. ""Deep down, in the long term, it's only politics of convenience but it has caused a deep hurt,"" Kalyan observed. Alleging that the two national parties (Congress and BJP) had always ""looked down at us"", Kalyan said he always wanted to be wary of them. ""There should be no slavery (to the national parties),"" he added. Kalyan said there was seething anger among youth and they were seeking an alternative, not opportunistic politics.

She said she can work for people's welfare by implementing central government schemes. ""I am asking what did he (Owaisi) do for you (people)? What change has come in your lives? What about your children's education and how many of them are employed? How many have become engineers and doctors,"" she told  . A communal atmosphere prevailed in the old city of Hyderabad, AIMIM's stronghold, and there has been no change in the lives of common people, including ordinary Muslims, with AIMIM at the helm, she alleged. Owaisi has been elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. Dismissing allegations that BJP is a communal party, she said such a mindset has been established that the organisation was opposed to Muslims. It is the BJP which made the late APJ Abdul Kalam the President of India and BJP's Muslim leaders like Sikandar Bhakt, Najma Heptulla and M J Akbar held important positions, she said. Budget has been increased for Maulana Azad Urdu University in Hyderabad and for madrassas in Uttar Pradesh under a BJP government, she claimed. Having studied in government schools and colleges, Shahezadi said, she understands poverty, public issues and the issues concerning Muslim women. She thanked BJP's leadership for making her the candidate though she does not have money power. ""If there is any party which encourages youth, it is BJP. It is BJP which encourages Muslims also. Because, I am the example,"" she said. BJP's Telangana unit president K Laxman said Shahezadi can expose the ""misdeeds of AIMIM and how they are exploiting poor Muslims."" Shahezadi hailed the Modi government's decision on triple talaq issue and she wants to work for empowerment of the Muslim women, he said.

Press Trust of India," About 6 percent of the electorate cast their votes Saturday in the first two hours of polling for the by-elections to three Lok Sabha and two assembly constituencies in Karnataka. While the Lok Sabha constituencies of Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya recorded 7.16 percent, 4.4 percent and 4.18 percent voting respectively till 9 am, Ramanagara and Jamkhandi assembly constituencies have recorded 7.34 and 9 percent polling. Voting began at 7 am and will go on till 6 pm. There are a total 31 candidates in the fray in all the five constituencies, though the contest is mainly between the Congress-JD(S) combine and the BJP. Counting of votes will be on 6 November. The Congress and the JD(S), which have come together in a post-poll alliance after the assembly elections in May this year threw up a hung House, are facing the polls unitedly against the BJP, which they perceive as their common enemy. While the Congress has fielded its candidates in Jamkhandi and Ballari, the JD(S) is contesting in Shivamogga, Ramanagara and Mandya under an electoral understanding. A total of 1,502 polling stations have been declared as sensitive, election officials said. A total of 35,495 polling personnel are on duty for the bypolls in which 8,922 voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) will be used, they said. The outcome of the bypolls is expected to have a bearing on the alliance between the Congress and the JD(S) for the 2019 polls. The BJP, which has been questioning the longevity of the coalition government, has predicted its fall once the bypoll results are out. Among the prominent candidates in the fray is Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy's wife Anita Kumaraswamy, who is expected to have a smooth sailing. She is facing a virtual no-contest in Ramanagara after BJP nominee L Chandrashekhar  , in a jolt days before the polls. The BJP had lodged a complaint with the Election Commission about the developments in Ramanagara and requested it to ""annul"" the elections immediately. In Jamkhandi, Congress candidate Anand Nyamagowda, the son of former MLA Siddu Nyamagouda, is pitted against Srikant Kulkarni of the BJP.In Shivamogga, state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa's son BY Raghavendra is testing his fortunes against another former chief minister S Bangarappa's son Madhu Bangarappa of the JD(S). In Ballari, senior BJP leader Sriramulu's sister J Shantha is fighting against VS Ugrappa of the Congress, considered an outsider. In the Vokkaliga bastion of Mandya, JD(S)'s Shivarame Gowda, is pitted against a fresh face in Dr Siddaramaiah, a retired commercial tax officer from the BJP. The by-elections have been necessitated after Yeddyurappa (Shivamogga) and Sriramalu (Ballari), and C S Puttaraju of JD(S) (Mandya) resigned as MPs on their election to the assembly in May this year.

Abdullah said the three of them will now ""work out a common minimum programme"", and that Naidu will be speaking to various state leaders to unite the parties that can take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This is Naidu's second visit to New Delhi in less than a week, as part of efforts to to bring anti-BJP parties together. Naidu, along with TDP parliamentarians Jayadev Galla, CM Ramesh and others,  , who said they were coming together ""to defend democracy and the future of the country"". At the joint press conference, Naidu said that as senior leaders of the country, they felt sorry for the current state of India as it is ""facing so many problems, and the situation is deteriorating day by day"". Therefore, Naidu said, the three of them had met to "" "". ""This great nation has given us so much. We have to protect its future. The nation is all we're interested in. They have instructed me to talk to all anti-BJP parties to chalk out a programme. That is why I am here,"" Naidu told reporters.

Today, democracy is in danger, and the nation's people are in danger."" The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, however, emphasised that he does not wish for ""power"" or ""seats"", only for the welfare of the nation. Naidu ""coincidentally"" also met senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi and briefly discussed the need to bring all non-BJP political parties together, TDP sources said.

FP Staff,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw open the world's tallest statue to celebrate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and dedicated it to the citizens of India, Opposition parties questioned the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party as to why didn't they think of a bigger statue for Mahatma Gandhi. The Opposition also accused the ruling party of trying to ""hijack"" the legacy of Independence heroes like Sardar Patel. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, taking a jibe at Modi, said it was ""ironic"" that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being destgroyed while BSP chief Mayawati demanded an apology from the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh who flayed her over the statues of Dalit leaders her government had installed in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul also alleged that the ""systematic destruction"" of India's institutions is nothing short of ""treason"". Modi after unveiling the 182-metre structure in his home state of Gujarat on Patel's 143rd birth anniversary addressed the criticism of the decision to build the monument, questioning whether any crime had been committed by constructing such memorials for national heroes like Patel. ""We are criticised for praising the contributions of national heroes like Sardar Patel. We are made to feel as if we have committed a serious crime,"" he said. He then posed a question to the audience, ""You tell me, is it a crime to remember our national heroes?"". To this, the audience replied in the negative. The Statue of Unity is built in dedication to Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who served as the first home minister of independent India. Sardar Patel is credited with uniting all 562 princely states in pre-independent India to build the Republic of India -- hence the name of the statue. The date for the inauguration of the statue (31 October, 2018) also marks the 143rd birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. The Statue of Unity will be open to the public from 3 November. Activist Medha Patkar penned an   and criticised the fact that lands of adivasi labourers was being encroached upon to build this statue. In the letter, ""Can you imagine who has built your new avatar? Many Chinese and some local Adivasi and national labourers have worked overnight on the ‘Sadhu Bet’, a hillock with Adivasi deity of their faith. You would surely ask, on whose land would this statue stand? Whose plan was this? This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to Adivasis. The very same people your government and then leaders, Mahatma to Pandit Nehru recognised as villagers with rights, as republics and offered security through Panchsheel. The forefathers of the Indian Constitution, with Babasaheb at the helm, also granted them right to peace and good government, through the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and later, the PESA Act towards self-reliance."" Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said there was no such gigantic statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the country and wanted to know why BJP had not built a bigger statue for him. ""The biggest one is in Parliament..But this is a 182-metre statue for his disciple. Why is there such a big statue for a disciple of Gandhiji in the country where there is no statue of that size for the Mahatma?"" he asked while addressing a function at the district congress committee office in Thiruvananthapuram. CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy also echoed Tharoor's sentiments. ""Patel, a very simple person, was known as the disciple of Gandhiji,"" Tharoor said. ""I am asking a question...Is it right to erect such an imposing statue of Patel, a man of simplicity and a true Gandhian, who moved along with poor peasants,"" he said. Tharoor said BJP had no answer to the query why they did not erect a bigger statue of the Mahatma. The reason is that they do not believe in Mahatma Gandhi's principles of non-violence, he alleged. He also alleged that BJP was trying to ""hijack"" the legacy of freedom fighters and national heroes like Patel as they have no leaders of their own in history to celebrate. He said Patel was a Congress leader and BJP should not be allowed to adopt him. Rahul said Patel was a patriot, who fought for a independent, united and secular India. ""A man with a steely will, tempered by compassion, he was a Congressman to the core, who had no tolerance for bigotry or communalism...,"" he tweeted. Mayawati accused the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) and its government at the Centre of confining Patel to a region, saying this is an example of BJP's “narrow-mindedness”. ""All those in the BJP, the RSS and company need to apologise, especially to the people of the Bahujan Samaj, for terming the statues installed by the then BSP government to honour icons like Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others as wasteful expenditure,"" she said in a statement released in Lucknow. ""The people of the country are also wondering if all this is not politics, and if the BJP really had this love for Patel why had they not put up such a massive statue earlier in Gujarat where they are in power for a long time,"" the chief of Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP) said. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge slammed BJP for using the statue of Sardar Patel for their ""vested interests."" BJP remembering Patel was an ""election gimmick"", Kharge told reporters at Hubballi in Karnataka. The Congress leader said, ""Every year BJP remembers a different freedom fighter--sometimes they remember Patel, sometimes Gandhi for Swachch Bharat Abhiyan and sometimes they remember Dr B R Ambedkar and Subhas Chandra Bose. These are all their election stunts. They never had respect for those who fought for the freedom of India."" ""Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister while Patel was Home Minister. Naturally credit goes to the prime minister. It is not good to project somebody to undermine somebody else,"" Kharge said. Reddy, the CPI chief, demanded to know why a bigger statue of Mahatma Gandhi was not built by the BJP. He said while there was no objection over the monument built for Patel, what was surprising was why a bigger statue for the father of the nation, who was also born in Gujarat, was not thought of. ""They (BJP) do not like his (Gandhi's) secularism, that is why they have not taken up (build his statue). Instead, they have gone for Patel, who had rightist ideas,"" the CPI general secretary alleged. Reddy also charged the BJP with trying to ""appropriate"" the legacy of Patel. ""We have no objection to Sardar Patel's statue. With all due respect to him (Patel), we feel Mahatma Gandhi is the tallest leader of Indian politics...Indian people...he is the father of the nation,"" he told PTI in Hyderabad.

Press Trust of India," Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray Thursday dared the BJP to claim that the promise of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya was a ""jumla"", asserting that it will go down from ""280"" Lok Sabha seats to two if it did so. Further attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said the bricks collected for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh were in reality not for the temple but steps that took it to power. Thackeray was addressing Sena workers at Mahad in Raigad district, near Mumbai. The Sena and the BJP are allies in the governments in Maharashtra and at the Centre, but have constantly been at loggerheads over a host of issues. ""The bricks that were collected for Ram Mandir were in reality not for the temple, but were the steps to take you (BJP) to power. Say once that (the construction of) Ram Temple was a jumla and you will be reduced to two seats from 280 (in the Lok Sabha),"" the Sena president said. The ruling party currently has an effective strength of 272 members in the Lok Sabha. The BJP has often been derided by other parties for its poll promises that brought it to power in 2014, which they claim were nothing more than election rhetoric or ""jumla"". Thackeray said the fight had now begun in the run-up to next year's Lok Sabha polls, adding that the politics and the prevailing environment in the country were on a downslide. ""The 2019 polls are fast approaching. I am not concerned about what will happen (to political parties), but about what will happen to the people and the country,"" Thackeray said. He rued that neither inflation had decreased nor employment increased after the BJP came to power with a majority in the 2014 polls, adding that people were grappling with a ""strange"" environment prevalent in the country. Thackeray asked the party workers to go among the masses and ask them if they had received the benefits of the schemes of the Narendra Modi government. In another veiled dig at the BJP, the Sena chief said he was not for garnering votes after making false promises. He added that while he was touring the state to take stock of the drought situation, Prime Minister Modi was busy with his foreign tours. ""Maharashtra should get a Sena chief minister this time, I will tour the state to ensure that. The government has declared a drought, but when will drought relief measures be provided?,"" he asked, taking a swipe at the Devendra Fadnavis-led state government, of which his party is a constituent.

Press Trust of India," Welcoming the Supreme Court's order to the Centre to submit details of pricing of the Rafale fighter jets India is buying from France, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged on Thursday that the Narendra Modi government has tried to ""cover up"" its secret and dishonest activities in the multi-crore defence deal. Alleging that the Rafale deal was an example of cronyism and corruption, Yechury said he was hopeful the truth about the deal will come out as the apex court has insisted on facts. ""The Modi government has tried to cover up its shenanigans in the Rafale scam by providing all kinds of excuses. With the Supreme Court insisting on facts, the truth about this prime example of cronyism and corruption will fully come out,"" he tweeted. The government has denied allegations of corruption in the deal. The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre for pricing details of the 36 Rafale jets India is buying from France in a sealed cover within 10 days but agreed that ""strategic and confidential"" information need not be disclosed. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi gave some leeway to the government, which has argued that pricing details are so sensitive that they have not even been shared with Parliament. The court was hearing four petitions, including one by advocate Prashant Bhushan and former ministers Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha who are seeking a court-monitored CBI investigation into the purchase of the fighter jets. The court posted the matter for hearing on 14 November. India signed an agreement with France for 36 Rafale aircraft in a fly-away condition as part of the upgrading process of the Indian Air Force equipment. The Rafale fighter jet is a twin-engine Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft manufactured by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation.

Sanjay Singh,"Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha’s announcement on Twitter that he intends to introduce a “private member's bill” in Parliament on Ram temple is an unlikely decision that was taken in isolation given the timing of the tweet and his profile. In the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Sinha was “nominated” by the Narendra Modi government to the Upper House. The Delhi University associate professor, founder of India Policy Foundation and biographer of RSS founder KB Hedgewar has for long been seen as a public face of the Sangh on various television channels. After being nominated under Article 80 of the Constitution, Sinha joined BJP and official website of Upper House refers to him as a BJP member. His announcement came just a day after Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya on beginning of the   (ABKM) said that the Centre should enact a law and construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the way Sardar Patel had done for the construction of Somnath temple. The RSS Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Arun Kumar spoke about the need for a government made Ram temple on Wednesday. The RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had talked at length about it at his Vijayadashmi speech in Nagpur. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) is demanding the same. As a BJP member, Sinha couldn’t have made this move without due deliberation and consent from the party leadership. The Rajya Sabha member also sought the response from Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Yadav and Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu. However, BSP chief Mayawati did not figure in the list.   Sources said the Ram temple issue was informally deliberated at length among the senior leaders in the government and in the BJP’s organisational structure. The parleys attempted to chart out a way so that sincerity on the Ram Mandir issue could be maintained in the public eye and also not to earn judicial ire in the process. The consultation also focussed on how to prevent the Opposition from exploiting the Ram Mandir issue just ahead of the string of Assembly polls in key states and the General Election in the first half of next year. There is a fear that the BJP might walk into an ambush if it engages itself in a hot pursuit of the Ram Mandir issue allowing the Opposition an opportunity to accuse it of keeping its development plank in the backburner.  Since the matter is pending before the Supreme Court and the hearing is adjourned till January and also the constitution of a new bench to hear the title suit, the government coming out with either an ordinance or a bill on Ram temple may not augur well for the Narendra Modi government. There is a possibility that the apex court may take an adverse view of any such move. Pro-Mandir groups had been critical of the Supreme Court’s decision to postpone hearing in the case to next year. Moreover, even if the BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha it does not have the required numbers in Rajya Sabha. Some of the current allies of the BJP may have taken a different position and given an impression that there is a deep division in the ranks of the ruling NDA on the issue. This is a perception which the BJP would prefer to abstain from just ahead of the parliamentary election. The decision to field someone from its own rank for moving a private member's bill will give an impression to its core social constituents and also to the sympathisers that it is sincere about the construction of Ram temple. It would keep the pot boiling and let the public debate on the subject. But at the same time for any adverse fall out on the issue either in the court or inside Parliament or anywhere else, the move would ring-fence the government. Even as it stands behind Sinha’s move the government has positioned itself in such a way that it could always borrow Manmohan Singh’s words if the need be and say it was keeping at “arm’s length”. This could be a smart political tactic by the BJP leadership. But there are technicalities involved in moving a private member's bill. Since the time allotted for moving a private member's bill is very limited a lottery is held to decide which member’s bill would be taken up. Once it is through the lottery and date allotted, the Chair seeks the House's permission to allow that bill to be introduced. Members in the House respond in “Ayes” and “Noes” and there could be a voting also if it is not clear in the voice vote. If Ayes wins then the discussion on the bill begins. In the next Winter Session, there could be one or two occasions when a private member's bill is taken up. Sinha and the BJP will have to first wish his notice gets past lottery. The catch lay not in the voting for passage of the bill but at the introduction stage itself — that it will make it clear who stands where — whether the Congress with Rahul Gandhi’s newfound identities of  .. and “ ” is for Ram Mandir or not. The same yardstick would apply for parties like RJD, NCP, SP, TMC and others who are currently siding with the Congress.

FP Staff,"Divisions in the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress came to light on Thursday, after party leaders Digvijaya Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia engaged in a verbal spat in the presence of party president Rahul Gandhi. Singh and Scindia, who have been asked to pick winnable candidates for the upcoming polls in Madhya Pradesh slated for 28 November, sparred over ticket distribution and choice of candidates,  reported. The news channel also reported that the spat was intense enough for Rahul to commission a three-member committee, comprising Ashok Gehlot, Veerappa Moily and Ahmed Patel, to resolve it. They sat in the party's war room at Gurudwara Rakabganj Road in New Delhi till 2:30 am on Thursday to resolve the matter. Later in the day, Singh on Twitter   that any argument took place between him and Scindia. He said, ""It is being wrongly reported in the press that I and Jyotiraditya Scindia ji had any argument and Rahul ji had to intervene. All of us in the Madhya Pradesh Congress are one, and determined to defeat the corrupt BJP government in Madhya Pradesh."" The row comes amid reports that the Congress has been unable to decide on a   for the upcoming state polls. Scindia and veteran leader Kamal Nath are unofficially considered to be the Congress' chief ministerial candidates. Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said his party has not declared its candidate in Madhya Pradesh as part of its poll strategy while showering praises on Nath and Scindia. ""Both our leaders have qualities of their own. Kamal Nath, the Madhya Pradesh Congress president, has vast political experience and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Congress chief whip in the Lok Sabha, is young and energetic,"" Rahul said. The Congress is looking to unseat the BJP, which has been in power since 2003, in the election scheduled for 28 November. The party's president Rahul Gandhi has been extensively touring the state in a bid to revive the party's fortunes. However,   in the party's state unit and an inability to forge an alliance   have dealt it a blow. Meanwhile, two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh has slowly taken a backseat in the state and has kept himself away from the party affairs ahead of Assembly polls. , Singh is not happy about being overlooked by his party. A letter that he allegedly wrote to Sonia Gandhi, complaining about being ignored by the party, also came to light on Thursday. In the letter, he also asks for tickets for 57 candidates, terming them ""dedicated workers of the party who are not aligned with any party faction."" Singh took to Twitter to refute reports that he wrote the letter. reported that the BJP accused the Congress of engineering the plot. “A seasoned politician like Digvijay Singh uploaded the letter on his own Twitter handle proves that he wanted the content to be known to his followers and the party,” BJP spokesperson Rajnish Agrawal said, claiming it’s Singh’s “ ” and “whether it’s fake or not is a different thing.” Responding to the allegations, Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said Singh has himself clarified that the letter is fake, so the issue should be put to rest. “We can understand that the BJP is unnerved due to fear of losing the forthcoming Assembly polls and the letter is a creation of Dirty Tricks Department of the BJP,” taunted Chaturvedi. Recently, Singh also stayed away from the Congress' programmes in Ujjain and Indore, saying that he he had been assigned an important work by the party president.

Karishma S," In the past three Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, BJP has maintained its hold on Sendhwa—a constituency 150 kilometres from Indore—courtesy internal disputes in Congress and rebellions among its workers. So much so that if one Congress leader gets a ticket, the competitor allegedly directs all his votes to the BJP candidate. The two contenders for a Congress ticket in Sendhwa, Gyarsilal Rawat and Sukhlal Parmar, have been at loggerheads, leaving the seat out of reach of the grand old party since 2003. What is thus ironic is the locals' claim that Sendhwa is favourable ground for the Congress—in terms of electorate—due to its candidates' tribal connection. Two communities contend for the seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes: Barela and Bhilala. The claimants, Rawat and Parmar, who hail from the Barela community are engaged in a bitter rivalry. BJP’s Antar Singh Arya managed to bag this seat in 2003 with 32,000 votes because of this feud. “Because of internal politics and groupism, the seat went into BJP’s hands,"" said Sukhlal Parmar, former president of the Barwani district Congress committee. ""If Sendhwa Congress leaders join hands, we will easily win this seat. In 2013, the party gave a ticket to a weak candidate."" The Rawat-Parmar rivalry gained such notoriety that in 2013, the Congress award the Sendhwa ticket to an entirely new face: Dayaram Bata. President of Krishi Mandi (a farmer’s market), Bata was given the ticket against popular expectant Bhuvan Singh, whom the state leadership had readied. Congress leaders in Delhi cancelled Singh’s ticket after being informed about a rape charge against him and asked state leadership to replace him the same day. Since Bata was not a known face, BJP secured an easy win. However, Rawat is extremely confident of securing a ticket this time around. “There were some issues in the past, but we are all together now and will definitely win the elections this time,” he said. As per locals, Arya and Rawat emerged as influential leaders after they were given tickets in 1990. Rawat gained prominence in the mainstream after emerging victorious in college elections. He, however, lost that election to Arya by 3,907 votes. In 1993 and 1998, Rawat played his cards well, bagging the seat with a margin of 6,472 and 3,083 votes, respectively. The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh was dissolved in 1992 in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid riots. However, in the early 90s, when Parmar, a businessman working with the Congress, moved to Sendhwa, a new political dimension emerged. After he failed to bag a Congress ticket in 2003, Parmar contested the elections with NCP’s backing and managed to swing a significant number of votes (24,078). He lost by a narrow margin, but secured almost as many votes as Rawat, who lost to Arya by over 30,000 votes.  In 2008, Parmar pushed Rawat aside to bag the Congress ticket from Sendhwa. Which resulted in Rawat retaliating by directing his vote bank, the Barela community, towards Arya, who won by a margin of 12,818 votes. According to locals, Arya and Rawat belong to the Barela community and are distant relatives. While the Congress was expected to release its first list of candidates for Madhya Pradesh polls Wednesday—which it still hasn't—it will be interesting to see how the party handles the gridlock in Sendhwa, which seemingly hurts its candidate's chances. Talking about the incumbent’s chances in Sendhwa, BJP district president S Veera Swami, said, “The party and MLA has done a lot of work in these years for farmers, youths and the locals, and I am sure this year we will win by a margin of 40,000 votes. There might be some problems in Congress, but BJP has always been a strong party. For Arya, there's no contest.”",2018-11-01,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Polls,MP Polls,Sendhwa",Madhya Pradesh polls: Clashing Congress candidates may open door for BJP in Sendhwa constituency yet again,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-polls-clashing-congress-candidates-may-open-door-for-bjp-in-sendhwa-constituency-yet-again-5489271.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The ruling AIADMK Thursday flayed rebel leader TTV Dhinakaran for saying it would ""struggle"" to secure deposit in the bypolls to 20 Assembly seats, including those of the 18 disqualified party MLAs, and said those in the rival camp were in a ""confused state of mind."" It said Dhinakaran's statement showed how much the family of deposed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala, including Dhinakaran, was ""against"" former Chief Minister J 
Jayalalithaa. On Wednesday, Dhinakaran had said in Madurai that the 18 disqualified MLAs will not appeal against the Madras High Court verdict upholding their disqualification, as decided by them originally, and face the elections, seen as a U-turn by his critics. AIADMK ridiculed Dhinakaran for his volte-face and said the disqualified MLAs were in a ""confused state of mind."" ""They have perhaps decided against appealing since it is clear that they might not win the case in the Supreme Court. Two judges (of the Madras High Court) had upheld the disqualification,"" party spokesperson RM Babu Murugavel, also an advocate, told  . Dhinakaran had exuded confidence that his Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) will trump the AIADMK in the bypolls. ""We are not going for an appeal. We will be facing the polls... AMMK will secure a grand victory in all 20 seats and AIADMK has to struggle to even secure deposit,"" he had said. While the 18 segments have fallen vacant following the disqualification process, two other seats - Thiruvarur and Thirupparankundram, are also vacant due to the death of the respective MLAs, then DMK chief M Karunanidhi, and AK Bose of the AIADMK. Opposition parties, including DMK, have demanded that bypolls should be immediately held for all 20 seats. Earlier, following the 25 October High Court order upholding their disqualification by Speaker P Dhanapal in 2017, the MLAs had decided to move the apex court, after 
holding consultations with Dhinakaran in Madurai. The Madras High Court had upheld the 14 June order of the then chief justice disqualifying them. Justice M Sathyanarayanan had heard the pleas of the rival parties after a bench of then Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar gave a split verdict on 14 June. On Thursday, Murugavel took exception to Dhinakaran's remarks that AIADMK would 'struggle' to secure deposit in the 20 Assembly seats if bypolls were held there. ""When he himself says that AIADMK will lose deposit, it shows how much they (Sasikala's family) were against the party and  ,"" he said. Jayalalithaa is addressed as   by party supporters. To a query, he said his party was prepared to face the polls anytime. This was evident from the fact that it had recently named election in-charge for all 20 seats, including AIADMK coordinator and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, for the respective segments.

Press Trust of India," Two days after the Congress announced the induction of former BJP leader Gulab Singh Kirar into the party in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, the Opposition party ""disowned"" him on Thursday after realising that it had targeted him in connection with the Vyapam scam earlier. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is watching with glee the Congress's discomfiture over Kirar, an Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader, in the run-up to the high-stakes Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls, scheduled to be held on 28 November. The saffron party said Kirar had no association with it and his cross-over to the Congress will have no bearing on it. On 30 October, the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress had announced the induction of Kirar into the party in Indore in the presence of party chief Rahul Gandhi and other leaders. ""In the presence of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, BJP MLA from Tendukheda Sanjay Sharma, ex-MLA Kamlapat Arya and Gulab Singh Kirar got membership of the Congress. Welcome to Congress family,"" the Madhya Pradesh unit of the party had said in a tweet. However, the tweet was deleted shortly afterwards. Ostensibly scrambling for cover over the flip-flop, the Congress on Thursday clarified that Kirar was never inducted into the party. ""Kirar did not join the Congress on Tuesday. We have not given him membership. He was putting up in a hotel where Rahulji (Gandhi, who was on a two-day tour of the state on 29-30 October) had stayed and was thus, seen around (Gandhi) that day in Indore,"" state Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza told  , when asked if the party had disowned Kirar over his alleged involvement in the Vyapam scam. Addressing a public meeting at Khargone on 30 October, Gandhi had alleged that the ""family"" of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was involved in the Vyapam scam and said he was ready to face defamation cases for his remarks. The Vyapam scam, which was unearthed in 2013, allegedly pertains to fraudulent practices in conducting professional exams and making appointments for government jobs through the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB). The Congress has made ""corruption"" under the Chouhan government its main poll plank in Madhya Pradesh. When contacted, Kirar said he was a Congressman earlier too before joining the BJP. He said he had returned to his parent party on 30 October. ""I returned to the Congress-fold in Indore on Tuesday. I shook hands with Rahulji, Kamal Nathji (state Congress chief) and Jyotiraditya Scindia (state Congress campaign committee chief) and became a member of the Congress once again,"" he claimed. Asked about his experience in the BJP, Kirar said, ""I was under the impression that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan would work for the betterment of his Kirar community."" Kirar said he decided to return to the Congress because Chouhan had ""failed"" to work for the community. The Congress had hit out at the chief minister in early 2015, when he shared the stage with Kirar at a function of the OBC community at Raisen after the Vyapam FIR was lodged. Kirar is a former member of the Madhya Pradesh Backward Classes and Minority Welfare Commission and enjoyed the status of a Minister of State in the state government till his expulsion from the BJP in 2015, when he was named by the CBI in an FIR linked to the Vyapam scam. According to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Kirar and his son were involved in alleged irregularities in the entrance examination conducted by Vyapam — an acronym for the Madhya Pradesh Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal — for post-graduate courses in medicine in 2011. When contacted, state BJP spokesperson Rajnish Agrawal said Kirar had no association with the ruling party. ""Kirar has not been with us and his cross-over to the Congress will have no bearing on us given that the chief minister is from the same community as that of Kirar's and is popular among his community members,"" he said.

K Nageshwar,"Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu's anti-Modi crusade reached a new level of propulsion on Thursday, as he joined Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and National Conference president Farooq Abudallah in a bid to unite all the parties opposed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The two senior leaders   that have a common agenda to forge an anti-BJP front in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The three leaders also decided to consult other like-minded parties to chalk out a common minimum programme. Before meeting Pawar and Abdullah, the TDP chief had also called on Aam Aadmi Party president and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati. However, Naidu is neither the first, nor will he be the last, leader to take up such a crusade to unveil a third or federal front. In fact, the Congress itself has attempted to forge Opposition unity, with Sonia Gandhi having invited leaders of non-BJP parties in the past. But as several outfits have their own reservations and political interests in accepting the leadership of the Congress, nothing substantial can emerge at least before the 2019 polls. So far, attempts to unite non-BJP or anti-BJP parties have yielded mixed results. The united fight by the Samajwadi Party, BSP, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Congress   in Uttar Pradesh. However, despite the critical importance of unity between the Congress and BSP to dislodge the saffron party in its strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, nothing of that sort could materialise. Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) supremo and Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) was yet another leader who had tried to unite regional parties. However, as he met only a select group of politicians who were either part of the Congress-led alliance or likely allies of the party, political circles began to view KCR's intentions with suspicion. Some even believed that KCR was doing this at the behest of the Modi-Shah duo to harm the Congress — the common enemy — by preventing other regional parties from gravitating towards the Grand Old Party. Trinamool Congress president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was yet another important leader  . But given the fact that she  , her competitors within the regional spectrum, including Pawar and even the Congress, were always sceptical. On all these occasions, regardless of who made the attempt, the parties with political compulsions to oppose the BJP responded positively. Yet, a front and common minimum programme still elude because of inherent contradictions in the non-BJP camp. However, Naidu was candid when he said that political compulsions will force non-BJP parties to come together to form a third front against it. Mulayam Singh Yadav's national ambitions were almost laid to rest with the crisis in the Samajwadi Party. Also, with the gradual weakening of the BSP in its own state Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati's national ambitions were hard hit, as well. After these experiences to unite the Opposition, Naidu has now made a fresh attempt to forge a front to take on the BJP, and to undertake this exercise, he certainly has a number of advantages. For one, Naidu is no longer with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and has shed his pathological aversion towards the Congress, against which TDP founder NT Rama Rao had floated the party. Naidu seems to be best suited to bring the Opposition together against the BJP, given his experience with the Congress when he brought together the 13-party United Front in 1996-1998, as well as with the BJP-led first NDA government. Leaders like Pawar, Mamata and Mayawati do not consider Naidu a contender anymore, especially since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. The united state had 42 seats in the Lok Sabha, while the current Andhra Pradesh — where Naidu's politics have been restricted to primarily — has only 25 seats in the Lower House, much lower than Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal or Maharashtra. On one hand, the Congress is bound to have reservations about Pawar and Mayawati as their NCP and BSP are its competitors in the states where it has much at stake, and the same holds true in Mamata's case. On the other hand, however, the Congress has been decimated in Andhra Pradesh because of the alleged arbitrary bifurcation of the state. This means that it desperately needs Naidu for its revival in Andhra Pradesh. Naidu, too, is keen on embracing the Congress due to the electoral arithmetic at play since he walked out of the NDA and his fallout with Pawan Kalyan and his Jana Sena Party. However, retaining power in Andhra Pradesh is paramount for Naidu, even more than the national political odyssey, as he has to install his son Nara Lokesh. But people close to Naidu have yet to dismiss his national aspirations, especially as his son, who is a minister in his cabinet, is all set for political succession. Although Naidu has national ambitions, his Delhi parleys are primarily aimed at enhancing his strength in Andhra Pradesh through the electoral arithmetic. With  , the TDP has made a strange, yet remarkable, turn in its historical destiny. The Andhra Pradesh chief minister has intelligently posit his political interest in the state in the national framework to avert any possible antipathy towards his alliance with the Congress at home. The TDP had won the 2014 election with only a 2 percent margin with the support of the BJP and Pawan Kalyan. As both parties are now estranged, the TDP is desperately looking even for an incremental addition to its votes to avoid a possible flip-flop. However, given the anti-Congress sentiments in Andhra Pradesh on the basis of the narrative around the bifurcation, which Naidu nurtured himself all these years, the TDP wants to carefully couch his new-found love for the Congress in an anti-BJP national perspective.",2018-11-01,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Anti-BJP,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,Mamata Banerjee,Mayawati,Non-BJP,Opposition,Opposition Alliance,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Sharad Pawar,Third Front,United Front","Chandrababu Naidu seems best suited to forge anti-BJP front, but he won't be last to attempt Opposition unity",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chandrababu-naidu-seems-best-suited-to-unite-opposition-but-he-wont-be-the-last-to-attempt-to-forge-anti-bjp-front-5488381.html,firstpost,-1,0

Pragya Singh,"With less than a month to go for the Assembly election, Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS) is all set to add a new corner to Madhya Pradesh's traditional bipolar politics. The new socio-political outfit, led by former AIIMS doctor Hiralal Alawa, joining the electoral contest symbolises the inclination among marginalised communities that national parties are failing them. JAYS represents a stirring among tribals in pockets of Madhya Pradesh similar to what the Dalits of Uttar Pradesh experienced in the 1980s. Dalits rejected mainstream political outfits of their state to spawn the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as they felt it would better represent their interests. ""We tribals lost political relevance despite our numerical strength because we could never combine,"" says Alawa. ""Now, we are saying, '  because from Madhya Pradesh's 47 seats reserved for tribals, we can defeat any outfit. Along with the backward classes, Dalits and Muslims, we want to join the mainstream and seek leadership in political parties."" JAYS epitomises the dissatisfaction among the tribal population with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as the Congress. Alawa and his followers believe that both parties have failed to nurture effective tribal leaders. Their grievance is that the existing ones toe their party line far more than work for the community. As a result, Alawa wants tribals to stop flip-flopping between the two big parties. ""We told the Congress and BJP that they cannot stroll into Adivasi areas during elections, play the drums and take our votes,"" says Alawa, whose party has been making waves in Madhya Pradesh ever since it secured 162 posts in the 2017 student body elections. ""In their higher echelons, both parties lack noteworthy tribal leaders. The Congress does not have even a single big tribal leader."" Unlike the Dalits of Uttar Pradesh, who are spread across the state, the tribals in Madhya Pradesh live in scattered pockets. Nevertheless, they constitute 21 percent of the population, which is why Alawa feels empowered. His JAYS started as a social movement in 2012, but was soon fatigued by conventional means of redress. ""Dharnas and rallies didn't solve our problems. We spent money fighting court cases, but nothing changed. So we realised that unless we gain political strength, we will be like other activists who come to Bhopal, petition powerful people, but ultimately get nothing,"" says Alawa, who is now proposing a new idiom of economic and cultural rights in tribal regions, not limiting their assertion to politics. ""Tribals depend on forests for sustenance, but the Forest Rights Act was never implemented since 2007,"" he adds. ""If Adivasis oppose their land being taken for projects, they are branded Maoists."" Unrest over land acquisition was the primary reason why Alawa's motivational work found appeal among the youth in Fifth Schedule areas. In these regions, tribal representatives are supposed to sign off on development projects, but it is the contention of JAYS that this has not been happening. It wants ruling parties to stop installing their members in tribal advisory councils. In Madhya Pradesh's Alirajpur district, many workers returned home from mines in Gujarat with lung silicosis, while sickle cell disease and fluorosis are rampant. This has primed the tribal population to oppose development as often envisaged by the dominant parties. ""People here can see the flip side of development as well,"" Alawa says. In Dhar, Khargone, Ratlam and Alirajpur, basic needs such as irrigation, a medical college and rail connectivity are still unavailable. A recent United Nations report found that development indices here are comparable with that of Sierra Leone, one of the least developed parts of Africa. ""Thousands of crores were spent under tribal sub-plans, but we still live in India's most backward zones, malnourished and hungry,"" Alawa says. Culturally, too, Alawa marks a distinction between tribal and mainstream aspirations. Where the Congress is taking a leaf out of the BJP's Hindutva playbook and projecting leaders as caste Hindus who obsessively pray in temples, JAYS is more accommodating and keen to preserve traditional forms of tribal worship. With this comes a growing distaste for mixing religion with politics. ""Gonds don't have a religion as such, while Bhils worship their forefathers. They are not Hindu but have adopted some Hindu practices. They feel that both the BJP and Congress politicise religion, which they dislike,"" Alawa says. A majority of tribals believe in independent forms of worship, excluding many rituals they consider superstitious or dogmatic. At the same time, JAYS neither has no caste or religious base, nor has it been fomenting such rivalries, which the mainstream parties are struggling to deal with. ""At our Kisan Panchayat on 20 October, we assured Muslims in writing that tribal youth will not let themselves be used by the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) in riots,"" Alawa says. His platform has also made space for   — Anand Rai (a former RSS member behind the Vyapam test-rigging expose), for example, is contesting the Assembly elections on a JAYS ticket. ""We want to bridge the rich-poor divide. They talk of smart cities, we talk of smart villages,"" Alawa says. Alawa's perfunctory meeting with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Chouhan in October was a non-starter. Now, he is stitching up an alliance with the Congress. Many small players, including retired IAS officer Hiralal Trivedi's SAPAKS (Samanya Pichda Alpsankhyak Kalyan Samaj Sanstha) and the Gondwana Gantantra Party, are nipping at the BJP and Congress in Madhya Pradesh. Alawa, like these outfits, counts just one broad social group as its base. However, one in every five voters in the state is tribal, which distinguishes JAYS from others. It is now akin to a wild card in the Assembly election — either poised to flop miserably, or dictate terms after the polls are over.",2018-10-31,"Adivasis,Assembly Election 2018,Hiralal Alawa,Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti,JAYS,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh Polls,PoliticsDecoder,Tribal Population,Tribals","Hiralal Alawa's Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti poised to take on BJP, Congress in Madhya Pradesh polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/hiralal-alawas-jai-adivasi-yuva-shakti-poised-to-take-on-bjp-congress-in-madhya-pradesh-polls-5478241.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": A day after the Supreme Court decided against urgent hearings in the Ram Janmahoomi-Babri Masjid case, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said justice delayed can be justice denied. ""The matter pertaining to Shri Ram Janmabhoomi is before the Supreme Court. Justice delivered timely is considered to be the best justice. Delay in justice sometimes amounts to injustice,"" he said on  . At the same time, the tweet appealed to the seers demanding early construction of a temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya to exercise patience. He said they should be partners in all “meaningful efforts” towards evolving a solution to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi issue. This, he tweeted, will establish peace and amity in the country and also strengthen respect towards all constitutional bodies. “For resolving the case promptly, it would have been better if a quick hearing of the matter was held by the court for the sake of peace and brotherhood in the country,"" he said in another remark to the media. ""This possibility, however, does not seem likely as of now,"" he said, replying to a query on the sidelines of an event here. He said the matter is in the apex court but for peace and brotherhood and for honouring the beliefs of a large number of people, all alternatives need to be explored. ""The counsel for the Uttar Pradesh government had also appealed to the Supreme Court for a speedy trial in the matter,"" he said. The apex court on Monday said the course of hearings in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute will be decided in the first week of January by an appropriate bench. This has intensified demands by the RSS and its affiliated organisation that the government should bring a law allowing construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site.

Ajay Singh,"Before he laid the foundation for the world’s tallest statue of India’s first deputy prime minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, on 31 October, 2013, Narendra Modi (then chief minister of Gujarat), used to keep a small-scale prototype of the proposed statue on the desk in his office. When hosting foreign dignitaries in the office, he would spend considerable time explaining the significance of the grand project. He even gifted small replicas to some of them. Iconography is not only an art but also intrinsic to politics. Five years later, now as prime minister, when he dedicated to the nation the 182-metre tall statue, Modi completed the appropriation of an icon who originally belonged to the Congress but has been forgotten by that party. Modi will convince history that Patel belonged more to him and the BJP than to the Congress. He made sure that people of India were with him in this ambitious initiative. He persuaded the people across the country to emotionally invest in the building of the statue. In the first leg of the building the structure, he demanded that agriculture implements and other tools be donated from every village of the country to make provision for the iron in the making of the statue. The drive mobilised BJP workers and other nationalist organisations apparently to correct a “historical wrong” perpetuated by a dynastic Congress that could not look beyond one family. There is no doubt that in terms of the size and scale, Modi today on the occasion of the 143  birth anniversary of the great leader dedicated the Statue of Unity – at Kevadia Colony, the site of the Sardar Sarovar Dam in central Gujarat – that has dwarfed all larger-than-life statues in the world. In popular psyche, it would leave an ineradicable imprint that Sardar Patel was a counter-icon whose contribution to nation-building was disingenuously undermined by his own party, the Congress, monopolised by a bunch of power-seekers. For future historians, a tablet recording the contribution of villages and every individual in the making of the statue is preserved for records’ sake. The fact that Patel has been dusted off from the record book and refurbished and revitalised as an unparalleled icon of India’s freedom struggle goes to the credit of Modi and the BJP. Forget about the history of Patel’s run-in with the Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh (RSS) following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. And certainly, it would be futile at the moment to recall the fact that the RSS was proscribed for the first time during Patel’s tenure as the home minister. In essence, the realisation of Modi’s Sardar project is calculated to effect a paradigm shift in politics. It is a determined attempt to highlight a right-wing, nationalist stream of the Congress represented by Patel and others like Purushottam Das Tandon and KM Munshi. Historically this space was constricted within the party by Jawaharlal Nehru and his left-leaning colleagues within the party. Modi has brought that stream to the foreground. But it would be naïve to believe that Modi is merely aiming at only capturing the right-wing, nationalist political space. In his 50-minute speech today, Modi combined his political objectives quietly deftly by emphasising on the ‘India is eternal’ theme to the appropriation of other national and regional icons of society. For instance, he referred to the creation of a monument for BR Ambedkar and the building of a tall statue of Sir Chhotu Ram in Haryana. In the same breath, he also referred to revolutionaries like Shyamji Krishna Varma, Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. It is nobody’s argument that the co-option of historical icons by Modi and the BJP would translate profitably into votes. But there is little doubt that it enables the party to produce an effective political narrative that may find resonance across the country. At the same time, such moves also enable the party’s cadre to get charged and mobilised beyond the ideological blindfold and approach people beyond the traditional support base. This is the context in which Modi’s innovative politics is significant while Congress seems stuck in the old groove, harping on issues that have lost touch with masses.",2018-11-01,"BJP,Congress,Mahatma Gandhi,Narendra Modi,Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh,RSS,Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,Statue Of Unity","Narendra Modi unveils 'Statue of Unity': In one sweep, PM ejects Congress to make Sardar Patel BJP's 'own'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modi-unveils-statue-of-unity-in-one-sweep-pm-ejects-congress-to-make-sardar-patel-bjps-own-5478911.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday alleged that the ""family"" of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was involved in the Vyapam scam and thus he was ready to face defamation cases for his remarks.

However, reacting to the allegations levelled by the Congress chief, a senior leader of the BJP state unit said he was misleading the people. On the other hand, Congress too owned-up to Rahul's goof-up and said that the mix-up happened as Rahul was extensively travelling for elections to Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and the chief ministers of the three states were facing ""serious corruption charges"".

Press Trust of India,": Condemning the Maoist attack in poll-bound Chhattisgarh in which two police personnel and a Doordarshan News cameraman were killed, the Congress Tuesday expressed its condolences and said people were determined to oust the Raman Singh government from the state. While Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the attack in the state's Dantewada district had saddened him, the party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala paid tributes to the deceased and termed the BJP government in the state ""incompetent and worthless"". Two policemen were also injured in the attack near Nilavaya village, about 450 km from the state capital Raipur. Chief Minister Raman Singh has described the ambush as a cowardly act by Naxals who are against democracy and development and have acted out of desperation. Expressing his sorrow and condolences, the Congress chief said on Twitter, ""I express my sorrow and deep condolences to the families of the two policemen and Doordarshan cameraman killed in the attack."" Surjewala paid tributes to the deceased and said the people of Naxal-hit Chhattisgarh had made up their mind to oust the ""incompetent and worthless government of Chief Minister Raman Singh"". ""A coward and scared Raman Singh has no right to be the chief minister even for a minute now,"" said Surjewala.

Press Trust of India,": Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said women of all age groups should be allowed to enter the Sabarimala temple, a remark that was at variance with the stand taken by his party's Kerala unit and which created ripples in the southern state. Gandhi, however, acknowledged that his opinion is different from that of his party on the ""emotional issue"" after the Supreme Court last month lifted the ban on entry of women of menstrual age to the hilltop shrine of Lord Ayyappa in Kerala. ""It is a very emotional issue and my personal thinking on the matter is different from my party's Kerala unit,"" Gandhi told a select group of journalists in Indore in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh. ""My personal view point on the issue of Sabarimala temple is that men and women are equal. All women should get permission to enter into the temple. However, my party's Kerala unit's view is that it is a very emotional issue for both men and women, he said. ""Therefore, my personal opinion and my party's Kerala unit's thinking is different on the matter. My party represents the feeling of Kerala's natives on the issue,"" he added. The remarks by Gandhi came on a day when hundreds of BJP workers staged a ""hunger strike"" in front of the state police chief's office in Thiruvananthapuram protesting the LDF government's decision to implement the Supreme Court order that allowed entry of girls and women of all age groups to the shrine and also the police crackdown on the protesters. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan welcomed Gandhi's statement and flayed the state unit saying it was 'unfortunate' that the Congress in the state was not in sync with the its national leadership on the Sabarimala issue. ""It is unfortunate that the Congress in Kerala does not have the same opinion as that of the party's national leadership on the subject,"" he said in a facebook post. A section of Congress leaders were adopting a 'conservative' approach on the issue which would only help the BJP, the chief minister said. Chennithala, the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, asserted that the Congress and the party-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in the state were with the believers of Lord Ayyappa who want the ban on entry of girls and women in the menstruating age group to be restored. ""AICC chief has given permission to take that stand,"" he told reporters in Kozhikode, adding Gandhi's views on Sabarimala were his personal opinion.

Press Trust of India,": The Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar on Tuesday accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of ""blackmailing"" the BJP to secure a seat-sharing deal favourable to his Janata Dal (United) while denying ""adequate"" representation to Union minister Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) - an NDA constituent in the state. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary made the statement reacting to a press conference in New Delhi by Kushwaha, wherein the RLSP chief had expressed his readiness to make ""sacrifice"" in the Lok Sabha polls but expressed his displeasure over his party not getting a 'ministerial berth' in the Nitish Kumar goverrnment. ""We fully back Upendra Kushwaha's concern over his party not getting a ministerial berth in Bihar government despite the NDA being in power and his party being its constituent for over four years"", Tiwary told  . ""Kumar fought tooth and nail to secure a respectable share of seats for his JD(U) by blackmailing the BJP with the help of Prashant Kishor, whom he has made his party's national vice-president. Kishor has friends in all parties and had given the BJP the hint that Kumar was ready to switch sides if he did not get his due in the NDA"", Tiwary alleged. ""However, when it comes to giving Kushwaha his due, Kumar has different standards. Does his government not enjoy the support of RLSP MLAs. Just look at the manner in which Shah and Kumar made the announcement about seat-sharing last week. It looked as if Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP and Kushwaha's party did not exist"", the RJD leader - who had been a close aide of the Bihar chief minister till a few years ago - said. ""Both LJP and RLSP have been given a shabby treatment by the BJP which seems to have forgotten that these were the parties that stood by its side when Nitish was busy trying to chart an independent course. At least LJP has Pashupati Kumar Paras as its representative in the state government. What does the RLSP have"", he asked. Tiwary's comments are the latest in a series of sympathetic gestures by the RJD towards Kushwaha, whom it has been expecting to switch sides out of frustration. Kushwaha had quit the JD(U) in 2013, months after being suspended for anti-party activities, and floated his own outfit. Although he described Kumar as his ""elder brother"" in the Delhi press conference, he is known to have viewed the JD(U)'s return to the NDA in 2017 with consternation. Tiwary, along with the state RJD president Ram Chandra Purve, had tried to fish in troubled waters earlier in 2018 when they appeared in a ""human chain"" organized by the RLSP which BJP and JD(U) stayed away from. RJD heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav has been maintaining that there was a ""standing invitation"" to Kushwaha to join the Mahagathbandhan and a meeting between the two leaders last week, shortly after Shah and Nitish spoke to the media, had fuelled speculations about the RLSP chief's future move.",2018-10-31,"BIhar,BJP,Janata Dal United,Lok Sabha 2019,National Democratic Alliance,NewsTracker,Nitish Kumar,Patna,Prashant Kishor,Rashtriya Janata Dal,Rashtriya Lok Samta Party,Shivanand Tiwary,Tejashwi Yadav,Upendra Kushwaha","JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar blackmailed BJP for favourable seat-sharing deal, denied RLSP 'adequate' representation, claims RJD",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jdu-chief-nitish-kumar-blackmailed-bjp-for-favourable-seat-sharing-deal-denied-rlsp-adequate-representation-claims-rjd-5479851.html,firstpost,-1,0

Shahroz Afridi," Survivors of the world’s worst industrial tragedy are still fighting a dual battle — one, internally, struggling with the health-related aftermath of the disaster, and second, on the outside, waiting for adequate compensation. On the intervening night of 2 and 3 December, 1984, a leak from the Union Carbide India Ltd's pesticide plant in Bhopal exposed over five lakh people to methyl isocyanate gas. The highly toxic substance killed over 3,700 people and injured over 5.5 lakh people, which also led to permanent disabilities among scores of those affected. While these are the official numbers, others estimate that at least 8,000 people died within two weeks of the disaster. While the Madhya Pradesh Assembly election was announced on 6 October, groups working for victims of the tragedy decided at a meeting on 18 September that in this poll, they will vote for the party that promises compensation. These groups, which included the Bhopal Group for Information and Action, Bhopal Gas Peedit Nirashrit Pensionbhogi Sangharsh Morcha and Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh, decided that the promise should be notarised, not verbal, so legal action can be initiated if the party did not fulfil the terms and conditions. On 24 October, dozens of hoardings and banners sprung up in colonies where survivors of the Bhopal gas tragedy live in large numbers. A hoarding carried a historical representational photo of the disaster, with the slogan, ""  (whoever provides compensation will get the vote)"". The banner also claimed that it represented a combined voice of all victims and survivors of the incident. ""We have been betrayed by all political parties. For us, the BJP is no different than the Congress, which allowed Warren Anderson (the owner of the Union Carbide factory) to flee. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised Rs 5 lakh as compensation to every survivor of the disaster. More than seven years have passed, and nothing has been done yet,"" said Rachna Dhingra, convener of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action. Explaining the survivors' strategy, Dhingra said there are seven constituencies in Bhopal district, where Narela and Bhopal North host the largest population of victims and survivors of the tragedy. Both constituencies have more than 80 to 90 percent voters with direct or indirect links with the incident. Constituencies such as Bhopal Central and Huzur, too, have a sizeable population of families of victims and survivors, who still suffer from the aftermath of the disaster. There are around 40 percent survivor voters each in these two constituencies, and the numbers are enough to affect results. Berasia could be considered the rural extension of Bhopal district, but Govindpura and Bhopal South-West, too, have a sizeable population of survivors who migrated. ""On the basis of the betrayal the gas tragedy survivors' community has faced, all organisations working for them have decided to ask for a notarised pledge from candidates contesting from these constituencies,"" Dhingra said, adding that they have been asked to ensure at least Rs 5 lakh compensation. Rashida Bi of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh said, ""We are insisting on a notarised pledge so that if   backtrack on their words, we can take legal action against them."" These organisations have started campaigning and have been   from the BJP and Congress to agree to their demands. Vinod Kulhare, Sonu Manjhi, Sauraiya Ansari and Narayan Dubey of the BJP, who work at the   level, strongly agreed to the demands. Similarly, Sajid Ansari, JP Naagar and Sanjiv Kumar, who have been promoting and working for the Congress, said they will try to convince their senior leaders to seriously consider the demands and warn them of consequences. Of the two prominent constituencies with a high population of survivors of the gas tragedy, Bhopal North is represented by Congress MLA Arif Aqueel, while Narela is represented by BJP MLA and state cabinet minister Vishwas Sarang. Both legislators have avoided questions on compensation for the families, but speak about looking after medical and social needs. Aqueel, who has been representing Bhopal North for the past 15 years, said he has been demanding justice for the victims, but the BJP government has not paid any heed to them. ""I have tried to provide them with potable water and basic health facilities from my funds, but the BJP government has done nothing for them. Rather, their representatives have encroached upon playgrounds and community halls,"" he claimed. Sarang claimed: ""I have tried to ensure a regular supply of medicines in hospitals meant for gas tragedy victims, besides good doctors. My government has also tried to provide several measures for employment."" Dhingra, however, brushed his claim aside. She said Sarang, despite being the Minister for Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation in the Madhya Pradesh government, has done little to provide relief. The convener of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan, Abdul Jabbar, said that Union Carbide gave a compensation of $470 million (Rs 715 crore), and the payment was received in March 1989. Meanwhile, the state government initiated work to fill the compensation forms of the survivors. The money began to be distributed in 1990 and has continued for more than a decade. However, most of the compensation was provided between 1990 and 1995. On an average, 94 percent of the victims received Rs 25,000 as compensation in 1985. After a legal battle around 10 years later, they received Rs 25,000 from the interest from the compensation accumulated in banks, which means that the victims effectively received only Rs 25,000 as compensation, Jabbar said. The activist added that even today, about 5,000 to 7,000-odd victims seek outpatient department services in seven specialised gas relief hospitals. Two lakh victims were permanently affected after exposure to the deadly methyl isocyanate gas. ""The most surprising thing is that no medical treatment protocol has been prescribed for gas victims in 34 years,"" he said. Interestingly, the data provided for compensation and loss by the state and Union governments did not match, and they were later revised on court orders.

Press Trust of India," Top Congress leaders held a meeting on Wednesday to select the party's candidates for Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. However, the party did not announce the name of any candidate. The party's central election committee, headed by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, held separate discussions for selecting candidates for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Press Trust of India,"The apex body of Bru refugees in Tripura has appealed to political parties in Mizoram to refrain from visiting the relief camps for poll campaigns, ahead of the 28 November elections to the 40-member Assembly. R Laldawngliana, the vice president of Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum (MBDPF), said the community members were not keen on attending public meetings by parties from Mizoram. ""We do not welcome poll canvassing inside the camps. The members here are not looking forward to attending public meetings by the parties, just before the polls,"" he said. The general secretary of the outfit, Bruno Msha, said unorganised campaigns by political parties could lead to a law-and-order situation. He, however, clarified that political parties have to approach the MBDPF leadership if they wish to carry out campaigns in the region. ""If any political party wishes to hold a public rally, it should get in touch with the MBDPF leadership. We do not wish to create any law-and-order situation in the camps, where one group could be pitted against another,"" Msha said. He also noted that no campaigner from Mizoram has visited the relief camps so far, but flags of different political parties were on display in a number of households. Thousands of Bru community members fled Mizoram and took shelter in Tripura following ethnic clashes in 1997. Violence broke out after a forest official was killed by Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) militants. The Centre, in association with the governments of Mizoram and Tripura, had been trying to repatriate the displaced Brus in phases. Though several Bru families have returned to Mizoram over the years, many refused to leave Tripura citing security reasons and inadequate package. The MBDPF had recently appealed to the Election Commission of India to establish polling stations in the relief camps for the Bru voters.

Press Trust of India," India No 2 Karman Thandi and No  3 Pranjala Yadlapalli made contrasting first round exits from the L&T Mumbai Open being played at the Cricket Club of India on Wednesday. Karman made a tame exit as she lost in straight sets, 2-6, 4-6, to top-seeded Chinese Saisai Zheng in the singles after starting off brilliantly by taking a 2-0 lead, but then slumping badly and dropping the next ten games on the trot to lose in 1 hour and 17 minutes. But the bigger heartbreak was reserved for Pranjala, ranked 288. She won the opening set 6-3 and was on the cusp of eliminating number five seed Luksika Kumkhum of Thailand when she was serving for the match at 5-3 before the latter made a splendid comeback and won 7-5 to level the set scores. A downcast Pranjala, who came into this USD 125,000 WTA event with back to back wins in two 25K ITF events in Lagos, Nigeria, dropper her serve early in the third set and lost the match 3-6 5-7 1-6 in 2 hours, 13 minutes to the 103rd ranked Thai. Pranjala, who is training under Stephen Koon in the Thai capital of Bangkok, had grabbed the opening set with some aggressive play that helped her break Kumkhums serve twice in the third and ninth games. The Thai was put under similar pressure by the Hyderabad-based Pranjala in the second set and was broken in the fourth game at 30 after Kumkhum served two double faults to take a 3-1 lead. But she was broken immediately back by the Thai, before the Indian broke the Thai's serve again to go 4-2 and then 5-3 up. Kumkhum made a great fight-back when faced with elimination as she applied tremendous pressure on Pranjalas serve which was broken finally on the seventh break point after deuce was called 5 times. This was the turning point as the Thai took the set by breaking her rival's serve in the 11th to lead 6-5 and held her serve at love to win it 7-5 and force the decider. The final set was a washout as Kumkhum raced to win it 6-1 to enter the second round. Earlier, Karman let herself down against her Chinese opponent, ranked far above her in the world, by committing far too many errors. The tall Indian girl, back from a runner-up finish last week in China in a 25K ITF event, held her opening service game at love and then broke the top-seeded Zhangs serve at 15 to raise visions of some good contest which was not to be. From 2-0, the 20-year-old Karman lost the next eight games in the opening set which she lost 6-2 without the Chinese woman, who has already earned close to 2.3 million USD in prize money, really being forced to do something extraordinary. Karman, ranked 215, lost the opening set and then was hopelessly down 0-4 after conceding her serve twice when she picked up her game a bit and won her first game. At 1-5, and 15-40 she looked down and out but then saved three match points to hold her serve and keep afloat. Against the run of play the Indian broke Zhangs serve to narrow it to 3-5, held her own to make it 4-5 but then her comeback trail ended as the Chinese woman served out for the match at love. The match showed the huge gap between the two women. Karman had lost to the Chinese woman in straight sets in the round of 16 earlier this year in Nanking. Zhang had words of encouragement for the beaten Indian girl afterwards. ""Karman is strong and has a bright future. She should attack more,"" were the Chinese words about Karman. ""I missed a couple of short balls and finishing balls in the first set. I was getting better in the second set but it was too late. I couldn't find any momentum. I need to work on my fitness,"" said Karman after her first round loss. Last year also she had lost in round one in the WTA event. Fourth seeded Olga Danilovic, a 17-year-old from Serbia, went down in three sets against Montenegros Danka Kovinic in the first round. Second seed and last year's losing finalist, Dalila Jakupovic of Slovenia overpowered Russian opponent Veronika Kudermetova in straight sets to reach the second round. Singles: 1st round: 1-Saisai Zheng (CHN) bt Karman Thandi (IND) 6-2 6-4; Danka Kovinic (MNE) bt 4-Olga Danilovic (SRB) 4-6 7-5 6-0; 6-Margarita Gasparyan (RUS) bt Tereza Mrdeza (CRO) 6-3 6-2; 5-Luksika Kumkhum (THA) bt Pranjala Yadlapalli (IND) 3-6 7-5 6-1.

Senjo M R,"Amid the festering family feud, Samajwadi Party (SP) founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday visited offices of both his party, now headed by his son Akhilesh Yadav and the newly-floated rebel outfit of his brother Shivpal Yadav, leaving his party workers wondering where his sympathies lie. Coming barely a month after his second son Prateek Yadav's wife Aparna Yadav openly expressed her support to uncle Shivpal Yadav, the SP patriarch's visit to both the outfits during the day compounded the confusion of party workers in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. ""We have been left wondering with whom Netaji's (Mulayam) sympathies lie and which party to work for,"" said a veteran party worker, requesting anonymity. Mulayam Singh first reached the office of his brother's fledgling party, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSPL) at 6, Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, where he exchanged pleasantries with him and where he was even requested to don the mantle of the new outfit's president. And then he drove down to the nearby headquarter of his party, headed by his son and briefly addressed the party workers, giving them his 'mantra' on how to win the next Lok Sabha elections. ""I have offered the party president's post to 'Netaji' (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and a ticket to contest the LS election from the Mainpuri seat. Our party will carry forward the Lohia ideologies,"" said Shivpal Yadav. ""We have formed the party with the blessings of 'Netaji',"" he said as enthusiastic party workers garlanded Mulayam Singh Yadav, who, however, remained non-committal to Shivpal's public offer of the new party's presidentship. At the PSPL office, Mulayam was also offered the new party's flag by Shivpal Yadav and both of them posed before shutterbugs. Shivpal Yadav was recently allotted by the Yogi Adityanath government the sprawling bungalow at Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, vacated by BSP supremo Mayawati on Supreme Court orders. The SP workers' confusion began last month when Prateek Yadav's wife participated in a function organised by Shivpal Yadav and expressed her support for him. She was reported as promising to work towards strengthening the PSPL. Aparna Yadav, who shared the stage with Shivpal Yadav, had said, ""I have always respected chachaji and Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and we will work towards making the Secular Morcha (of Shivpal Yadav) stronger."" Aparna Yadav had also said Shivpal Yadav would decide a suitable time for her to join and contest from the Secular Morcha. Previously too, Mulayam Singh Yadav had made an appearance at a function along side his brother Shivpal Yadav after he launched his new outfit. The event was organised to mark the death anniversary of the party ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia. Though on that occasion Mulayam Singh Yadav had refrained from taking questions from the media, Shivpal Yadav had expressed happiness over the presence of his elder brother. ""On Tuesday, Netaji has graced the occasion with his presence and has given us his blessings. I am sure he will continue to give us his blessings in the future also,"" he had said. In August, Shivpal Yadav had launched 'Samajwadi Secular Morcha' after expressing his disappointment with the Samajwadi Party leadership.",2018-10-30,"Akhilesh Yadav,Aparna Yadav,BSP,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Mayawati,Mulayam Singh Yadav,Netaji,PSPL,Samajwadi Party,Shivpal Yadav,UP,Yogi Adityanath Government","Lok Sabha Election 2019: Amid family feud, Mulayam Singh Yadav meets brother Shivpal; SP workers in quandary",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/lok-sabha-election-2019-amid-family-feud-mulayam-singh-yadav-meets-brother-shivpal-sp-workers-in-quandary-5473741.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service,"Intensifying his efforts to build an Opposition alliance to take on the BJP, Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu will meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday. In his second visit to New Delhi in less than a week, Naidu will call on Rahul as part of his efforts to bring all Opposition parties on a common platform. Addressing a party programme in Amaravati on Wednesday night, Naidu said he will meet Rahul in the national capital on Thursday.

Naidu, who had pulled out of the BJP-led NDA in March, said the policies pursued by the BJP posed a threat to democracy in the country.

He claimed that he was offered the post of prime minister twice, but he refused. He said the time had come again for the TDP to play a key role in national politics.

""The chief minister claimed that in last four years he has brought Maharashtra on the top spot. In what segments did he achieve the first spot?

The Shiv Sena also debunked the speculations of a possible alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the upcoming elections and said, ""In his fourth year, the chief minister has started talking about friendship and merger. He claims that come whatever there will be a coalition. He has said that to stop the fragmentation of Hindu votes, the merger is important.

Press Trust of India,": The ruling Congress in Mizoram on Wednesday urged people of the Christian-dominated state to support the party in the assembly election next month, alleging that the entry of BJP might hurt their religious freedom. Countering the charge, the BJP said it was a propaganda of the Congress to tarnish the image of the party. ""The Congress should win with a comfortable margin as a fractured mandate would pave way for the BJP to go for a post-poll alliance with the Mizo National Front (MNF),"" state Congress spokesperson Lallianchhunga said. ""The BJP can cause damage to the soul, spirit and body of the Christians in Mizoram,"" Lallianchhunga, also the party's media cell chairperson, said in a statement. People should support the Congress, church leaders and civil societies in protecting the state from such dangers and for protecting religious freedom, he said. Mizoram is the only state in the northeastern region under the Congress which is in power since 2008. The election to the 40-member state assembly will be held on November 28. Rev LR Colney, one of the two Christian priests to contest the polls on a BJP ticket, said the party was not a religious group but a political party. Branding the BJP as ""anti-Christian"" and ""pro-Hindu"" was baseless as it has never been proved, he said, adding that it is a propaganda of the Congress to tarnish its image. Persecution of Christians has occurred in many places during the regimes of the Congress, Janata Dal and the BJP, Colney said. In a recent news report, Tripura BJP general secretary Pratima Bhowmik had indicated that in a fractured post-poll scenario, the opposition MNF might form a coalition with the BJP to form government in Mizoram. The MNF, however, has maintained that it would not form an alliance with the BJP or any other party in the upcoming election. ""The MNF leadership cannot afford to be seen as being close to the saffron party as the BJP has been a political pariah in the state,"" Lallianchhunga said. But the post-poll scenario could be different as the MNF would not hesitate to overrule public opinion after the poll process, he claimed. MNF vice president R Lalthangliana said, ""We will contest the elections alone and do not need the help of other parties. We will win"". State BJP president Prof John V Hluna told PTI that the party would go it alone in the election.

Press Trust of India,": Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday began his two-day tour of politically significant Malwa-Nimar region in the poll-bound Madhya Pradesh by offering prayers at the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple, devoted to Lord Shiva, in Ujjain. Clad in a 'dhoti', he performed 'puja' at the ancient temple, which is one of the 12 'Jyotirlingas' (special shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva) in the country. It was Gandhi's second visit to the shrine. He had last visited the temple in 2010, a party leader said. Wearing cream-coloured 'shola' (dhoti called in temple dialect), the Congress chief entered the sanctum sanctorum along with state party unit president Kamal Nath and campaign committee chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia. The 48-year-old Amethi MP performed the puja amid chanting of 'mantras' (hymns) by temple priests. Gandhi's grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi, his father Rajiv Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi too had visited the temple in 1979, 1987 and 2008, respectively to pay their obeisance to Lord Shiva, state Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi told PTI. The Gandhi scion performed the puja of Lord Mahakal (Shiva) for around half an hour, he said. The Congress, had last year, said Gandhi was an ardent ""Shiv bhakt"". In August this year, he had undertaken Kailash Mansarovar Yatra to seek blessings of Lord Shiva. BJP president Amit Shah had visited the temple on 14 July. He had then flagged off the 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra' of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress is in opposition since 2003, will go to polls on 28 November. During his two-day tour, the Congress chief will visit Malwa-Nimar, a politically crucial region which accounts for 66 of the 230 assembly seats in the state. In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP had won 56 seats in the region. The Congress had managed to bag just nine seats, while one went to an Independent.

Press Trust of India,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah, who has pledged his party's support to devotees protesting the entry of women of all ages into Ayyappa temple, has expressed wish to offer prayers at the hill shrine in Sabarimala during the annual pilgrim season starting on November 17, a party leader said Monday. ""The BJP president has expressed desire to visit the Sabarimala temple. But no decision has been taken so far,"" a senior Kerala unit BJP leader told PTI in Thiruvananthapuram. Shah's wish to trek the hills comes days after he declared BJP's full support to the agitation by the devotees against CPM-led Left Democratic Front government's decision to implement the Supreme Court order lifting the ban on entry of women in 10-50 age group from offering prayers at the shrine. In a scathing criticism of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for taking action against Sabarimala protesters, Shah last week claimed an ""Emergency-like"" situation was prevailing in the state and accused the government of ""playing with fire"". If the state government did not stop hurting the devotees, BJP workers would be forced to bring it down, Shah said, drawing a strong reaction from Vijayan, who termed the BJP president's warning an ""attack"" on the Supreme Court, Constitution and the country's judicial system. Police have arrested over 3,500 people till Sunday in connection with the protests that rocked the state earlier this month. A large number of frenzied devotees staying put at the temple complex and base camps had prevented at least a dozen females between the age group of 10 and 50 from entering the temple when it opened for monthly pujas from October 17 to 22. Protests were also held in several other parts of Kerala by the devotees, who included a large number of women, seeking to protect the tradition of the shrine whose deity, Lord Ayyappa, is celibate. Intensifying the agitation, the BJP-led NDA Sunday announced a six-day 'Rath Yatra' from Kasaragod to Sabarimala from November 8 to save the customs and traditions of the famous temple. Various other agitation programmes, including a fast in front of the state DGP's office Thiruvananthapuram, had also been planned. The BJP is apparently seeing the Sabarimala issue as an opportunity to widen its support base in the southern state. The party has so far failed to make a strong presence in the bi-polar polity in the state, dominated by the LDF and the opposition Congress-headed United Democratic Front (UDF). In 2016 assembly polls, the BJP had scripted history by winning the Nemom seat, and garnered 14.65 per cent votes.

Press Trust of India,"The ruling AIADMK Monday asked the 18 disqualified party MLAs siding with rival leader T T V Dhinakaran to ""kneel"" and ""apologise"" at the memorial of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa and return to the party fold.

A write-up in the vernacular daily came days after the AIADMK leadership extended an olive branch to the 18 disqualified legislators, asking them to jump on to the ruling party bandwagon, as the ruling party leaders  O Panneerselvam and K Palaniswami alleged Dhinakaran of ""misleading"" them.

Press Trust of India,": Women who wanted to enter the Sabarimala temple did so with the intention of disturbing law and order, Union minister KJ Alphons said Monday. Talking to the media in Delhi, Alphons questioned the intentions of a 'Muslim' and a 'Christian' woman attempting to go to Sabarimala and alleged they were not there because of their love for Lord Ayappa but to create a law and order situation. ""Who is trying to disrupt Sabarimala Temple? A Muslim lady who doesn't even go to mosque. She tries to go to Sabarimala to prove a point. There was a Christian girl who doesn't even go to church, she was going to Sabarimala just to be there before cameras,"" he alleged. ""I think this is not acceptable.

When somebody does this, then what happens? I think this is completely unfair,"" he said. After the Supreme Court on September permitted the entry of women belonging to all age groups in the hilltop shrine, the temple opened its doors on 17 October, but closed on Monday following huge protests as devotees sought to protect the tradition of the shrine. The protesters did not allow any women in the ""prohibited"" age group to enter the temple premises.

Press Trust of India,": The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Monday said Congress president Rahul Gandhi is exhibiting ""fancy dress Hinduism"" to fool people and demanded action against his party colleague Shashi Tharoor for his ""scorpion"" remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The saffron party's attack on Gandhi came in the backdrop of his frequent visits to temples - the latest being a trip to Ujjain's Mahakaleshwar temple on Monday, ahead of his tour of the politically significant Malwa-Nimar region in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh. The ruling party asked Gandhi to expel Tharoor from the Congress for his controversial remarks against Modi. The Congress MP from Kerala stoked a fresh controversy on Sunday, claiming that an unnamed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader had compared the prime minister to ""a scorpion sitting on a Shivling"" and termed it as an extraordinarily striking metaphor. ""The objectionable statement of Tharoor, who is very close to Rahul Gandhi, has disrespected not only the holy deity of Lord Mahadev, worshipped by crores of Hindus, but also the prime minister. In such a situation, how will he (Gandhi) offer prayers at the Mahakal temple,"" BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters in Indore. Alleging that Congress leaders were continuously disrespecting the Hindus by making objectionable statements, Patra demanded that Gandhi apologise for Tharoor's remarks and expel the 62-year-old UN diplomat-turned-politician from the party. He claimed that after the humiliating defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, a committee headed by former Union minister AK Antony had said the Congress should take care of the Hindus for its political revival as it was losing ground because of its projected image of a ""party of Muslims"". ""After the Antony committee's report, Rahul Gandhi is exhibiting fancy dress Hinduism continuously. To mislead the Hindus, he is sporting a   (scared thread) over the shirt. We demand that   Rahul Gandhi clarify to which   (clan) does he belong to,"" Patra said. He also said since Gandhi had not given any answer to this question, people were calling him a  .

Debobrat Ghose,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi began a round of his poll campaign in Madhya Pradesh's Malwa region with a visit to the Mahakaleshwar temple, a jyotirlinga shrine at Ujjain on Monday. This came as no surprise. Temple trips have become an inevitable part of the Congress president's itinerary these days. His mega roadshow in Bhopal one-and-a-half month ago was peppered with posters of him pouring water on the shivling at Manosarovar. Hindu priests chanting mantras have become a routine visual during his rally launches. So what is the game plan behind the head of an avowedly secular party desperately trying to look religious? The BJP may mock him, saying he is making a futile effort to wean Hindus away from the party, but it should be careful. Hindus are not a monolithic vote bank as it would like to believe. If Rahul gets his messaging right, he might be successful in impressing a big audience in the community, particularly in the rural areas. Also, the saffron party is underestimating the capability of the Congress to be flexible on principles while responding to emerging situations. Gauging from people's response to Rahul in Madhya Pradesh, where a high-decibel campaign for the Assembly polls is underway, the party appears to have blunted to some extent the charge that it is anti-Hindu. The Congress president tweeted in Hindi on Monday morning about his two-day Madhya Pradesh Sankalp Yatra and about his offering prayers to Lord Shiva by visiting the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain. Here’s a look at how Rahul is mixing religion and electioneering in Madhya Pradesh. The state has provided Rahul with a unique platform to experiment and launch himself in several avatars. First, he kicked off his poll campaign in August by visiting the Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga shrine in Khandwa district and paying obeisance to Lord Shiva. Later, after his return from Kailash Mansarovar, he was hailed as a  , with hoardings put up across Bhopal. Further, at Chitrakoot in Satna, he has been projected as ""Ram-Bhakt Pandit Rahul Gandhi."" Earlier, the Congress had proclaimed Rahul as a ‘Shiv-bhakt’ (a devotee of Lord Shiva) for the first time ahead of the Assembly elections held in Gujarat last year. He had visited the Somnath Temple in Gujarat and offered prayers in December 2017, which made headlines. Even during the Karnataka election, the Congress president began his campaign after visiting the famous Goddess Huligamma temple in Koppal district. Historically, one of the biggest contributing factors for the rise of the Muslim League in pre-independence India had been the perception among Muslims that the Indian National Congress was a party of rich businessmen and Hindus. Post-independence, the Congress gradually wooed the Muslims in a big way for electoral gains. Now, the wheels seem to have turned again. The Congress president has now begun to visit famous Hindu temples before elections – whether in Gujarat, Karnataka or Madhya Pradesh. The BJP, which has been claiming to be the sole representative of the Hindus, needs rethinking. The Congress party is gradually appropriating the Hindu plank – slowly albeit steadily. It’s a well-planned strategy of the Congress to capture the BJP’s core vote bank. Rahul is simultaneously reaching out to the rural electorate by communicating his ""soft Hindu"" plank. The message he wants to deliver is that despite being a ""secular, non-communal"" party, the Congress is not averse to Hindu ethos. Rather, it respects the inherent idea of Hinduism. This approach reminds one of the way the Congress appropriated the Left’s ideas over the years – starting from the days of Indira Gandhi. The party appropriated the key elements of the Left’s economic agenda and presented the same as its own. Eventually, it proved to be a death knell for the Left. Whether it is the BJP, Congress or any political party – no one can undermine the importance of the Mahakaleshwar temple – one of the 12 Jyotirlinga shrines in India dedicated to Lord Shiva. 
It is also one of the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas, an important seat of worship of the Shakti or the goddess in Hindu tradition. The temple finds a mention in the work Meghdutam by the great Sanskrit poet of the 4th-5th century, Kalidasa. It also finds mention in the 7th century Tamil ‘Tevaram’ hymns. The temple complex was said to have been destroyed by the Delhi Sultan Shams-uddin Iltutmish during his raid of Ujjain in 1234-35. The present structure was built by the Maratha general Ranoji Scindia in 1734. In subsequent decades, other members of the Gwalior royalty — the Scindias — made significant additions to the temple structure. One of the most sacred places for Hindus, the   has drawn the rich, the powerful and the ordinary in equal numbers. Prior to Rahul's visit, BJP president Amit Shah had visited the shrine and offered prayers on 14 July and thereafter flagged off the ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even from within the Nehru-Gandhi family, Rahul is not the first to have visited this revered abode of Lord Shiva. Indira Gandhi had visited the Mahakaleshwar temple in 1979, before returning to power with a huge mandate. Nearly three decades later, the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi also visited this Jyotirlinga in 2008. Be it the Congress or the BJP, both need the blessings of Lord Shiva, as there are 50 Assembly seats across the ten districts of the Malwa region. Out of these, the Congress and BJP hold 4 and 45 seats respectively, while one seat is represented by an independent candidate. This region can prove to be the make-or-break factor for any party to win the Assembly election. In his  , two-term former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh said that as he had been assigned an important work by the Congress president, he would not be present in the Congress’ programmes in Ujjain and Indore. However, according to party sources, Digvijay has deliberately been kept aside from Rahul’s rally as he has been considered ‘anti-Hindu’ due to his caustic remarks aimed at the BJP and the RSS. The former chief minister exercises a considerable influence in Bhopal and Indore. In the past, besides lashing out at the BJP-RSS combine, Singh on various occasions had made remarks, which were apparently aimed at minority appeasement. Recently, he also said, “The Congress gets less votes if I campaign, give speeches.” Temple visits and tweets notwithstanding, it is just a matter of time before the world knows who succeeded in appeasing Lord Shiva, and the electorate.",2018-10-29,"Amit Shah,BJP,Congress,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Mahakaleshwar Temple,Malwa,PoliticalPlay,Rahul Gandhi,Ujjain",Rahul Gandhi’s temple run in Madhya Pradesh: Why the BJP should not be smug about Hindu votes,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhis-temple-run-in-madhya-pradesh-why-the-bjp-should-not-be-smug-about-hindu-votes-5465901.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," In poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi began his day Monday by offering prayers at Ujjain's Mahakaleshwar temple, addressed two election rallies and signed it off with a road-show in Indore amid chants of ""Har Har Mahadev"". While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retorted, saying Gandhi was trying to build his image as that of a ""Shiv  "" with his temple visits, the Congress chief hit out at the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan regime in Madhya Pradesh, alleging failures on several fronts, including jobs and corruption. Earlier in the day, Gandhi addressed public meetings at Ujjain and Jhabua. The Congress had in 2017 said that Gandhi was an ardent ""Shiv  "". In August, he had undertaken the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. Clad in white kurta-pyjama, Gandhi waved at the people from an open-top vehicle and shook hands with some of them during the three-kilometre journey from the Bada Ganpati intersection in the state's commercial capital to the historic Rajwada. His vehicle passed through dense commercial areas like the Tory Corner, Lohar Patti and Jawahar Marg, before reaching its destination. He was greeted with the chants of "" "" (hail Lord Shiva) by the party workers at many places. Addressing a corner meeting from his vehicle at Rajwada, Gandhi attacked the BJP-led central government over the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which he often dubs as the ""Gabbar Singh Tax"". ""Did the shopkeepers of Indore benefit from the Gabbar Singh Tax? This tax regime has added to the difficulties of small traders,"" the Congress chief said. The GST would be implemented in a ""correct manner"" if the Congress was elected to power after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he said, adding that his party would bring in ""a corruption-free system of one-tax, lower-tax"". Gandhi accused the Chouhan government of ""failing"" to provide employment to the youth in the state and ""ruining"" the traditional textile industry of Indore. He alleged that the Centre waived the debts of crores of rupees of 15 rich people in the country, ""but it does not want to waive the debts of farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers"". The Congress chief was accompanied by the party's state unit chief, Kamal Nath, and Jyotiraditya Scindia, who heads its state campaign committee. Indore is considered a bastion of the ruling BJP. In the 2013 state Assembly polls, the saffron party had won all the five seats here. Earlier in the day, Gandhi performed "" "" at the ancient Mahakaleshwar temple of Lord Shiva in Ujjain, located 62 kilometres from here. Mahakaleshwar is one of the 12 "" "" (special shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva) in the country. Wearing a cream-coloured "" "" (dhoti), the Congress chief entered the sanctum sanctorum, along with Nath and Scindia. It was Gandhi's second visit to the shrine. His first visit was in 2010. 
BJP president Amit Shah had visited the temple on July 14. He had then flagged off Chouhan's ""Jan Ashirwad Yatra"". Meanwhile, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at Raipur in Chhattisgarh that Gandhi was trying to build his image as a ""Shiv  "" with his temple visits Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress is in the opposition since 2003, will go to the polls on 28 November and the results will be announced on 11 December. During his two-day tour that began Monday, Gandhi will visit the politically crucial Malwa-Nimar region, which accounts for 66 of the 230 Assembly seats in the state. In the 2013 polls, the BJP had won 56 seats in the region and the Congress had managed to bag just nine, while one seat had gone to an Independent candidate. During his tour, Gandhi is scheduled to address rallies in Jhabua, Indore, Dhar, Khargone and Mhow.",2018-10-30,"BJP,Congress,GST,Madhya Pradesh,Mahakaleshwar Temple,MP Elections,NewsTracker,Rahul Gandhi,Ujjain","Madhya Pradesh polls: Rahul Gandhi kicstarts campaign with road-show in Indore, prays at Ujjain's Mahakaleshwar temple",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/madhya-pradesh-polls-rahul-gandhi-kicstarts-campaign-with-road-show-in-indore-prays-at-ujjains-mahakaleshwar-temple-5469211.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sandipan Sharma,"The rise of a third front in Rajasthan led by Jat leader Hanuman Beniwal is the best piece of news the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may have heard in recent months. The new outfit will not only help the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections but also in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The new front led by Beniwal’s fledgling Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) is primarily a congregation of former BJP leaders who don’t see a future for themselves in the saffron party under Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. Their common goal is to get into a position from where they can harm not just the Congress but Raje, as well. The end game of their politics is to demolish Raje and return to the BJP as new power centres of politics in Rajasthan. In the Rajasthan Assembly elections scheduled for 7 December, the RLP is hoping to divide anti-BJP votes and thus harm the Congress. Beniwal and his supporters believe they will win a significant number of seats in a hung Assembly and emerge kingmakers — like HD Kumaraswamy in Karnataka. If that happens, their first choice would be the BJP, minus Raje. The only leader of significance in the third front is Beniwal himself, by virtue of being a leader of the Jats, who are believed to vote en masse for one party in accordance with an old saying in Rajasthan —  . At the moment, Jats do not have a leader with a pan-Rajasthan following. Beniwal’s aim is to fill up this vacuum and become the undisputed leader of the community in the state — considered 12 to 14 percent of the electorate — and unify them. In an election being defined by an undercurrent of anti-incumbency against Raje, the Congress would have been a natural choice for the Jats. Beniwal’s presence will give the community another option, therefore hurting the Congress' prospects. However, the challenge for Beniwal is to lead the community away from the Congress. He is trying to do this by attacking former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who is disliked by Jats for eclipsing leaders from the community in the party. But this strategy may be thwarted by the rise of Sachin Pilot, who is starting with a clean slate with the Jats. The Congress is sending out signals that Pilot is its chief ministerial pick for Rajasthan, thus taking the Jat anger against Gehlot out of the equation. The other problem for the third front is the absence of a broader social coalition. Unlike Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar, or Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, who have the support of Muslims and a few other communities, the Jats stand alone with Beniwal. So their 12 to 14 percent votes can help them defeat a candidate but not win an election. Also, whenever a powerful community starts asserting itself in Rajasthan, it leads to counter-polarisation. This problem could have been addressed if the other leaders in the new front had a large base. But Beniwal’s partners. such as Ghanshyam Tiwari, lack the ability to win from even their own constituencies. So the third front may not find the going easy, with just one leader of significance on the forefront. In the long run though, Beniwal’s rise will help the BJP. It is widely believed that whatever the outcome of the Assembly polls, the BJP will fight elections to Parliament under a new leader who will replace Raje. In all likelihood, the BJP will either anoint a Rajput or a Brahmin as its new face. If Beniwal joins the party under the new leadership, the BJP will be able to forge a larger social coalition, giving it access to a wider vote base than in the Assembly polls.",2018-10-30,"Assembly Election 2018,Assembly Polls,BJP,Congress,Hanuman Beniwal,Jat Leader,Jats In Rajasthan,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Rajasthan Polls,Rashtriya Loktantrik Party,Sachin Pilot","Ahead of Rajasthan polls, Jat leader Hanuman Beniwal's third front comes as best news for BJP, but not without challenges",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ahead-of-rajasthan-polls-jat-leader-hanuman-beniwals-third-front-comes-as-best-news-for-bjp-but-not-without-challenges-5472421.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sriram Karri,"The Andhra Pradesh Police on Sunday   to the VII Additional Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Visakhapatnam, formally conceding that cafeteria waiter Janipalli Srinivasa Rao had attacked YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on 25 October with the intention to kill. This report, thus, dismisses the political narrative of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government that it was a ""staged attack"" aimed at increasing Jagan's popularity by garnering sympathy, ahead of the elections next year. . Bizarrely, the accused purportedly requested Reddy for a selfie and even took it before stabbing him in the arm with a sharp object. Reddy escaped narrowly and providentially. The YSRCP called the attack a ""  and N Chandrababu Naidu"" aimed at eliminating the Opposition leader, whose continuing   (march) of over 3,000 kilometres has augmented palpable anti-incumbency. The YSRCP is sensing a victory in the polls next year and is gearing up to dethrone Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. However, the TDP countered the allegation, calling it a ""staged drama"" that was part of a conspiracy by the YRSCP in cahoots with the BJP to garner sympathy for Jagan. With the state police acknowledging in court that the attack was a serious one, even saying that had the attack been executed as planned, it could have been fatal, it has triggered a wave of panic across Andhra Pradesh and its politics because after a hiatus of nearly 14 years, murder politics might have staged a comeback. The story of Telugu politics is rife with both fake attacks staged by party sympathisers, as well as a long trail of actual murders in both the Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema regions of the state. Murder politics, of which both the Congress and TDP are guilty, has kept politicians and their followers at risk and the state at an emotive and hysterical edge in phases. On 9 January, 1984, during the first anniversary celebrations of the formation of the TDP, its founder and cine idol NT Rama Rao was attacked by a 22-year-old assailant, Mallela Babji, with a pen-knife. NTR had escaped with a minor thumb injury, but the attack, in glaring public view at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in Hyderabad, set the precedent. It was subsequently proven conclusively that it was a staged attack aimed at creating a wave of public sympathy for NTR. The Justice C Sriramulu Commission report stated that the attacker was an NTR fan, and worse, his subsequent death by hanging from a ceiling fan was not a suicide but a murder aimed at suppressing the embarrassing truth. The report held the then TDP government responsible for ""suppressing the homicide"". The report also concluded that the now-deceased sub-inspector investigating the case, J Sambasiva Rao, had misled the inquiry to shield the names of NTR and his son-in-law N Chandrababu Naidu, who were both named in a letter by Babji. In this letter, the supposed assailant had called NTR's injury ""self-inflicted"", adding that he was offered Rs 3 lakh for the attack but only paid Rs 30,000. Ironically, it is the public memory of this staged attack that has given credence to the fusillade of statements bolstering the TDP theory that Jagan, too, had staged an attack on himself using a ""fan"" — as mentioned in the police report — to carry it out, using a ""harmless"" instrument and causing a minor injury. Political attacks and murders are not new to the politics of Andhra Pradesh. In the mid to late 1980s, Vijayawada was in the grip of rowdies who ran organised crime with political patronage. In some cases, these gangsters joined and rose in political ranks, having penetrated both parties, transforming gang wars into political murders. In the most dramatic case, Vangaveti Ranga Rao, a Congress MLA and gangster with a huge caste following in the Kapu community, was murdered by a rival gang led by TDP leader Devineni Rajasekhar ""Nehru"" when he was fasting unto death. Earlier, the same rival gang had also killed his brother Vangaveti Radhakrishna. Devineni Rajasekhar ""Nehru"" had entered politics after the TDP was formed, and his elder brother, Devineni ""Gandhi"" was killed. Subsequently, his younger brother Murali was also killed as a revenge for the murder of Ranga Rao. The death of Ranga Rao had led to large-scale violence against businesses owned by TDP leaders, particularly those held by leaders from the dominant Kamma caste, including the   media house. A statewide curfew was imposed for weeks, and buses stopped plying between cities after sunset. Perhaps it was the deep scars in the collective memory of the event that led to controversy over the release of  , written and directed by Ram Gopal Varma. The families of both rival gangs had objected to many a scene and dialogue in the movie. In the neighbouring hot-headed province of Rayalaseema, with its own long history of faction violence and family feuds spanning generations, TDP legislator P Siva Reddy was killed in a bomb attack on 7 August, 1993. A day before his death, he had asked for additional security from the then Congress government in the Assembly. Making political currency out of the bomb attack, NTR had rushed to the crime scene, prevented the police from moving Siva Reddy's body, and instead, led a procession to Raj Bhavan, seeking dismissal of the Congress government. Taking an ""oath"" to never enter the Assembly until he was elected chief minister, NTR had used the bombing to make a successful comeback the next year. Between the late 1980s and mid-1990s, Andhra Pradesh was caught in a web of political murders and subsequent retaliations and revenge killings. These murders were not restricted to just political leaders; several followers were also killed. A particularly gruesome killing was of former MP Madduru Subba Reddy, who had also served as a minister in PV Narasimha Rao's cabinet in the state in 1973. Killed on 20 June, 1996, at the age of 83 — having undergone a bypass surgery a few weeks earlier — the bus in which he was travelling to Kurnool was attacked with bombs. He was beheaded and only his torso was left behind at the bus station. The killers had taken his severed head as a trophy. This had led the Congress, which reportedly had lost over 50 leaders that year, to accuse the Chandrababu Naidu government of having given his party cadre the green signal to eliminate political rivals, a charge he refuted. The most infamous, bloodiest and fiercest of rivalries featured TDP minister Paritala Ravindra, a former Naxalite, and a failed attempt to kill him with a car bomb in 1997 at a film studio in Hyderabad. This had led to the death of over 40 people, including six TV journalists covering the event Ravindra was attending. He was at the studio to launch a movie on his father, Sri Ramulayya. Ravindra was pushed to a career in insurgency and murder after his father and brother were killed in separate incidents. Former TDP MP and actor Mohan Babu had escaped unhurt in the attack. A year later, miner and factionist YS Raja Reddy, father of former chief minister YS Rajasekhara (YSR) Reddy and Jagan's grandfather, was murdered on 23 May, 1998, by bombs and knives as part of a long factionist feud. On 24 January, 2005, months after the TDP was defeated and the Congress came back to power in Andhra Pradesh after nearly a decade, TDP leader Paritala Ravindra was shot dead at point-blank range at the party office. Jagan was accused of having supported the conspiracy, or perhaps even having masterminded the plan to kill Paritala, forcing his father, the then chief minister YSR, to order an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation, which had acquitted Jagan of all charges. The horror of the rivalry had prompted Ram Gopal Varma to direct a multi-lingual movie in two parts —  , in which Vivek Oberoi had played the role of Paritala on screen. Subsequently, all major political killings stopped, despite the odd sporadic gang war or faction killing. With the attack on Jagan, the politics of Andhra Pradesh has been jolted out of complacency. The fear that murder politics are back after a long gap of nearly 14 years is real. While it is unlikely there will be any objective conclusions to whether Jagan pulled an NTR and staged the attack on himself, or whether the TDP sent an assailant to get rid of the Leader of Opposition before the elections, fear is truly back in the politics of Andhra Pradesh. And Ram Gopal Varma must have started work on his next movie script.",2018-10-30,"Andhra Pradesh,Chandrababu Naidu,Jagan Mohan Reddy,Jagan Mohan Reddy Attack,NTR,Political Murders,Political Violence,PoliticsDecoder,TDP,Telugu Desam Party,YSRCP",Attempted murder attack on Jagan Mohan Reddy triggers fear of revival of political violence in Andhra Pradesh,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/attempted-murder-attack-on-jagan-mohan-reddy-triggers-fear-of-revival-of-political-violence-in-andhra-pradesh-5469711.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": As the ruling BJP is eyeing to field former Congress MLA Dayanand Sopte for the upcoming Mandrem Assembly bypoll in Goa, former state Chief Minister and BJP leader Laxmikant Parsekar on Tuesday indicated that he might rebel against his party. Sopte and another Congress MLA recently resigned as members of the Goa Legislative Assembly and joined the BJP, dealing a blow to the opposition party in the state. Now, as the Congress started consolidating anti-BJP forces ahead of the upcoming bypoll in Mandrem Assembly, Parsekar said the BJP should stop taking him for granted. His statement comes two days after Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) chief Girish Chodankar met him at Mandrem, which the former had represented in the state assembly till 2017. Parsekar had lost to Sopte from Mandrem constituency in north Goa in the February 2017 Assembly polls. Earlier, Parsekar had criticised BJP's Goa unit chief Vinay Tendulkar for not taking him into confidence while inducting Sopte. ""I will not reveal all my cards now. There is a feeling in BJP that I will never rebel against the party or I will never leave it (party). Sometimes, your virtues act as negatives and that has happened in my case. But this time, the party should not take me for granted,"" Parsekar said. Although he confirmed that Chodankar had met him, Parsekar refused to elaborate about the meeting. ""These days there are many people who come and meet me. Chodankar had also come. There were some discussions,"" he 
said. Parsekar said the Mandrem block of the BJP still considers him (Parsekar) as the candidate from the constituency. ""Let the elections be announced. Let the candidates be announced...then I will reveal my stand,"" he said. When contacted, Chodankar said the Congress has been meeting all the ""anti-BJP forces"". ""We are rallying against Sopte, who is the probable BJP candidate in the constituency. We will defeat him in the constituency and our exercise in that direction has begun,"" he said. Chodankar also refused to divulge the details of the meeting with Parsekar, but said ""everyone will come together to defeat the BJP candidate"". Parsekar, who was the chief minister of Goa between 2014 and 2017, is one of the oldest members of the BJP.

Press Trust of India,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in West Bengal is contemplating to field ""considerable"" number of Muslim candidates in the Lok Sabha elections next year with an intent to make inroads into Chief Minster Mamata Banerjee's solid support base among minorities, and corner a sizeable share of this numerically crucial vote bank. The saffron party's aim to make a shift in its political strategy in West Bengal appears to be a result of their harvesting a good number of seats in the local body election early this year by fielding Muslim candidates. 
The BJP had fielded more than 850 candidates from the minority community in the poll to the three-tier panchayats, with nearly half of them winning the elections. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had fielded only two minority candidates in the state, which has a total of 42 seats. However, since the last Lok Sabha polls in the state, Bengal politics has witnessed a paradigm shift with the BJP emerging as the main challenge to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) by outsmarting the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) and the Congress. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh told PTI, the party will aim to field ""considerable"" number of Muslim candidates, given the fact that the state has nearly 30 percent Muslim population. ""Although in our party, tickets are not distributed on the basis of religion, but we are receiving several applications from people of the minority community, expressing their desire to contest elections on our party ticket,"" Ghosh said. There is still time left to decide on the issue of candidates and tickets will be distributed on the basis of eligibility, winnability and capability of an individual, he said. Ghosh's views were echoed by party's Bengal Minority Morcha chief Ali Hossain, who felt Muslims are a deciding factor in the Bengal elections and the party cannot afford to ignore them. The ruling TMC, however, discounted BJP's minority outreach plan and asserted that they continue to have faith in party chief Mamata Banerjee. ""The minorities have full faith in us. The BJP's strategy is nothing but a farce and the minorities are very well aware of their intentions,"" senior TMC leader Partha Chatterjee said. 
The Congress and the CPM also pooh-poohed the BJP's Muslim outreach plan saying it was nothing but ""shedding crocodile tears"" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Ghosh claimed his party has expanded its base in Bengal by leaps and bounds and Muslims too are not out of its reach. ""We are running the government at the Centre and in more than 20 states, Muslims are living in peace and there are no problems. We believe in development for all,"" he said. According to state BJP sources, who did not wish to be named, in order to make party president Amit Shah's target of 22 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal a reality, it is a ""necessity"" for the party to reach out to the minorities as the community plays a deciding factor in at least 10-12 Lok Sabha seats of the state. Buoyed by its performance in the last panchayat polls, the West Bengal BJP has prepared its Lok Sabha blueprint, targeting 26-28 parliamentary seats in the state. The party presently has two Lok Sabha seats — Asansol and Darjeeling — in the state. The BJP's Bengal minority wing chief Ali Hossain said the ultimate decision on the candidates' selection would be of the party. ""We won't pressurise the party by saying that it has to field so many Muslim candidates. Everything will depend on various factors including whether he or she is able to win the seat or not,"" Hossain told PTI. The BJP minority morcha, West Bengal unit had last week organised a two-day conference to discuss various issues pertaining to the Muslim community. A number of morcha leaders decided to propagate issues ranging from triple talaq to the Assam NRC to counter the ""false propaganda"" against the party.",2018-10-30,"Ali Hossain,Amit Shah,Assam NRC,Bengal Minority Morcha,BJP,Candidates,Congress,CPM,Dilip Ghosh,Lok Sabha Election,Mamata Banerjee,Minorities,Muslims,NewsTracker,Partha Chatterjee,TMC,Vote-Bank,West Bengal",Lok Sabha Election 2019: BJP mulls fielding more Muslims in Bengal to make inroads into Mamata Banerjee’s solid support base,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/lok-sabha-election-2019-bjp-mulls-fielding-more-muslims-in-bengal-to-make-inroads-into-mamata-banerjees-solid-support-base-5470711.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday expressed confidence that ""political compulsions"" will bring together all non-BJP parties to fight the NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Naidu, who met several Opposition leaders in New Delhi in a run-up to forming a formidable front against the BJP in the upcoming general elections, said that he will play the role of a ""facilitator"" in helping evolve a credible alternative. ""It is only (because of) political compulsion and in the overall interest of the nation that parties will join together. Some may not join before elections, some of them may join after elections,"" he told reporters in Delhi. Some political parties are ""afraid"" to join today because of the pressure from the BJP, he said, adding he may even have to meet some leaders because of ""democratic compulsions"". Asserting that someone will act as a catalyst to form an alternative front, Naidu said that already leaders like TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal are making efforts towards that direction. ""Had a good meeting with Sh Chandrababu Naidu   (sic). Sh Sharad Yadav   was also present for a while. Discussed national issues. Present BJP govt is a threat to the nation n to the Constitution. People across India will need to join hands to save India and the Constitution,"" Kejriwal tweeted after meeting Naidu at the Andhra Bhawan in Delhi. Naidu also met former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday evening along with Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Y Ramakrishnudu and some TDP MPs. Mayawati's stand against the Congress ahead of the Assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh is being seen as a setback to form an opposition alliance against the BJP. Recently, Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan, who is trying to build support of ""neglected communities"" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, also tried to meet Mayawati. However, Naidu said that the TDP is a regional party in a state having 25 Lok Sabha seats and his role will be limited. ""Somebody will do, I will follow. I want to help the process to work together. If there is consensus, we will work together. I'm doing my bit. I'm acting as a process facilitator. I'm not interested in becoming the prime minister,"" he added. Naidu, a former BJP ally who quit the NDA early in 2018 over the Centre's refusal to grant special status to Andhra Pradesh, also met Jammu and Kashmir National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in the national capital. He, however, admitted that it would be a difficult exercise this time. On coalition government, the TDP chief said, ""If the leader is good and effective, development will take place even in coalition. In the past, more growth and development has taken place under coalition governments."" However, today there is ""no consensus"" and that is why the Central Government is committing so many mistakes, he said. Alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was victimising those who oppose him, Naidu said that income tax raids are being conducted ahead of Assembly polls in several states including Karnataka and now in Andhra Pradesh. ""The democracy is in danger. Institutions have collapsed. I don't want to comment on Rafale deal and the CBI. The ED and Income Tax department are being used against politicians. Tomorrow, they will attack me also. I never indulged in petty politics,"" he said. The minister claimed that since the TDP quit the NDA, the Central Government is neglecting Andhra Pradesh more and is not releasing funds for development as promised under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Even relief funds to Titli cyclone-hit districts has not been released, he claimed. ""Modi should have called the meeting of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Wherever they committed, they should have sorted out. Even sometimes if there were differences, that should have been addressed. That is the role of a prime minister. Despite that, the prime minister is creating problems among states. It is very unfortunate,"" he said. Expressing concern over the ""economic crisis"" under the NDA government, the TDP chief claimed the implementation of demonetisation, GST, growing NPAs and frauds have derailed the economic development and investors have lost confidence. Rupee devaluation and rising fuel prices have affected the people in the country, he added.",2018-10-28,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections Delhi,Andhara Pradesh,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,Congress,Grand Alliance,Mayawati,N.

Press Trust of India," The Congress on Saturday alleged that the Chief Vigilance Commission and the government were hand in glove in divesting CBI Director Alok Verma of his powers and termed it as a ""sinister conspiracy to put a lid on investigation"" into Rafale deal. The Opposition party questioned why CVC Commissioner KV Chowdary had ""abruptly cancelled"" his scheduled foreign tour to hold an urgent meet at night on 23 October on the matter and issued an ""illegal"" order against Verma. Addressing a joint press conference with AICC general secretary Ashok Gehlot, AICC media in-charge Randeep Surjewala claimed there were layers of drama in the late night that day wherein ""a fraud was played on the Constitution by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with CVC, which was now out in the open"". There was no immediate reaction from the CVC and the Prime Minister's Office on the Congress' allegations. The government had divested powers of Verma and CBI's Special Director Rakesh Asthana's in the early hours of 24 October, amid an ongoing spat between them. The decision to remove the two was based on the CVC's recommendations. ""Chowdary was scheduled to go on a tour to Denmark on October 23 (Tuesday) in the evening. He abruptly cancelled his tour and held a meeting of the Central Vigilance Commission at night,"" Surjewala claimed. On the same day at around 11 pm, CBI's joint director M Nageshwar Rao, was sent to CBI headquarter in anticipation of the CVC order, Surjewala claimed. Rao is now the interim chief of the CBI, but the apex court has barred him from taking any ""policy"" or ""any major decision"". Surjewala claimed that Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik called his subordinates at around 11:30 pm to alert to them about an urgent midnight operation. ""At 12:00 am, Delhi Police Commissioner received instructions from National Security Advisor and briefed Delhi Police officers for taking over the CBI headquarters by Delhi Police,"" he claimed. As the Delhi Police attempted to take control at the CBI headquarters at around 12.30 am, they were stopped by the CISF guarding the premises, Surjewala claimed. He claimed that Patnaik then spoke to the head of CISF, who also received instructions from the Prime Minister's Office/National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, to permit takeover of CBI premises by Delhi Police. On the other hand, between 8 pm and 12.30 am, CVC and his two colleagues drafted the recommendations for removal of Verma, Surjewala claimed. He alleged that the CVC order was taken to North Block, where Secretary Personnel, C Chandramouli was waiting as per instructions of PMO. ""Chandramouli then rushed to the PMO. Cabinet Committee on Appointments headed by Prime Minister, then, approved the removal of Alok Verma as the CBI Director and appointed, M Nageshwar Rao as the new CBI Director,"" he claimed. The Congress leader claimed that the CVC and Additional Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training then visited the CBI headquarters. At around 2.30 am, the CVC, the Additional Secretary and Rao, the then Joint Director, came out of the CBI headquarters with files and records, he claimed. Surjewala also posed questions to the government saying ""if the CVC did not have the powers to remove the CBI director then why did it help the government in conducting its nefarious conspiracy"". ""Has the CVC deliberately permitted himself to be misused by the government to carry of sinister conspiracy to put a lid on investigation into Rafale corruption?"" he said. The Congress has been persistently attacking the government on the Rafale deal, alleging corruption. The government has vehemently denied the allegations and has accused Congress leaders of spreading lies on the issue. ""What was the tearing hurry for the CVC to cancel his Denmark tour scheduled for October 23, call a midnight meeting and pass an illegal order for divesting the CBI Director, Alok Verma of all his duties?"" Surjewala said. The party also alleged that Rao was sent to CBI office at 11 pm on 23 October, even before the order naming him the interim chief of the agency was issued.",2018-10-27,"AICC,Alok Verma,CBI,Congress,CVC,India,Politics,Rakesh Asthana,Randeep Surjewala,TheySaidIt","Centre, CVC were hand in glove in action against CBI director Alok Verma: Congress",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/centre-cvc-were-hand-in-glove-in-action-against-cbi-director-alok-verma-congress-5458751.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sriram Karri," Buoyed by recent media reports that the Congress has possibly surged ahead of the ruling BJP in the three states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president Captain N Uttam Kumar Reddy predicts a larger national trend will reflect in the 2018 semi-finals, saying, Congress will sweep all the five states. A former Indian Air Force officer and fighter pilot, Captain Reddy flew MiG 21s and 23s before a near-fatal air accident left him unfit to continue with combat duty. He then worked with the Rashtrapathi Bhavan before serendipity led him into politics. As the president of Congress' Telangana unit, he is striving hard to lead Congress to a win and creating its own state government again in south India, after a series of debacles and losses left the national party with its least power representation across 29 state capitals. Dismissing the “stunt” of dissolving the Telangana Assembly early by Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief and caretaker chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhara Rao also known as KCR, Captain Reddy said, “I thank KCR. If his greed and superstition had not led him to dissolve the Telangana Assembly, we would have had only a 4-0 verdict. Thanks to him, the people can show their emphatic support for the Congress with a full five-finger fury."" Captain Reddy claims that the battle has turned around even though opinion polls and surveys points to a TRS win. Stating that advancing poll dates do not always work, Captain Reddy gives the examples of how the NDA government lost the Lok Sabha election in 2004 despite advancing the date and the fact that all surveys predicted a comeback. ""KCR knows that he has made a mistake and will be routed on 7 December. He can continue to posture till results are out on 11 December,"" he says. In the 2014 elections, TRS shocked Congress with a win. Even though it was Congress who created Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh, the party did not gain politically from the bifurcation, as per its estimations. Congress was routed in an angry post-bifurcation Andhra Pradesh. After his win, KCR poached leaders from the Telugu Desam Party and Congress, weakening them further. By the end of 2016, the Congress seemed too weak to challenge TRS, which had consolidated its position tremendously. Captain Reddy brought a turn around in Congress’s fortunes to an extent that the party is now credibly challenging KCR. The turnaround, coinciding with the rise of acceptance for Rahul Gandhi nationally and, slowly increasing despair within the BJP, however, has been old-fashioned. Captain Reddy has been working with Dalits, tribals, Muslim and women, travelling across the state, and building a social coalition. “The Congress had a traditional support with Dalits. The KCR government humiliated them since coming to power. The Nerella incident on 2 July, 2017, where he (KCR) had several Dalits arrested, and had them tortured when they protested against the sand mafia linked to his own family, became an emotional issue across the state. When TRS supported the police who illegally detained and tortured the Dalits, it brought to Congress its first major shot in the arm,"" says Captain Reddy, who, along with several other Congress leaders, have built a Dalit movement across the state since then. ""In what is surely a woman’s century, KCR has hurt women's sentiment by running the first-ever Telangana government without a single woman in the cabinet. He has stopped all funding and loans to DWCRA women's bodies. KCR will learn soon that no power can hold against the fury of women scorned,” said the former Indian Air Force Captain. Captain Reddy said that the KCR govt failed to fulfil several of the promises it made in 2014. “KCR promised to make a Dalit a chief minister once Telangana was formed. He promised two-bedroom houses for all Dalits, tribals, Muslims, OBCs and the poor. He also promised three acres of land to all Dalits and tribals. He promised to bring drinking water to every house and a job to every family. Not one of these have happened,” he said. In fact, the troika of promises of two-bedroom houses, jobs and water were crucial to not only bringing TRS to power but were deeply ingrained into the psyche of the people as legitimate aspirations. “Forget jobs for every youth or one in every family, even the over two lakh pending government vacancies have not been filled,” he adds. While the Muslims in Telangana are angry that the promise of 12 percent reservations has not materialised, parents are upset that scholarships for their children have not been released. ""During the Congress rule, the government used to regularly remit scholarships to all Dalit, tribal and OBC children. The TRS government has stopped paying scholarships. Far from fulfilling the promise of free education from KG-to-PG, even basic fees are not being paid,"" he says. Building on a promise of returning to a welfare-centric but growth-focussed government, Captain Reddy believes Congress has also succeeded in denting the Muslim vote by “exposing” the TRS by portraying KCR as a friend and partner of the BJP. “He has the elections brought upon early so he can fight the state elections with the AIMIM, and the Lok Sabha elections next year in alliance with the BJP,"" Reddy said. The Congress has formed alliance with the Telugu Desam Party, some Left parties and key intellectual leaders. The Dalit-Muslim coalition, along with support of the OBCs who have historically backed the TDP, despite the party having weakened considerably since 2014, believe there are many factors which suggest Congress may have a good shot at challenging or even defeating the TRS. The simmering anger amongst Dalits and tribals, the rising suspicion amongst Muslims about TRS being an ally of the BJP, besides unemployed youth and unempowered women, are all beginning to reflect as Congress leaders campaign through the state. “Wherever I go people tell me we are waiting to oust TRS and bring back Congress. It is the same in all five states. This is the beginning of the end for the Modi-KCR axis fashioned after the Hitler-Stalin pact,” says Captain Reddy, heading to his next meeting with farmers, for whom his party has announced a loan waiver of Rs 2 lakh in a single instalment.",2018-10-28,"AIMIM,Andhra Pradesh Bifurcation,Captain Uttam Kumar Reddy,Congress,Dalit-Muslim Coalition,Dalits,KCR,OBCs,Reservation,Telangana Poll Issues,Telangana Polls,Telangana Rashtra Samiti,Telangna Assembly Election 2018,Telugu Desam Party,TheySaidIt","Congress will sweep Telangana, people are angry at KCR's broken promises, says Captain Uttam Kumar Reddy",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-will-sweep-telangana-people-are-angry-at-kcrs-broken-promises-says-captain-uttam-kumar-reddy-5459661.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," After labelling them as betrayers, AIADMK on Saturday extended an olive branch to its 18 disqualified MLAs, asking them to jump on to the ruling party bandwagon and flayed AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran for ""misleading"" them. Asking the debarred MLAs and other Dhinakaran loyalists who moved away from AIADMK to revert to the parent party, the top leadership asked them to ""understand the reality"" of the Madras High Court judgement that upheld their disqualification. The AIADMK indicated that the court ruling vindicated its stand and reminded them that the party was akin to an ""army"" when it came to discipline.

Ramakrishna Upadhya,"Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda is a political genius. Besides knowing how to invoke God to help him, he can even make his rivals to come to his side. Getting Siddaramaiah to shake hands with him after a gap of 12 years is the latest example. Gowda’s first act of genius was to get the Congress to hand over the chief ministership to his family, though his party had won less than one-sixth of the total number of Assembly seats. On 15 May, 2018, when the Karnataka Assembly results were pouring in, Gowda was glued to the telly at home. The frown on his brows, which grew deeper as the BJP’s seats' tally crossed the half-way mark, eased considerably when the BJP’s graph took a downturn, and settled at 104. Someone present at Gowda’s home heard him remark: ""Now it’s all God’s game."" It is part of history that senior Congress leaders Ashok Gehlot and Ghulam Nabi Azad rushed to Deve Gowda’s residence and offered their party’s unconditional support to HD Kumaraswamy to become the chief minister of the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition government in Karnataka. God, with a bit of assistance from Gowda, had fulfilled the Gowda family’s wish, though the JD(S) had won a mere 37 seats in the 224-member Assembly. Former chief minister Siddaramaiah, who was crestfallen at the Congress’s defeat, expressed his reservations about the deal, but he was firmly brushed aside by Gehlot, who was in constant touch with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Ever since the Kumaraswamy government took oath of office on 23 May, stability has eluded it, both because of internal strife in the Congress and sporadic attempts by the BJP to lure some of the MLAs to its side. Siddaramaiah, who assumed the dual role of leader of the Congress legislature party and chairman of the coordination committee, has added his own 'spice' from time to time to keep the government on tenterhooks. Many senior Congress leaders believe that more than the personal animosity with the Gowda family, Siddaramaiah’s actions were intended to protect the interests of the Congress. They reckon that it's easier to handle an external enemy like the BJP, but the JD(S) being an 'internal rival', dependant largely on the same voter base, can cause far more damage to the party in the guise of 'opposition unity'. Even as the Congress was grappling with how to respond to some of Kumaraswamy’s unilateral decisions, especially on loan waiver for farmers, and the rising disquiet within the party over the delay in expansion of the cabinet, the announcement of by-elections by the Election Commission came as a temporary reprieve to the leaders. The by-elections to two Assembly and three Lok Sabha seats will act as a trial run to the mega fight during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The JD(S)-Congress combine will be facing the elections together for the first time, and it has already caused some jitters in the BJP camp. Anitha Kumaraswamy, contesting from Ramanagaram Assembly seat vacated by her husband Kumaraswamy, is expected to win comfortably, but LR Shivarame Gowda, fighting from the Mandya Lok Sabha seat as a stop-gap candidate to make way for either Deve Gowda or his grandson Prajwal Revanna in the 2019 LS election, may require all of Gowda clan's backing to sail through. From Jamkhandi in north Karnataka, the Congress is playing the emotional card by fielding Anand Nyamagouda, the son of former MLA Siddu Nyamagouda, who died in a road accident. The BJP is banking on Srikanth Kulkarni, who had lost narrowly last time. In Bellari, the BJP has put up J Shantha, the sister of Sriramulu, who had won by a margin of one lakh votes last time. Though the Congress has five MLAs in the region, it was unable to resolve the competing demands of local leaders and has brought in VS Ugrappa, a rank outsider and a Siddaramaiah loyalist as its candidate. Yet another round of dynastic politics will be witnessed in Shivamogga as the BJP is fielding BY Raghavendra, the son of state President BS Yeddyurappa, while the JD(S)' candidate is Madhu Bangarappa, the son of late chief minister S Bangarappa. There has been a lot of heartburn within the Congress for 'surrendering' this seat to the JD(S), which it has never won and which had remained a Congress bastion until Yeddyurappa made it his stronghold. But pulling in Madhu Bangarappa at the last minute to contest from here is a masterstroke which only Deve Gowda could have come up with. Madhu has nurtured his late father's constituency, even winning once from one of the Assembly segments and S Bangarappa remains a legend in these parts, winning multiple times to the Assembly and the Lok Sabha, irrespective of the party he represented. Siddaramaiah and Deve Gowda — who have pledged to forget their past bitter relations and move on — are expected to hold a few joint campaigns, introducing new dynamics to the elections. How the grassroots-level workers of both the Congress and the JD(S) will view this new bonhomie and how the electorate themselves will perceive it remains to be seen. One thing is clear: Deve Gowda not only has the Congress now relying on his tactical brilliance to take on the BJP in Karnataka, but possibly, he has also ensured that the state government headed by his son will continue beyond 2019.",2018-10-28,"Bellari Bypolls,Congress-JDS Alliance,HD Deve Gowda,HD Kumaraswamy,Jamkhandy Bypolls,Karnataka,Karnataka Assembly Election 2018,Karnataka Bypolls,PoliticsDecoder,Ramanagaram Bypolls,Shivamogga Bypolls,Siddaramaiah","Siddaramaiah, HD Deve Gowda shake hands after 12 years: Ex-PM's tactical brilliance has ensured Kumaraswamy's rule beyond 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/siddaramaiah-hd-deve-gowda-shake-hands-after-12-years-ex-pms-tactical-brilliance-has-ensured-kumaraswamys-rule-beyond-2019-5460791.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The Congress is banking on a combination of new faces and old-timers in ticket distribution to end its 15-year wait to rule Chhattisgarh, which goes to polls next month. The Opposition party, late on Saturday evening, released a list of candidates — its third — for 37 Assembly seats going to polls in the second and last phase of voting on 20 November. It has renominated 15 sitting MLAs and fielded 11 candidates who had lost in 2013, besides giving tickets to 11 fresh faces. No sitting MLA was denied a ticket in the third list. However, only three women figure in it. A Congress leader said the party is ensuring that representation is given to all sections of society. ""It is a completely balanced list wherein the party has given representation to leaders belonging to all sections of society,"" claimed the head of the Chhattisgarh Congress communication wing, Shailesh Nitin Trivedi. ""Candidates were selected on the basis of the party's survey and performances of leaders,"" he said, adding that it is a ""well-planned strategy"" to win the upcoming election. The two lists released earlier contained 18 names. With this, the Opposition party has, so far, announced 55 candidates in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh, which has a 90-member House. State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel (Patan seat), Congress Legislative Party leader TS Singhdeo (Ambikapur), senior Congress leader Satyanarayan Sharma (Raipur Rural) and prominent tribal leader Amarjeet Bhagat (Sitapur) were among the sitting MLAs who were given tickets. In the last Assembly polls, 26 Congress sitting MLAs, including prominent leaders like Rampukar Singh, Ravindra Choubey, Amitesh Shukla and Mohammad Akbar, had tasted defeat. This time, Singh (Pathalgaon-ST), Shukla (Rajim), Akbar (Kawardha) and Choubey (Saja) have been renominated from their respective seats. Chhattisgarh Congress working president Shiv Kumar Dahariya, who had lost the previous election from Bilaigarh (SC), has been fielded from Arang (SC) this time. Similarly, Guru Rudra Kumar, who had lost the 2013 election from Arang, has been given a ticket from Ahiwara (SC). A popular young Congress leader, Vikas Upadhyay, who had lost to BJP minister Rajesh Munat from Raipur West last time by a margin of 6,160 votes, has been renominated from the seat. He will take on Munat again. Among other leaders who have been given tickets despite losing the 2013 polls are Premsai Tekam (Pratappur) and Pratima Chandrakar (Durg Rural). Vinay Kumar Bhagat and Uttamdan Minj, who had lost the 2008 Assembly election from Jashpur and Kunkuri, respectively, have been fielded from the same seats this time. Vinay Jaiswal, an eye surgeon, Devendra Yadav, Ramkumar Yadav are among the fresh faces fielded by the party this time. Bhilai Municipal Corporation Mayor Devendra Yadav, a youth leader, has been fielded from the Bhilai Nagar seat, where he will take on state minister and sitting BJP MLA Premprakash Pandey. Jaiswal will contest from Manendragarh. Ramkumar Yadav, a prominent farmer leader, had contested from Chandrapur constituency as a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate in 2013 and had finished runner-up. He recently joined the Congress, which has given him ticket from Chandrapur. Voting in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases — on 12 November and 20 November — and counting will take place on 11 December. The first phase covers 18 seats spread across eight naxal-affected districts — Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Kanker, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon. The remaining 72 seats will see polling on 20 November. The ruling BJP has so far announced 78 candidates. In 2013, the BJP had won 49, the Congress 39, the BSP 1 and an Independent 1.

Press Trust of India," UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey on Sunday said former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia is ""no more relevant” vis-a-vis Ayodhya movement and his party is committed to build a Ram temple there. “The BJP stand is very clear. It is committed to building Ram Temple in Ayodhya. It is of the view that the Ram temple should be built through consensus or as per the way shown by the court. And, whenever, such circumstances arise, the party will always be ready,” Pandey told   in an interview. The Uttar Pradesh BJP chief's remarks came in the wake of Togadia's demand from the BJP government at the Centre to either enact a law or bring in an ordinance ""to fulfil its promise"" of building Lord Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Pandey said,  “As far as Togadia is concerned, he is no more relevant.""

FP Staff,"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   from 2012, which in turn quoted an unnamed leader in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Tharoor compared him to a ""scorpion sitting on a Shivling"". While speaking at the Bengaluru Literature Festival on Saturday, Tharoor said the prime minister's ""personality cult"" has not been popular with the RSS and has been a cause of frustration within the group. Tharoor said: ""There is an extraordinarily striking metaphor expressed by an unnamed RSS source to journalist Vinod Jose of    , in which they express their frustration with their inability to curb Modi. The man says: 'Modi is like a scorpion sitting on a Shivling; you can't remove him with your hand, and you cannot hit it with a   either.'"" The Congress MP went on to call the metaphor ""profound"", saying you can either get stung while trying to remove the scorpion, or you can undermine all the sacred tenets of the faith represented by the Shivling by using a slipper on the arachnid. ""Ultimately, you live with it with seething frustration,"" he said. Tharoor also said the analogy and the frustration of the RSS could be a clue to the complex dynamics shared between the Hindutva movement and the ""Moditva"" expression of it. However, he took to Twitter on Sunday to issue a clarification on the reports, which left out his reference to   article and only quoted him as making the scorpion-Shivling analogy. ""In view of the unseemly demonisation of an out-of-context remark today involving a scorpion metaphor, my book #TheParadoxicalPrimeMinister cites and footnotes this article — please see the last paragraph of this article,"" the Congress leader said, sharing Vinod Jose's profile of Modi from 2012. ""This comment (not by me) has been in the public domain for six years. RS Prasad making an issue of a 6-yr-old quote shows how little the BJP has to offer the nation. As for the media subserving the BJP's desire for 'controversy', when will this 'profession' develop any self-respect?""  Not long after reports on Tharoor's statement, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had demanded a response from Congress president Rahul Gandhi, calling the MP's remarks a ""horrific denunciation of Lord Mahadev."" ""While Rahul Gandhi claims to be a Shiv bhakt, one of his leaders has almost abused the sanctity of the Shivling and Lord Mahadev by referring to a chappal attack through unnamed sources,""  quoted him as saying. ""Please reply to this very horrific denunciation of Lord Mahadev by giving an apology to what Tharoor has done."" Union minister Giriraj Singh, too, criticised Tharoor, saying he would have been ""silenced"" had he made such a statement on a prime minister in Pakistan. ""This is India. Had he made such a statement in Pakistan, Tharoor would have been silenced. He hasn't insulted the prime minister; he has insulted crores of Hindus and Lord Shiv. All I'll say is that the Congress is crossing the line now,"" he was quoted as saying by  . Furthermore, according to  Tharoor, at the lit fest, also criticised the Centre for being the most centralised, top-heavy government in recent memory.

Press Trust of India,": Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi has said though he will fight the Congress tooth and nail in the upcoming state Assembly polls, he will not speak against the Gandhi family, with whom he shared warm relations during his long tenure in the grand old party. The real contest in November's state Assembly polls would be between his party, the Janta Congress Chhattisgarh JCC(J), which has formed an alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jogi told  . ""I have left the Congress and will campaign against the party in the Assembly election, but will not speak against the Gandhi family, which has always loved me,"" he said. Jogi was the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh. He was then with the Congress. Jogi left the Congress in 2016 and floated his own party. Asked about the allegations against United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra, the veteran leader said, ""I will not speak anything against any member of the Gandhi family even during elections. I have shared warm relations with the family for decades."" The four members of the Jogi family belong to three political parties. While Jogi and his son are in the JCC(J), Jogi's wife and daughter-in-law are in the Congress and the BSP respectively. Hitting out at the Congress, Jogi said it was a spent force which was nowhere in the contest in Chhattisgarh. ""The Congress neither has any face nor any organisation in the state. It has no leader and has become useless,"" he said, while asserting that the fight in the upcoming polls was between his party and the BJP. ""It is a one-on-one contest between the JCC(J)-BSP alliance and the ruling BJP and we will definitely win the election,"" Jogi said. He maintained that he was the chief ministerial face of the alliance, but added that he had still not decided whether to contest the Assembly polls or not. ""We are fighting the Congress and the BJP tooth and nail and our alliance will severely harm the poll prospects of both parties,"" Jogi said.

Press Trust of India," The alliance between Ajit Jogi's party and the BSP will hurt the BJP, which is under the ""illusion"" that the tie-up will hamper the Congress's prospects in the upcoming  , state Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel said Sunday. Baghel, who is seen as one of the contenders for the chief minister's post, along with other senior party leaders like TS Singhdeo and Charandas Mahant if the Congress comes to power in the BJP-ruled state, asserted that currently, there were no claimants for the top post and the matter would be decided only after the polls. ""There are no claimants (for the chief minister's post), and we will fight the election under a collective leadership. It is only after the polls that the Legislative Party and the party high-command will decide who will be the chief minister. This is not a contentious matter,"" he told   in a telephonic interview from Raipur. The Congress is seeking to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been governing the state since 2003, from power this time. When asked whether the alliance between the Ajit Jogi-led Janta Congress Chhattisgarh and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will cut into the Congress's vote share, Baghel said, ""No, because the BSP has just about 4 percent of the vote share and Jogi's vote base is also the same as that of the BSP. So I do not think it (the alliance) will make a big difference."" He claimed that the Jogi-BSP tie-up will harm the BJP, the Congress. Elaborating on his point, the state Congress chief said of the seats reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, the Congress had won just one in the 2013 Assembly polls, while the BJP had emerged victorious in nine. ""Their (Jogi-Mayawati's) support base comprises mostly members of the SC community. So, even if they get a few seats, which looks unlikely, it is the BJP's tally that will come down,"" Baghel added. On BJP leader Saroj Pandey's remarks that the Jogi-BSP alliance will hurt the Congress more in Chhattisgarh, he said the saffron camp was under the ""illusion"" that the tie-up will affect the opposition party. ""That is why they (the BJP) got the alliance done. Alone, Jogi was unable to harm the Congress, so the BSP was also tagged along with him. The Jogi factor will not work,"" Baghel added. On why the Congress failed to stitch-up alliances in the state, he said, ""As far as the BSP is concerned, talks were on and suddenly, we got to know that they had aligned with Jogi's party."" Baghel added that talks with the Gondwana Gantantra Party failed as the Congress offered two seats to the tribal outfit, but with a one-per cent vote share, it was asking for five-six seats. Asked if not projecting a chief ministerial face could hamper the party's chances in the upcoming polls, he pointed out that the BJP had fought the 2003 state election without projecting a chief ministerial candidate and the name of Raman Singh was announced for the top post only after the polls. There were very few instances when the Congress had announced a chief ministerial face beforehand, Baghel said. On whether the issue of chief ministership would breed ambition and factionalism within the party ranks, he said, ""These days, even seers have ambitions of becoming chief minister. We are not even seers, we are in politics. So, we aspire for a political position, but we are not so ambitious that we will cross the party's boundaries. All the leaders are working unitedly."" Asked about the BJP's ""Mission 65"", Baghel said the Congress was focussed on all the 90 Assembly seats in the state and it was confident of securing a clear majority. Taking a jibe at the BJP, he said in Gujarat also the saffron party had set a ""Mission 150"" target, but ended up with 99 seats. The state Congress chief has been embroiled in a controversy over his alleged involvement in a fake sex CD case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had last month filed a chargesheet, naming Baghel and some others as accused in the case related to a controversial CD allegedly featuring a state minister, who had rejected it as fake. The BJP has used the issue to target the Congress, while Baghel has claimed innocence and described it as a political attack. Asked about the case, the Congress leader dismissed it as a ""conspiracy"" of the BJP. The Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, 18 seats in the Naxalism-hit areas will go to the polls on 12 November. The second phase of polling for the remaining 72 seats will be held on 20 November and the results will be announced on 11 December. Baghel will contest the polls from Patan. In 2013, the BJP had formed the government in Chhattisgarh for the third consecutive time by winning 49 seats against the 39 of the Congress, but the opposition party had succeeded in narrowing the gap in terms of vote share. It had grabbed 40.3 percent votes, while the saffron party had garnered 41 percent votes.",2018-10-28,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Congress,JCC-BSP Tie Up,NewsTracker","Ajit Jogi-BSP tie-up will hurt BJP in Chhattisgarh polls, says state Congress president Bhupesh Baghel",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ajit-jogi-bsp-tie-up-will-hurt-bjp-in-chhattisgarh-polls-says-state-congress-president-bhupesh-baghel-5461921.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The DMK Friday alleged that film star Rajinikanth was a puppet in the hands of ""some persons"" and was being supported by ""communal"" elements. The party's mouthpiece questioned him on his recent statement about Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), a pre-cursor forum to his political party. In his communication to RMM members on Tuesday, the Tamil film superstar had said that he was committed to ushering in a change in the political horizon sans the trappings of money and lure of posts. He had also recalled his assertion last year that he will never allow those eyeing money and posts in his political innings and said it was not a mere rhetoric. Posing questions to Rajinikanth in the name of an ""innocent fan"" of the popular star, DMK mouthpiece 'Murasoli' asked if the actor was not really behind posts as claimed by him, he should have then started a movement on the lines of rationalist leader, the late E V Ramasamy Periyar. ""Dear leader, if your assertion that posts was not a consideration in your political entry, why did you announce that (the party) will contest from all (234 Assembly) seats in the next polls,"" the DMK said in its mouthpiece. ""You could then as well launch a party like Periyar and strive steadfastly for its ideals,"" the ""innocent fan"" asks. 
EV Ramasamy had led Dravidar Kazhagam, which aggressively promoted rationalism. The write-up was published in a question and answer format under the pseudonym 'Silanthi,' meaning spider in Tamil. On the actor's contention that he was aware of those genuinely working in the RMM, the ""innocent fan"" points out to the particular politician hobnobbing with Rajinikanth, saying he had always had a bad influence in his earlier stints in other parties.

FP Staff,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday hit the streets in the capital along with leaders of his party and its allies on the Rafale issue demanding ""reinstatement"" of CBI Director Alok Verma and courted arrest after dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a "" "" (thief). ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi is finishing every institution of the country because he wants to hide the corruption in the Rafale deal. He is attacking the CBI, Election Commission and other institutions. Chowkidar chor hai (Watchman is a thief),"" he said in a brief address to a crowd of Congress workers outside the CBI headquarters in Lodhi Road area in south Delhi. Linking the government's action of divesting CBI Director Alok Verma of his powers, duties and functions with the controversy over the Rafale contract, the Congress president alleged that the prime minister had benefited a businessman to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore through this deal. ""The Congress will not allow the ' ' to commit this theft. The Opposition parties will not allow the ' ' to commit the theft,"" Rahul said amid frenzied slogan shouting by party supporters. Rahul got on to a truck in front of the police barricades put up ahead of the CBI headquarters in the CGO complex to prevent the protesters from reaching the building. Standing atop the vehicle, Rahul shouted "" "". The crowd roared as it repeated the slogan in unison before courting arrest. Rahul was leading a noisy protest over the government's action in CBI. He was flanked by party leaders Bhupinder Hooda, Ahmed Patel, Ashok Gehlot and Randeep Singh Surjewala as well as Opposition leaders Nadeemul Haque (Trinamool Congress), D Raja (CPI) and Sharad Yadav (Loktantrik Janata Dal). Carrying placards against the prime minister, the protesters walked the distance with scores of police personnel maintaining vigil and camera crews jostling with each other to capture the moment. Later, Rahul and other leaders were taken to the Lodhi Colony police station in a police bus and Surjewala tweeted that Rahul and other leaders have been arrested. ""Rahul Gandhi's arrest by an autocratic Modi government won't deter or cow down millions of Congress workers from exposing the dismantling of the CBI to hide the Rafale scam,"" he said. Gehlot said the Congress was staging protests outside CBI offices throughout the country with the demand that Verma be reinstated. ""We want the reinstatement of Alok Verma. He can be transferred only by the collegium of Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and Leader of Opposition. The Prime Minister should tender an apology to the nation for destroying the image of CBI,"" he said. Later, the leaders were let off. ""The prime minister can run and run but cannot hide from the truth. The truth will come out. The prime minister acted out of fear and panic (on the issue). The prime minister cannot give a rupee in waiver for farmers. Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya, Mehul Choksi, Lalit Modi all fled. Anil Ambani will also flee. The reality is that the prime minister has indulged in corruption.  ,"" he roared. Earlier, Rahul led a short march from Dayal Singh College to the CBI headquarters along with opposition leaders. Hundreds of Congress activists took part in the protest, shouting slogans against Modi. The government has   its decision, saying it was ""absolutely essential"" to maintain the CBI's institutional integrity and the move was based on recommendations by the Central Vigilance Commissioner. The Congress' protests in the national capital were replicated in other parts of the country. State Congress leaders led demonstrations in their regions against what the Congress described as the ""illegal, unconstitutional and illegitimate removal of the CBI director by the Modi-Shah duo that has shamed India and its premier investigative agency"". Alleging that the prime minister is experiencing 'Rafale-o-Phobia', the opposition party said the ""demolition of the CBI"" was prompted by fears that the director was going to conduct a probe into the fighter jet deal. The government sent Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana, who have accused each other of corruption, on leave on Tuesday. It also transferred several CBI officials and appointed M Nageswar Rao as the interim chief of the agency. The Congress protest was held soon after the matter came up in the Supreme Court. The   former Supreme Court judge AK Patnaik will oversee a CVC inquiry into the allegations and counter allegations and the report has to be placed before it within two weeks. It directed that interim CBI chief M Nageswara Rao shall not take any major policy decisions. Decisions taken by him since 23 October till date shall not be implemented, it said. All decisions taken by Rao shall be placed before the apex court in a sealed cover. The court sought a response from the CBI, the CVC and the Centre on Verma's plea challenging the government's decision to divest him of his duties.

Press Trust of India,"The Mizo National Front (MNF), a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), Friday reiterated that it would not form an alliance with the BJP for the upcoming election to the 40-member Mizoram Assembly scheduled to be held on November 28. MNF secretary for information and publicity Lalthanzuala Hnamte cited a   online news report to say that there were claims in the local media that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the MNF have reached an agreement to forge an alliance. The news report said Tripura BJP general secretary Pratima Bhowmik has indicated that in a fractured post-poll scenario the opposition MNF may form a coalition with the BJP to form a government. Bhowmik was also quoted as saying that the MNF could not have a pre-poll alliance because of a genuine fear of backlash from the majority Mizo voters but when the question of government formation will come up there will be no difficulty in forming a post-poll alliance or coalition. ""Distorting the statement of the Tripura BJP leader, people are spreading rumours to tarnish the image of the MNF, saying that the Mizo party and the BJP have reached an understanding in case of a hung assembly,"" Hnamte said.

K Nageshwar,"An ugly political war has erupted over the attack on   on Thursday. The incident, instead of raising security concerns, soon assumed political colours, with both the TDP and the YSR Congress accusing each other of hatching a conspiracy to gain political mileage. The Opposition YSR Congress president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy sustained an injury when a waiter at a restaurant stabbed him with a small knife at the VIP lounge of the Visakhapatnam airport on Thursday. The government has announced the setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the incident. However, even before the probe began, the state chief minister held a press conference to dismiss the incident as a propaganda strategy by the Opposition leader. N Chandrababu Naidu, in a hurriedly called late night press conference, said that the accused has confessed that he is an admirer of Reddy and that he carried out such an attack only to ensure sympathy for his idol. Interestingly, Naidu also made a reference to the so-called Operation Garuda, in which actor Sivaji said that the BJP-led central government is hatching a conspiracy to destabilise the TDP government. In his claim, Sivaji had said that a non-lethal attack on Reddy would take place and subsequently, the state would witness disturbances and rioting engineered by north Indian gangs. He had further predicted that the Centre would dismiss the Naidu government for its failure to control the riots. The chief minister, in his press conference on Thursday, said that if one looks at the sequence of events, everything is happening as Sivaji has predicted. He also alleged that the BJP scripted this attack as he has been fighting against the ‘injustice’ meted out by the Centre to Andhra Pradesh. It was surprising that Naidu gave credence to such unsubstantiated claims from a person who is neither an expert on security nor on politics. Why did the state government not take precautionary measures, if it really believed the story? Why did the police and intelligence officials fail to procure more details from Sivaji? The chief minister and his cabinet colleagues have no answers. TDP leaders have termed the incident a cheap tactic adopted by the YSR Congress to generate sympathy for its leader ahead of polls. On the other hand, YSR Congress leaders have described the incident as a conspiracy that the state government failed to check. The TDP explained that the incident occurred at an airport, the security of which is the responsibility of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) which is under the Union government. The state DGP RP Thakur also clarified that the state police has nothing to do with airport security. Surprisingly, the state police chief also joined the political cacophony by corroborating the TDP’s allegations. The police hastily concluded that the accused is an admirer of Reddy. Mahendra Patrudu, additional deputy commissioner of police, Visakhapatnam said that the alleged attacker, J Srinivasa Rao, is a fan of Reddy. L Arjun, assistant commissioner of police, west zone, also made the same statement, and said that the accused committed the act for publicity. Ambati Rambabu, spokesperson of the YSR Congress, said that the SIT would also end up stating what the police and the ruling political establishment have already been saying. The YSR Congress has already approached the high court seeking an independent investigation. The YSR Congress has described the attack as an attempt to murder its leader. It has also described the incident as an abject failure of the Naidu government. Naidu, on his part, has not put forward any concrete evidence to substantiate his allegations against the BJP. Meanwhile, the BJP, which has of late taken a strident anti-TDP position, seems to be coming to the rescue of the YSR Congress. The saffron party has called for the dismissal of the Chandrababu Naidu government. The BJP's remarks have only provided ammunition to the claims of Naidu and the so-called revelations on Operation Garuda, about the central government conspiring against Andhra Pradesh and its government. The Telugu media, known for its political partisanship, joined the preposterous battle by giving disproportionate coverage to the claims and counter-claims. The social media networks of both parties plunged into action, adding fuel to the fire. The democratic discourse, which is crucial during the election season, seems to have become a casualty. The polarisation between two parties and individuals does not, in any way, serve the cause of the people, as their issues are relegated to the back burner.",2018-10-26,"Andhra Pradesh,BJP,Chandrababu Naidu,PoliticalPlay,Sivaji,TDP,Visakhapatnam,YS Jagan Mohan Reddy,YSR Congress","Attack on Jagan Mohan Reddy: Andhra Pradesh govt sets up SIT to probe incident; TDP, YSR Congress trade charges",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/attack-on-jagan-mohan-reddy-andhra-pradesh-govt-sets-up-sit-to-probe-incident-tdp-ysr-congress-trade-charges-5454431.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,"The Congress on Wednesday said it would rejuvenate the entire education system within 100 days of coming to power in Telangana, if elected after the 7 December Assembly polls, by strengthening government institutions and extending all support to managements of private institutions. Alleging that the TRS government had ruined the careers of lakhs of students by not clearing fee reimbursement dues, a senior party leader promised that the next Congress government (if voted to power), would pay fee reimbursement amount every year in two instalments. There would be 100 percent fee reimbursement for students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes and minority communities, a party release quoted Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee President N Uttam Kumar Reddy as saying. He said 20,000 teachers would be recruited within 100 days. Accusing the TRS government of doing nothing to control the 'exorbitant' fee structure of corporate institutions, Reddy also assured that steps would be taken to regulate corporate schools and colleges. He assured managements of private educational institutions and their association that the Grand Alliance of Congress, TDP and other parties would include their issue in the Common Agenda and resolve them on a priority basis after coming to power in the next assembly elections. Addressing a meeting organised by the 'KG to PG Educational Institutions Joint Action Committee' here, Reddy accused caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao of cheating the people of Telangana on the promise of free education from Kindergarten to Post graduate level. There are nearly 85 lakh students across Telangana in various classes from KG to PG who expected that KCR's (as Rao is popularly known as) scheme would benefit them, he said. ""However, by setting up a few residential schools which cater to not more than one lakh students, KCR thinks he fulfilled the promise of KG to PG free education,"" he said. Reddy said over 12,000 schools, about 2,000 junior colleges, nearly 1,000 degree colleges, 200 PG colleges, 600 professional colleges and 500 B.Ed. and D.Ed. colleges with a combined strength of 46 lakh students were being run by private managements. They also provide employment to nearly five lakh people, including teaching and non teaching staff. He said they had also played a major role, not only in the formation of Telangana, but in formation of the TRS government in the state. However, KCR 'humiliated' them on multiple occasions and denied appointment even to discuss their problems, he alleged.

BJP president Amit Shah and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar made this announcement in a brief interaction with the media on Friday. Shah also assured that Upendra Kushwaha and Ram Vilas Paswan will remain a part of the alliance in 2019. The BJP chief also said that apart from the saffron party and the JD(U), other members of the alliance will also get a respectable seat share, and the numbers will be announced in a few days.

Debobrat Ghose,"With party president Rahul Gandhi leading from the front, the Congress appears to have rediscovered its qualities in protesting. The Rafale deal and the in-house factional fight within the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have allowed the party to spring back into an aggressive mode. For the first time after the defeat of 2014, the party is getting even with the BJP. It has also managed to put Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a spot of bother. It can only be good news for the dispirited cadre ahead of the elections of 2019. As Rahul courted arrest on Friday over affairs in the country's premier investigating agency after a street protest, what mattered more was the optics, not the content. It appeared to be a strategy to hog the limelight. But he has been scoring several points through such protests. By keeping the Rafale heat on, Rahul is denting the image of incorruptibility of the prime minister. The prime minister till date enjoys an impeccable image, with high personal integrity. Whether in poll campaigns or public rallies or press conferences, the Congress president has continuously been dubbing Modi as “ ” (thief). Along with the Rafale issue, the fresh CBI fiasco has been added to Congress’ ammunition against Modi and the NDA government. After taking a short march on Friday from Dayal Singh College to CBI headquarters, Rahul addressed a crowd comprising party workers and public at Lodhi Road area in New Delhi, and said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is finishing every institution of the country because he wants to hide the corruption in the Rafale deal. He is attacking the CBI, Election Commission and other institutions.   (the watchman is a thief)…The Congress won’t allow the c  to commit this theft."" By highlighting the fracas in the CBI through a pan-India protest, Rahul has been hitting out at the good governance claim of Modi. The infighting and mudslinging between the agency director Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana has caused enough embarrassment for the government. As a result, both have been asked to go on leave. Congress, by repeatedly picking up issues like statements made by Union ministers on Rafale, bank scams related to Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi or the latest CBI incident, has been trying to weave a narrative of ‘poor governance of Modi government’ ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls this year and 2019 Lok Sabha election. Through constant protests, Rahul is in fact burnishing his own image as a leader. Right from staging an aggressive protest demonstration against the government on street to courting arrest, he has tried to give a public message that the voters can depend on him and his party. His moves are likely to enthuse the cadre, which had seen no street action from a top leader for a long time. Whether it was on the streets of Bhopal or Hyderabad or elsewhere, the state Congress leaders and workers replicated Rahul in their respective domains. Not long ago, all BJP leaders were dismissive of Rahul, taking his acumen as a leader lightly. Now, he is taking the battle directly to the BJP camp. While he has been raising issues of farmers and other disprivileged groups in rallies in BJP-ruled states, he has also been trying to depict the prime minister in poor light. His assertiveness has put the BJP in a spot of trouble. In the face of uncomfortable truths, they can no more lampoon him. And they know no other way to handle him. Rahul is also drawing positive response from the crowds. Mocking Rahul as ‘ ’ may boomerang for the BJP. On 6 May, 2016, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi   at Parliament Street police station after Congress’ ‘Save Democracy’ rally, which was led by the party president. Like on Friday, the Congress had charged Modi with ‘pursuing a strategy to destroy Congress’. Besides raking up the issue of AgustaWestland and raising slogans on streets, the Congress had referred to the toppling of its governments in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as “murder of democracy”. However, unlike Friday’s street rally and the eventual arrests of Congress leaders, the 2016 protest was more personalised, more restricted to the party’s own position. Today, the amplifying effect was more as people on the streets could easily connect with the CBI issue. The word ‘CBI’ and corruption issues related to this premier investigative agency are anyway catchier than issues related to AgustaWestland or even the Rafale Deal for a common man. The repeated slogan of Rahul – “c ” — has found a strong resonance with the common man. The detention of the Congress president today attracted more eyeballs than in 2016, which was tepid and less aggressive.",2018-10-27,"BJP,CBI,Congress,CriticalPoint,Politics,Prime Minister Narendra Modi,Rafale Deal,Rahul Gandhi",Rahul Gandhi leads protests over CBI row: BJP can no longer dismiss Congress president by simply mocking him,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-leads-protests-over-cbi-row-bjp-can-no-longer-counter-congress-president-by-simply-mocking-him-5454301.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah Saturday threw his weight behind the Sabarimala protesters, while slamming the Left-wing state government for 'repressing' Hindu culture and customs by using brute force. Speaking at a public meeting in Kannur, Shah said, ""The BJP will take over the protest of the Ayyappa devotees. We will not mind throwing out the Kerala government if it tries to steamroll the traditions of the Sabarimala temple,"" said Shah. Addressing a congregation of BJP workers in Kerala's Kannur district, Shah condemned the massive police crackdown on the thousands of BJP, RSS and right-wing workers who were  women's entry to the Sabarimala shrine. ""These people have booked over 2,600 people under non-bailable sections of the IPC, merely for protesting to protect their religion. I want to ask them, whose property have they vandalised to be charged under such stringent sections,"" Shah said. The women's entry to the hill shrine devoted to Lord Ayyappa remains a sensitive issue   upholding women's right to enter the shrine and pray there. The traditionalists argue that Lord Ayyappa devotees, irrespective of their caste, religion or gender are welcome to every other temple, however, the Sabarimala shrine holds a special status owing to the celibate status of the deity worshiped there. Massive protests were held by thousands of devotees, including women, blocking the way of the handful of women who tried to scale the hill top to reach the shrine in Kerala's Pathanamthitta district. However, the Left Democratic Front government in the state has accused BJP and RSS to bring in their political cadres to amplify the protest and use it to brew law and order problems in the Left-ruled state. Meanwhile, unflinching in his attack, Shah admitted that   to stand ""rock solid"" beside Lord Ayyappa devotees fighting to preserve Hindu traditions. Pledging to stand like a rock beside Lord Ayyappa supporters, Shah said that he was here to warn the communist government. ""The communist government is attacking Lord Ayyappa's shrine, and they are fiddling with the Devaswom board. They are using the Supreme Court's judgment to suppress the devotees,"" Shah said. He also claimed that the Hindu religion was inherently respectful towards women, but argued that this was not a battle of gender rights but of protecting one's culture and traditions. ""It is not a matter of women's right. Hindu religion is not anti-women,"" Shah said. ""We have several temples where men's entry is not allowed. Gender parity does not merely comes from entering a temple,"" Shah said. He claimed that when it comes to women's rights, Hindus have already gotten rid of regressive customs to incorporate higher degree of gender parity in their religion ""whether it is widow remarriage, or outlawing polygamy and child marriage"", but when it is ""a question of our faith, we will stand rock solid beside the Lord Ayyappa devotees"". He also advised the courts to weigh in on the practical aspects of implementation before passing such orders. ""I would like to urge the courts and governments also to pass orders that can be implemented,"" Shah said. He said: ""While those fighting for women's entry are quoting Fundamental Rights under Article 24 of the Constitution, even I have a fundamental right to practice my religion under Article 25 and 26. Then how can one Fundamental Right supersede over another,"" Shah asked. He also questioned the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government's motives behind   in such haste. He said that he can quote several judgments by the Supreme Court that could not be implemented due to people's sentiments, including the Jallikattu judgment and the verdict outlawing use of loudspeakers in mosques. ""Then why is the government hell bent on implementing this one judgment,"" Shah asked. ""Kerala is facing an Emergency-like situation, because the Kerala government is exploiting innocent devotees in the name of the Supreme Court judgment,"" he said, adding that the protesters were not any men brought from outside but the state's subjects and primarily women devotees of Lord Ayyappa, requesting others to uphold their tradition. Shah was in Kerala's Kannur to inaugurate a new party office. He said that the building holds testimony to the blood sacrifice given by hundreds of BJP workers in the district to protect their ideology. Condemning the political violence in Kerala, Shah said that at least 120 workers got killed in Kannur fighting to protect their ideology. Terming Kannur BJP's gateway to Kerala, Shah said that no Left government can truly develop the state. He said that Kerala can make progress under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. Criticising the state government on several other issues as well, Shah said that Vijayan had no right to remain in power because he failed to provide relief to flood victims in the state. He claimed that the Modi government had launched several development and infrastructural projects for the state, but the chief minister had no time to spare to sort out land acquisition for implementation of these projects. Shah said that Vijayan was preoccupied by lathi charging innocent women devotees and tribals protesting to preserve their faith. The BJP chief's visit assumes significance as the saffron party in the state is on the warpath against the CPM-led LDF government over its decision to implement the Supreme Court order allowing entry of women of all ages into the Lord Ayyappa's hill shrine. A bypoll is also due at Manjeswaram Assembly segment at Kasargod following the death of sitting IUML MLA PA Abdul Razak earlier this month. IUML is a partner in the Congress-led UDF Opposition.

The government and power that he enjoys are because of the grace of God and support of Congress MLAs, Kumaraswamy said and added only they have the strength to take it back. Mandya Lok Sabha constituency that comes under the old Mysuru region is dominated by Vokkaligas, a community considered a strong vote base to JD(S). JD(S)' ally Congress is supporting the party candidate Shivarame Gowda by not fielding its candidate. As Congress too has considerable vote base in the region, a section of local party leaders and workers are said to have reservation about their leadership's decision to leave the seat for JD(S).",2018-10-27,"2019 Lok Sabha Electionns,BJP,Comgress,HD Kumaraswamy,Israel,JD(S),Karanataka,Malavalli,Mandya,NewsTracker",HD Kumaraswamy gets emotional at election rally; says he is living to serve the people of Karnataka,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/hd-kumaraswamy-gets-emotional-at-election-rally-says-he-is-living-to-serve-the-people-of-karnataka-5456521.html,firstpost,-1,0
Srinivasa Prasad,"Having an extra-marital affair with the neighbour’s wife is adultery. But how about simply looking at her? And what if we call even that infidelity? If that sounds a bit harsh, that’s what India’s anti-defection law is — and for good reason. The law says a legislator who resigns from a party on whose ticket he has been elected to a House and either forms or joins another party must be disqualified from the membership of the House. But defection doesn’t necessarily mean resignation or even voting against the party. It can even mean an intended or implied desertion from the party. The Supreme Court made that clear in its 2007 verdict in the   case. The case was about 13 BSP MLAs of Uttar Pradesh who met the governor in August 2003 and asked him to call the Opposition leader to form the government. The MLAs hadn’t actually resigned. The five-judge bench said: “Even in the absence of a formal resignation from the membership, an inference can be drawn from the conduct of a member that he has voluntarily given up his membership of the political party to which he belongs.” There was also the  case in which Justice SC Agarwal of the Supreme Court ruled in 1994: “A person may voluntarily give up his membership of a political party even though he has not tendered his resignation from the membership of that party.” Even in the latest Tamil Nadu case, the 18 MLAs whose disqualification from the Assembly was upheld by the Madras High Court on 25 October hadn’t actually resigned from AIADMK. They hadn’t even asked the governor to call another party leader to form the government. They only met the governor in August 2017 and told him that they had lost faith in the leadership of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and requested him to begin a “constitutional process”. This was enough for Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee, as part of a two-judge bench, to rule in June 2018 that the action of the MLAs amounted to defection. Justice Banerjee, now a Supreme Court judge, upheld the Tamil Nadu Speaker’s action in disqualifying the 18 MLAs from being members of the Assembly. When her fellow judge Justice M Sundar dissented, the case was heard by a third judge, Justice M Sathyanarayanan, who too upheld the disqualification on Thursday. The story doesn’t end there. The MLAs have now decided to move the Supreme Court to  challenge Justice Sathyanarayanan’s well-argued verdict. Their decision has as much to do with their lack of preparedness to face elections again in their seats as with their hopes to cash in on technicalities and other loopholes to overturn their disqualification in the apex court. The Palaniswami government could fall if the 18 defectors are allowed to remain MLAs and vote against the chief minister in a trust vote. It’s easier to play the game of numbers than fight elections. Few will shed tears if and when the Palaniswami government collapses.  An   poll says his is by far the most unpopular state government that exists in the country now. More than the fate of a derelict, shaky government that owes itself existence to nothing more than the legacy of a dead leader — Jayalalithaa — what matters is how defectors continue to wreak havoc on India’s parliamentary apparatus despite a harsh law, and how they desperately seek to legitimise floor-crossing by playing a game of judicial musical chairs. The fight against defections supposedly began in 1973 when Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister, made a half-hearted move to ban political defections, a phenomenon that she herself had initiated and unabashedly nurtured. The move never took off. The Janata Party government of Morarji Desai made another feeble attempt by bringing in an Anti-Defection Bill in 1978 but members of both the ruling party and the Opposition scuttled it. During the 1984 elections, called after Indira’s assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi promised to bring in an anti-defection law and made good that promise in February 1985 after he became the prime minister. He brought in the anti-defection law by way of the 52  amendment to the Constitution. The law finds a pride of place in the Constitution’s Tenth Schedule. Rajiv Gandhi was hailed as a hero of political reforms — hailed by himself and his partymen. The amendment, in fact, seemed to be aimed more at curbing desertions from his own Congress (I), as his party was then called, especially when elections to as many as 11 state Assemblies were round the corner at that time. LK Advani, then the general secretary of BJP, said the anti-defection law was meant to silence dissent in Congress-I which had no inner-party democracy. Whatever the motive of Rajiv Gandhi was in bringing in the law, it has had little effect in curbing this evil in the 33 years it has been in existence. The   only confirms how tough it is for the court to interpret and enforce the Tenth Schedule. This is what the relevant law says: In the latest Tamil Nadu case, 2(1)(b) is not applicable since there was no voting involved. So the key question was whether the action of the MLAs in merely meeting the governor and telling him they had lost their faith in the chief minister and then requesting him to set off a “constitutional process” amounted to voluntarily giving up the membership of AIADMK. But Justice Banerjee had this to say in her verdict: “The question is, what does this (Constitutional process) mean?  What is it that the Governor could do? ... the Governor could either have recommended imposition of President’s Rule, in which case the Government formed by the party on whose ticket the 18 MLAs had been elected would have been ousted or alternatively, called for a floor test, in which case also the party on whose ticket the writ petitioners were elected, led by the Chief Minister, Mr. E. Palaniswami, which had a very thin majority, would have collapsed, since the writ petitioners would obviously vote against the Chief Minister, as other opposition parties would do.” Dissenting, Justice Sundar took the view that as past Supreme Court verdicts had made it clear, the governor had no role in “changing” a chief minister and so, the petitioners had gone to the “wrong forum” even if their intention was to replace Palaniswami. He said: “However, going to the wrong forum alone will not attract ingredients of paragraph 2(1)(a) unless there is buttressing material.” So, he quashed the Speaker’s decision. Justice Sathyanarayanan, the third judge who upheld the Speaker’s decision on Thursday, said that the petitioners had persisted with their stand though the governor had made it clear to them the whole thing was an internal matter of their party. He said: “This court finds that there were materials available on record and the speaker has taken cognizance of the same and on appreciation has reached a conclusion.” The question of what constitutes a legislator “voluntarily” giving up his membership of the party on whose ticket he had been elected hasn’t been an easy one for courts to answer. There are other sundry technicalities under which defectors try to take cover to escape disqualification. And then, there is always the scope to accuse the Speaker of bias and mala fide intentions — not a difficult proposition considering the utter degeneration of the institution of Speaker. And in the meantime, defections go on, unless defectors undergo a dramatic change of heart and decide not to be defectors — a tall order — or voters decide to shun turncoats, an easier thing to do.",2018-10-27,"AIADMK,Chennai,ConnectTheDots,Disqualified MLAs,E Palaniswami,India,Madras High Court,Politics,Supreme Court,Tamil Nadu",18 disqualified AIADMK MLAs pin hopes on technicalities and legal loopholes as they move SC to overturn verdict,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/18-disqualified-aiadmk-mlas-pin-hopes-on-technicalities-and-legal-loopholes-as-they-move-sc-to-overturn-verdict-5457701.html,firstpost,-1,0
fwire," In one of his sharpest attacks yet on Narendra Modi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh said his successor's rule has not been good for India as he ""failed"" the electorate and led a government that was ""mostly silent"" on incidents of communal violence, mob lynching and cow vigilantism.

In a scathing criticism of Modi, Singh said he was elected as the 14th prime minister of India on the back of many lofty promises, but in the past four years, he and his government ""failed"" their electorate and eroded the voters' faith.

Singh also alleged that Modi presides over a ""fearful population, an economy that has been set back by foolhardy initiatives, painful lack of jobs, the growing distress among India's farming communities, a devastating number of farmer suicides, insecure borders, instability in Kashmir, and the palpable failure in implementation of even laudable initiatives like Swachch Bharat, Skill Development, Make in India and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao"".

In September 2017, Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P Dhanapal disqualified 18 AIADMK MLAs under the 1986 Tamil Nadu Assembly Members Party Defection Law triggering a political crisis in the state after they announced their support for rebel AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran.

In her 200-page order, the chief justice had upheld the Speaker's decision, saying, ""In my opinion, the view taken by the Speaker is a possible, if not plausible view, and I am unable to hold that the said decision is any way unreasonable, irrational or perverse."" Justice Sundar, in his 135-page order, had disagreed, insisting that Dhanapal's order ""deserved to be set aside on grounds of perversity, non-compliance with principles of natural justice, mala fides and violation of the constitutional mandate"". Following the split verdict, Justice S Vimala was appointed to hear the petitions afresh. However, the disqualified MLAs moved the SC raising apprehension of ""bias"" and sought to transfer the matter to the apex court. The SC had then named Justice Sathyanarayanan, while declining to accept a prayer of the disqualified MLAs to move the case to the SC. Sathyanarayanan had reserved his orders on 31 August, after 12 days of a meticulous hearing. The case was listed for judgment late on Wednesday night.

Press Trust of India," Former Goa unit Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  (RSS) chief Subhash Velingkar has alleged that the BJP high command is pressuring Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to continue in the post despite his ill health, to retain power in the state. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, rubbished his charge, saying Parrikar was not being forced to continue as the Chief Minister and that his health condition was improving. Velingkar demanded that the state government give an update on the Chief Minister's health. ""They (government) are fooling people. Parrikar needs proper rest. Unfortunately, the BJP high command in Delhi wants to retain power in Goa, that is why they are not allowing him to rest. They are power hungry,"" he alleged. He was talking to reporters on Wednesday evening after addressing a meeting of his supporters in Mandrem Assembly 
constituency, where a bypoll is due after Dayanand Sopte, who had won from there last year, resigned and joined the BJP. 
Velingkar was ousted from the post of the Goa RSS chief in 2016 after his critical comments against Parrikar. Later, he formed a political outfit called the Goa Suraksha Manch, which fought against the BJP in the state Assembly polls held last year. Velingkar said the state government should have appointed another person as the chief minister till Parrikar 
recovered from illness. ""I feel this government will be dissolved and the Goa Assembly elections would be held along with the Lok Sabha polls,"" he said. Velingkar said the BJP was ""no more a party of ideology"". ""The elected representatives don't have anything to do with the party's ideology. They have imported leaders from other parties. The loyal cadre is disturbed.

""His health condition is improving now and he will resume office in November,"" he said.

FP Staff,"The Madras High Court on Thursday upheld the Speaker's decision to disqualify the 18 rebel AIADMK MLAs.    told the media that he was expecting a   decision but now the final decision will be taken after consultations with the 18   and the future course of action will be decided soon. Meanwhile, the AIADMK official handle tweeted that the Madras HC verdict has taught the correct lesson to its traitors and that democracy has won. The rebel ministers, supporting the Sasikala-Dhinakaran faction, were disqualified by P Dhanapal, the Speaker of the House, under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution (known as the anti-defection law) after they expressed lack of confidence in chief minister E Palaniswami. The ministers later moved a petition in the High Court challenging the Speaker’s decision following which the court restrained the Election Commission from declaring their seats vacant. Justice M Sathyanarayanan is set to deliver the verdict at 10.30am on Thursday. The case was listed for judgment late on Wednesday night. Justice Sathyanarayanan was named the third judge by the Supreme Court, after the then first bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar had delivered a split verdict on 14 June. He had reserved his orders on 31 August, after 12 days of a meticulous hearing. The verdict is being watched closely in political circles in the state since it has the potential to decide the future course of Tamil Nadu politics. If the verdict upholds the disqualification, by-elections will be held on all the seats that would be vacant and it would be a litmus test for the AIADMK government, whose popularity has been on the decline since the demise of its former leader J Jayalalithaa, as evidenced by the result of the RK Nagar bypoll in 2017. However, if the Speaker’s decision to disqualify the MLAs is reversed, the EPS government would plunge into a minority and it would have to face a floor test in the Assembly. In fact, recently four more MLAs who contested on the AIADMK ticket have also pledged their support to TTV Dhinakaran. One of them, Karunas, had sent a notice to the secretary of the Tamil Nadu State Legislative Assembly, seeking the removal of Speaker P Dhanapal. Meanwhile, AMMK chief Dhinakaran has instructed all but one of the 18 disqualified MLAs in his camp to move to a resort near the Tirunelveli district. According to a   report, all the rebel MLAs barring P Vetrivel are likely to remain holed up at a resort in Courtallam until the verdict comes out. The decision to shift the disqualified legislators came just hours after Dhinakaran met Sasikala at Bengaluru prison amid reports that the E Palanisami and O Panneerselvam government is trying to poach the MLAs loyal to Dhinakaran.",2018-10-25,"AIADMK,AIADMK MLAs,AMMK,Anti-Defection Law,E Palaniswami,Election Commission,Justice M Sathyanarayanan,Madras HC,Madras High Court,NewsTracker,O Panneerselvam,P Dhanapal,Sasikala,Tamil Nadu,Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly,TTV DInakaran","AIADMK MLAs' disqualification LATEST updates: MK Stalin says 'democracy must be safeguarded', expects by-elections soon",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/aiadmk-mlas-disqualification-live-updates-mk-stalin-says-democracy-must-be-safeguarded-expects-by-elections-soon-5442211.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"In a huge relief to the AIADMK government,   of the then chief justice Indira Banerjee which disqualified its 18 rebel MLAs under the anti-defection law for having sided with expelled leader and AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran. The 18 AIADMK MLAs were disqualified on 18 September 2017 after they met the governor and expressed loss of confidence in chief minister E Palaniswami. The Assembly Speaker P Dhanapal had then ordered their disqualification. An adverse judgement on Thursday could have triggered a political realignment in Tamil Nadu and brought the ruling party perilously close to losing the majority in the state assembly whose effective strength is 232 and two seats are vacant. However post the favourable verdict, senior AIADMK ministers celebrated the HC verdict along with chief minister and the deputy chief minister. Meanwhile, Palaniswami has said that if the Election Commission decides to conduct by-elections in these seats based on the court's verdict, AIADMK will contest and win in all of them. A division bench of the court comprising Banerjee and Justice M Sundar had delivered a split verdict on 14 June. Banerjee had upheld Speaker P Dhanapal's order disqualifying them, while Sundar had passed a dissenting judgement. The Supreme Court had then appointed Justice M Sathyanarayanan to hear the matter. Justice Sathyanarayanan Thursday said there was no infirmity in Dhanapal's order which was upheld by Banerjee. ""All the material that was available at the time of the passing of the order by the Speaker alone have been taken into consideration and this court cannot go into the subsequent events,"" the judge observed, upholding the disqualification. The judge said he had delivered his ""independent view"" on the matter and not gone by those expressed by the two judges who heard it earlier. In her 200-page 14 June order, Banerjee had upheld Dhanapal's decision, saying: ""In my opinion, the view taken by the Speaker is a possible, if not plausible view, and I am unable to hold that the said decision is any way unreasonable, irrational or perverse."" Justice Sundar, in his 135-page judgement, delivered separately, struck a dissenting note, insisting that Dhanapal's order ""deserved to be set aside on grounds of perversity, non -compliance with principles of natural justice, mala fides and violation of the constitutional mandate"". Banerjee had said the petitioners were given chance to present their case but they chose not to appear before the Speaker, and as such, they cannot complain of the breach of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) rule. Justice Banerjee said she also found ""substance"" in the contention of the government that if the effect of withdrawal of support and calling for the initiation of the constitutional process (against the chief minister) meant fall of the government, it would imply the relinquishment of membership of the party, and attract provisions of the disqualification law. Justice Sundar, however, said the entire controversy could have been put to rest had the Speaker conceded the plea of the petitioners to allow them an opportunity for cross-examination and give oral evidence. He had said that the Speaker's order, even if legally correct, deserved to be set aside for mala fides (in bad faith). Thursday's verdict came as a massive relief for the Palaniswami government as the restoration of the membership of the rebel MLAs could have set off a realignment in the state's politics with the Dhinakaran camp likely joining hands with the opposition DMK and bringing it dangerously close to losing the majority. The DMK and its allies the Congress and IUML together have 97 MLAs, and with the 18 rebel AIADMK forging an alliance with them besides independent legislator Dhinakaran himself, their strength would have risen to 116, which is equal to that of the ruling party. Two assembly seats are vacant, including Thiruvarur, which was represented by DMK patriarch the late M Karunanidhi. Reacting to the verdict, Dhinakaran, who now heads the AMMK after being sidelined in the AIADMK, said he would consult the MLAs loyal to him before deciding whether to go in appeal in the Supreme Court. ""We expected a favourable verdict but it is not a setback. I will consult the 18 MLAs on whether to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. Personally, my feeling is we should go for byelections,"" he said. Dhinakaran asserted his loyalists will sweep the bypolls. ""The court's judgement is different and people's judgement is different,"" he said, claiming his party and those loyal to it will emerge stronger after the verdict. Ther AIADMK hailed the judgement, calling it a ""just order"". Party spokesperson P Valarmathi expressed joy over the verdict and said the Palaniswami government has now proved that it is ""stable"". ""We are very happy...this is a just order,"" Valarmathi told  . The 18 MLAs, who are supporting the TTV-Sasikala faction, are currently holed up in a resort in Kutralam and Dhinakaran is expected to meet them on Thursday to decide if they will appeal the decision, sources said. Presently, there are around 16 MLAs at the Esakki High View Resort owned by AIADMK MLA Esakki Subbaiah. Meanwhile, Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan has said that the court's decision is not particularly surprising. ""This verdict should have come much earlier. Still, we hope that everyone will accept the court's decision. The MLAs currently at Kutralam are probably there to wash their sin off at the Pushkara festival,"" he said. Whereas DMK chief MK Stalin told reporters that the party did not have any expectations or worries about the verdict. He said the EC must immediately move to hold bye-elections in the 20 seats that are lying vacant now, including that of late DMK supremo M Karunanidhi. ""DMK is ready to face elections any time,"" he said. ""We have been discussing our strategies for the general elections and possible state elections as well."" However, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi chief Thol Thirumavalavan said that the High Court verdict is contradictory to democratic principles. Speaking with reporters at the VCK office in Chennai's Ashok Nagar, he expressed shock at the verdict and said it sets a wrong precedence. ""If TTV decides not to appeal, bye-elections must be held immediately, along with the general elections,"" he said as he expressed doubts that the EC is capable of conducting either election without making sure the candidates don't indulge in unethical and illegal campaign practices. Advocate Raja Senthoor Pandian, who has been fighting the case on behalf of the 18 disqualified MLAs, also expressed disappointment at the High Court's decision. He said it was believed that Justice Sathyanarayanan would take into consideration the two previous judgments in this case where the verdict was split. The defenders were only asked to only present new arguments. However, today, while delivering the verdict, the judge said that his decision is independent of the previous proceedings. If we had known this earlier, we would have presented our arguments differently, Pandian said. Pandian also said that there are now three options before them: To challenge the verdict before the Supreme Court; to face by-elections; or face by-elections while moving the SC.

Singh also said the Congress party, under the leadership of Rahul, will return to power in 2019 as the people are ""completely disillusioned"" with the BJP and want a ""positive change"". Singh, who is in Israel on a five-day visit, said India needed a young and dynamic leader to bring it out of the current mess and put it back on the global map. ""Rahul has all the qualities needed to be a great prime minister and he is the perfect man to lead the country, as I have always maintained,"" Singh told   in an interview when asked if he really feels Rahul is the right man for the job of running the country.

Debobrat Ghose,"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Sudhindra Bhadoria, in an interview to  , said that Mayawati is a credible Dalit face for the office of prime minister. He also said that Congress president Rahul Gandhi has to wait because he is yet to prove his mettle as a leader. Bhadoria, the sole authorised spokesperson of the party, expressed confidence that the grand alliance will project the BSP supremo as its prime ministerial candidate ahead of the 2019 election. Excerpts: Yes, Mayawati ji has all the qualities to be the prime ministerial face in 2019. She is the foremost leader and the most credible face of the Dalits, OBCs and the poor in the country. For three-and-a-half decades, she has been at the forefront of the movement for the empowerment of this section. She has a proven track record as an efficient administrator, who handled the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh with an iron fist. She has been Uttar Pradesh's chief minister for four terms and a member of Rajya Sabha. During her tenure, the state had registered a growth rate of 9 percent, as compared to 3.5 percent earlier. Apart from  , Om Prakash Chautala and HD Kumaraswamy have also pitched for her as the prime ministerial face in 2019. It won’t be a unilateral decision, as all the Opposition parties will join hands to make her the prime ministerial candidate. India has got prime ministers from every community. It is the Dalit community that has faced oppression and neglect for decades. For instance, Babu Jagjivan Ram, despite being a tall leader in the Congress, was denied the opportunity of being the prime minister. So, why not a prime minister from this community? This time, the Opposition parties should show magnanimity by providing this opportunity to the ‘ ’ Mayawati ji. The 2019 election will be a test for Narendra Modi and the BJP, on whether they could fulfill the promises they made to the electorate in 2014. People will find that they have been cheated on almost all fronts — including promises to provide 10 crore jobs in five years, depositing Rs 15 lakh in each bank account, as also the failure on the domestic and foreign policy fronts, and the BJP’s divisive agenda that has hurt our social fabric. Demonetisation and rising fuel prices have had a cascading effect on our economy and employment generation. The credibility of institutions like the CBI has been undermined. Our constitutional and democratic system is under threat. All these issues will bring non-BJP Opposition parties, including regional parties together. People will vote for the best alternative. Mayawati ji, even without having made any announcement about the formation of any coalition, has already stitched alliances in states. Time will tell how things shape up in 2019. The prime minister of a nation has a huge responsibility. From Jawaharlal Nehru to Modi, all those who have been elected to the post of prime minister have shown administrative capabilities and rich political experience. Neither does Rahul Gandhi have any administrative experience, nor has he delivered anything till date. Even within the Congress party, senior leaders like P Chidambaram and Salman Khurshid have admitted that Rahul is not the party’s prime ministerial face. He needs to wait and prove his mettle, till  the Congress gains strength of its own to form the government. The 2019 election will pose a big challenge to all parties, and they will need a credible face for the post of prime minister. Dynasty alone will not help a person become the prime minister. BSP is the third largest party in terms of vote share and has a presence in 50 percent of the states in the country. Any political party that wants to enter into an alliance needs to recognise the rising Dalit and OBC consciousness in the country. A respectable political space has to be provided to the BSP. See, the Congress must give space to other parties. While entering into an alliance, they should rise above their old feudal mindset. If they are thinking about their own space, they need to do so for others as well. Take the case of the Uttar Pradesh election, in which the Congress contested in 100 seats without having the strength to do so. What was the outcome? Even in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections this year — which are the constituencies of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya — the BSP-SP alliance won, and not the BJP or Congress. The BSP has been working on its strength and core constituency. We have one MLA in Chhattisgarh and four in Madhya Pradesh respectively, with a good vote share. In Madhya Pradesh, we are trying to bring smaller regional parties like the Gondwana Gantantra Party under a third-front umbrella. Wherever we enter into an alliance, we will replicate the model we had in Karnataka and Haryana. In Chhattisgarh, we have successfully got into an alliance with  . Alliances for 2019 will be forged in a smooth manner. We will cross the bridge when we come to it. The population in Chhattisgarh is dominated by SCs, STs and OBCs. Ajit Jogi has a strong influence among the adivasis. This led to the BSP-Janata Congress Chhattisgarh alliance. Mayawati ji has already announced that Jogi will be the chief ministerial face, as he has a strong recall value. The Congress anyway does not have any strong face to project as chief ministerial candidate. The present chief minister Raman Singh has been facing strong anti-incumbency. We stand a good chance to sail through and form the government. Besides the BSP’s own strength, secular and democratic forces will support Mayawati ji in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",2018-10-25,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Bahujan Samaj Party,BJP,BSP,Congress,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,Rahul Gandhi,Sudhindra Bhadoria,TheySaidIt","Mayawati can be Opposition's PM candidate, Rahul Gandhi yet to prove his mettle: BSP spokesperson Sudhindra Bhadoria",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mayawati-can-be-oppositions-pm-candidate-rahul-gandhi-yet-to-prove-his-mettle-bsp-spokesperson-sudhindra-bhadoria-5447711.html,firstpost,-1,0

FP Staff,"The internal feud in the country's premier investigative agency Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continued for the second day, as four alleged members of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) were nabbed outside the residence of Alok Verma, the CBI director who was divested of his authority and sent on leave on Wednesday. The central government has been   with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and leaders like MK Stalin calling the developments of the controversy an ""administrative anarchy"". Thursday's events of the   Verma's residence were followed by the government's order of sending Verma and the agency's Special Director Rakesh Asthana, who have been at loggerheads since the controversy began, on leave on Wednesday. Leading the attack against the government on the issue, Congress president Rahul Gandhi alleged that Verma was forcibly sent on leave as he was collecting documents relating to the Rafale ""scam"" and the country and its Constitution were in danger under the ruling dispensation. In a series of tweets, Gandhi also said, ""The prime minister's message is very clear that whoever comes near Rafale (issue) will be removed, wiped out."" The alleged scam in the purchase of the French-made fighter aircraft has been making headlines for a few months after the Congress levelled   of corruption against Modi. The BJP responded to Rahul's allegations, terming them ""rubbish"".   said, ""I regard this charge as rubbish. The fact that Opposition parties are saying we know what agency was going to do next itself casts a doubt on the fairness process. I don't believe what they are saying is true, but if they did have access to what was going on in the mind of a person, that itself demolishes the integrity of the person they are trying to support."" On Wednesday,   joined the Opposition in slamming the Centre for the rumblings in the CBI, saying they have come at a time when the agency was likely to take up cases like the controversial Rafale deal. Sending Verma on leave amidst his spat with Asthana was not just ""autocratic"", but also showed the BJP government's ""administrative anarchy,"" Stalin claimed in a statement. The leader of Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly said the action against Verma comes at a time when he had reportedly initiated a probe into the Rafale deal. ""Reports suggest he had ordered a preliminary inquiry into the Rafale deal. The prime minister, who was angered by this, has used the opportunity to appoint IG level official Rao as director and this is a misuse of authority,"" Stalin said. He said there was a public perception that the Centre's actions were seen more to ""conceal"" the Rafale issue rather than protecting Asthana. Verma was always opposed to the ""forceful imposition of Asthana into the CBI by Prime Minister Modi,"" he said, and condemned the action against Verma. The actions of the prime minister created an impression of an ""undeclared emergency,"" he added. The CBI was presently handling sensitive cases and therefore required a director with ""impeccable integrity"", he said. ""But by appointing a junior officer, the BJP government has made the CBI its caged parrot,"" he said. Stalin alleged that the central agency may be used against the Opposition during elections. ""It is unacceptable to see a war being declared against CBI's independence, credibility and autonomy,"" he said and called for revoking of the action against Verma.  retweeted Modi's 2013 tweet in which he had slammed the then UPA government for allegedly ""undermining the intelligence system"" of the country. Kejriwal retweeted Modi's 5 June, 2013 tweet in which he had said that it was ""unfortunate that in its quest to target political opponents, Centre (UPA government) is undermining intelligence systems with CBI questioning IB officials."" ""What are the reasons for sending CBI director on leave? Under which law did the Modi govt get the authority to initiate action against the chief of an investigating agency appointed as per the Lokpal Act? What is the Modi govt trying to hide?"" he said. Later, addressing a gathering at an event in Delhi, Kejriwal alleged, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has suspended the CBI director at 3 am. Do you know this? Why? I tell you that the Modi government is buying one Rafale fighter jet with a cost of Rs 1,500 crore instead of its original cost of Rs 546 crore. They are doing a scam of Rs 36,000 crore in buying 36 Refale jets. ""When the CBI director (Alok Verma), who is an honest person, started investigation in the case, he was suddenly transferred at 3 am,"" Kejriwal said.  is slated to hold protests on Friday outside all CBI offices across the country, demanding an apology from Modi and the reinstatement of Verma as CBI director.

After slamming the Centre on the issue on Twitter on Wednesday, Rahul also addressed the issue during his campaign in Rajasthan. He accused the prime minister of not consulting with a mandatory three-member committee required for such decisions, instead took the decision on his own. He also reiterated his ""chowkidar"" charge, saying that the prime minister was scared that the country would know that the ""chowkidar"" had stolen Rs 30,000 crore. Congress's chief spokesperson   said the prime minister's ""desperate bid"" to cover up the Rafale ""scam"" had pushed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into complete ""disintegration"". He also hit out at Jaitley and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for putting out a ""weak defence of cleaning the system to justify the prime minister's panic reaction on the Rafale scam"".

""What is happening in the CBI is like a coup that has shocked the entire nation. The CBI has been plunged into such a crisis. Its credibility stands completely destroyed. It is happening under the nose of the prime minister. ""There is speculation that it has something to do with the Rafale scam. People want to know the truth. The prime minister being the head of the government should explain to the people and the nation,"" Raja said. In a statement, the party alleged that the PMO was acting like an all-powerful 'extra-constitutional body'.  said that the way the government had conducted the matter was ""constitutionally, morally and politically wrong and illegal"". He said in a statement that the decision to transfer Verma was in violation of rules laid down by the Supreme Court that only a selection commission, comprising the prime minister, the chief justice of India and the leader of the largest opposition party can decide on suspending or removing the CBI chief.

At least five of the 40 Assembly constituencies in Mizoram share borders with Tripura, which has a 109 km border with the Christian-dominated state. BJP president Amit Shah, who kicked-off the election campaign in Mizoram last week, announced the party would field candidates in all the 40 Assembly seats of the state. BJP leaders in Mizoram have been asserting that they would make all-out efforts to remove the Congress from power in the state to ""paint the northeast with the saffron colour"". Mizoram is the only state ruled by the Congress in the region. The BJP is making intensive efforts to win the Christian-dominated state, after having formed governments on its own or by forming alliances in the remaining six northeastern states, excluding Sikkim. Meanwhile, the ruling Congress suffered a major setback after state Home Minister and senior party leader R Lalzirliana and three sitting legislators, Lalrinliana Sailo, Buddha Dhan Chakma, both former ministers, and Hmingdailova Khiangte resigned from the party.

FP Staff,"Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of trying to make Sabarimala a place of violence for gaining political mileage out of it. He said that any such bid by the Sangh Parivar would be defeated and the interests of the devotees wold be protected. ""Nobody should think that Sabarimala can be converted into a place of violence. Criminals will not be allowed to concentrate at the shrine. If some criminals think so, they will be thrown out from there and the devotees shall be protected,"" Vijayan told media persons in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. Condemning the protests against the women devotees between the age of 10 and 50 in the past one week when they tried to go to Sabarimala, Vijayan said that the women were turned away by protestors when they had reached for darshan even after the Supreme Court order. He said that the state government cannot ignore the Suprme Court order allowing entry of women of all age groups, and it is committed to implement the court order. ""Any woman devotee who wishes to go to Sabarimala will be given protection in the background of the SC order. It's a govt which functions under the Constitution and it is bound to implement the SC order,"" he said. The chief minister alleged that Sangh Parivar was trying to divide the people of Kerala on communal lines and it even tried to communalise even the  , which has been doing a commendable job for the devotees at Sabarimala for decades together. He alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party's state president PS Sreedharan Pillai called upon the devotees in the police force to ""think over the issue"" and thus tried to create a mutiny in the force. The chief minister said that police have no religion or caste and any efforts to destroy the force's basic nature should be thwarted. He also ruled out any intelligence failure in Sabarimala and said that the police had succeeded in maintaining law and order at the shrine despite all protests. Ruling out the Pandalam royal family's claims over the shrine, Vijayan has made it clear that Sabarimala temple is the property of Devaswom Board and other claims have no basis. He also flayed the stand of the temple priests, or the tantris, who staged a protest and threatened to close the temple   under heavy police protection reached very close to the temple for the first time after the Supreme Court order. The chief minister alleged that the priests tried to defeat the SC order and said that this stand could not be accepted. He reiterated that Devaswom Board is the sole authority to decide about closing and opening of Sabarimala temple, not the trantris. ""Their primary duty is to allow devotees for a smooth darshan, not to prevent them,"" he said. Ruling out the allegations that the government was utilising temples' revenue, the chief minister said that government spent Rs 302.18 crore for making arrangements at Sabarimala for devotees last year. He also said that the Devaswom Board would take appropriate measures against its officials if they tried to stop women officials from entering Sabarimala as part of their duty. Taking note of the protests by the devotees against the SC order, the chief minister said that initially people would not accept a change and it happened in the past also. Citing the example of the Guruvayoor satyagraha of 1932, he said that the movement seeking entry for the people belonging to SC/ST and other lower castes faced massive protests from conservatives. He also noted that non-believers were leading the Guruvayoor satyagraha. Vijayan alleged that BJP and Congress were trying to gain political mileage out of Sabarimala row. AICC and BJP supported the SC order initially and even termed it a historic verdict. Later they made a u-turn from their early stand and tried to create rioting in the holy shrine, he added. Carrying out a scathing attack on Congress, he said some Congressmen tried to join Sangh Parivar in the Sabarimala agitation and it was not fair. The chief minister pointed out that so many people filed review petition and Congress and BJP are yet to join them. ""We are committed to preserve and protect our secular nature of the state. Sangh Parivar is trying to destroy it. It tries to bring back conservative thinking. Congress tries to destroy itself by joining Sangh,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,": Punjab minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa Monday defended Navjot Kaur Sidhu over the Amritsar train tragedy, saying she was not at fault, and blamed the railway gateman for the incident, in which nearly 60 people were killed Friday. Navjot Kaur Sidhu, the wife of cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, was the chief guest at a Dussehra function in Amritsar on Friday, when a train mowed down several people watching the event. Bajwa rubbished the Shiromani Akali Dal's (SAD) demand of removing state minister Navjot Singh Sidhu from the cabinet over the incident. The couple has been a target of the Akalis ever since the train accident occurred. The SAD had sought registration of a murder case against Navjot Kaur Sidhu as well as the organisers of the Dussehra function, while holding them responsible for abetting the tragic incident. It had also demanded Navjot Singh Sidhu's dismissal from the cabinet. ""What is the fault of Navjot Kaur Sidhu…what difference would have been made, had she reached the venue 10 minutes late,"" Bajwa said, replying to a reporter's question in Chandigarh. ""In fact, the culprit is the railway gateman at the nearby railway barrier,"" he alleged. ""A large number of people were standing on the railway track, which was only 300 metres from the railway barrier. Was he not aware about it? It is the responsibility of the gateman not to give green signal to a train when people are standing on the track. When we stage a sit-in on the railway track, the movement of trains is halted,"" the minister said. Claiming that the gateman had closed the railway barrier, he said, ""Why did he give clearance when he knew that people were standing on the track for at least two hours? He could very well see them."" Bajwa also said it was important to find out why the train was not stopped. Dismissing the Akali Dal's demand to remove Navjot Singh Sidhu from the cabinet, the state urban development minister said, ""A lot of people are demanding the resignation of Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal as well."" H also said the venue where the Dussehra celebrations were held could not accommodate a large number of people. ""But what can be done, it has been happening for 40 years,"" Bajwa added. Navjot Singh Sidhu had targeted the Indian Railways over the tragic incident Sunday, raising several questions about the national transporter's functioning, and asked how a ""clean chit"" was given to the loco-pilot of the train, which killed nearly 60 people in ""one day"".

KN Kishore," All calculations of three-time winner Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and efforts of the Opposition Congress to win the upcoming Chhattisgarh polls may come to nought if the uncanny political alliance between the newly constituted Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) clicks with the state electorate. Chhattisgarh — long considered a fort of the Congress, even in undivided Madhya Pradesh when the party used to win the maximum seats from the region — was created in 2000 and got its first chief minister in Ajit Pramod Kumar Jogi, a bureaucrat-turned-politician then part of the Congress. Three years of his tenure saw plenty of ups and downs and a turn towards caste politics. As a result, in the 2003 Assembly polls, a public in turmoil brought the BJP to power, and the saffron party has been  . Two years ago, Jogi and his son Amit broke away from the Congress over allegations of anti-party activities, and Jogi was quick to form the JCC, a regional outfit with a national outlook. Today, he is a liability to both the BJP and Congress, though both refuse to admit it. For this election, the JCC and BSP have decided to go for a 55:35 seat-sharing ratio, with JCC getting the chunk of seats and  . Their alliance is expected to capitalise on 15 seats — a number large enough to alter the course of government formation in Chhattisgarh. Jogi also recently announced withdrawal from the election fray, saying he would fully concentrate on the alliance’s election campaign in 90 seats, after challenging Chief Minister Raman Singh to an open contest in his home turf of Rajnandgaon. However, by Monday, there were speculations that Jogi may take a U-turn on his earlier stand, after people from his traditional stronghold of Marwahi constituency approached him and requested his nomination. Going by the 2013 election math, the BSP has a considerable presence in 11 Assembly constituencies, with its vote share ranging from 1 percent to 30 percent in these seats. Currently, the party’s lone MLA is Keshav Chandra, who has been retained as a candidate from Jaijaipur. In 2003, the BSP had won two seats in the Assembly — Kamda Jhole from Sarangarh (Scheduled Caste) and Lalsay Khunte from Malkharoda (SC) — and in 2008, it had bagged the two seats of Akaltara and Pamgarh under Saurabh Singh and Dujram Bouddh. The BJP had won 50 seats that year, while the Congress held 38. In 2013, Saurabh quit the BSP and joined the Congress. Jhole was expelled from the BSP for anti-party activities. Traditionally speaking, Jogi’s supporters have been seen gravitating towards the BJP, but with the JCC in action, all such votes are expected to shift back to his party, hitting at the BJP and Congress vote-bank — both parties had a vote difference of just below 1 percent in the last elections. Jogi’s family itself has considerable influence in the Marwahi and Kota constituencies of Chhattisgarh. On Congress tickets, Jogi’s son Amit had won from Marwahi, while Jogi’s wife Renu had emerged victorious in Kota. Amit is now with Jogi’s JCC, but Renu has expressed her wish to go for a Congress ticket again. Two sitting Congress MLAs, Siyaram Kaushik from Bilha and RK Rai from Gunderdehi constituencies, are with Jogi now, but his daughter-in-law Richa Jogi is in the fray from Akaltara on a BSP ticket. JCC’s former candidate from Chandrapur, Gitanjali Patel, also joined the BSP a few days ago and has been retained on the party ticket. On Sunday, Jogi announced a pre-poll alliance with the CPI for the Chhattisgarh elections, with the Left party getting two seats to contest in South Bastar — Dantewada and Konta — where it already has considerable influence. CPI’s Manish Kunjam, a former MLA, will fight against Deputy Leader of Opposition and Congress’ sitting MLA Kawasi Lakhma from Konta. CR Bakshi, central control commission secretary of the CPI, said the party would field candidates on other seats, too, such as Jagdalpur, Kondagaon and Keshkal, and the alliance will support them.   for these seats, as well as for Dantewada. The Janjgir-Champa district is also being considered for the polls. Likely to join the JCC-BSP-CPI coalition is the Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha, whose president Janak Lal Thakur confirmed that they had held talks with CPI leaders. He hopes a final decision on the alliance will be made soon. BSP supremo Mayawati plans to hold around  , with two on 4 November in  , in which CPI’s star campaigner T Raja will also participate. Jogi has expressed hope that people will develop a sense of belonging with the alliance, headed by the regional JCC. Jogi’s father has a following among Dalits, Muslims and Christians and, he said, the three parties are cadre-based, having a direct link with the poor and downtrodden, as well as an understanding of local aspirations. In his manifesto, Jogi has already submitted an affidavit, listing the 12 things he would do if he comes to power. He pointed out that no other political party has clarity on promises to voters as they have to look towards New Delhi for decision-making, whereas his JCC has no such compulsions. BJP state general secretary Santosh Pandey admitted that the JCC-BSP-CPI alliance has an influence in around 11-12 SC-dominated seats, mainly in the Janjgir-Champa region and the Left-favoured three seats in the Bastar region, including Bilaspur. “The alliance will be concentrating on these winnable seats. But it would not have much impact on the BJP,” Pandey insisted. Another entrant in the Chhattisgarh political arena with much fanfare is the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which claims to be a favourable alternative to both the BJP and Congress. Its state in-charge, Gopal Rai, has already termed the JCC-BSP-CPI alliance a sinking boat. Clearly, AAP is expecting to repeat its New Delhi performance in Chhattisgarh, but going by the party's performance in the Karnataka Assembly polls, even opening their account in Chhattisgarh will be an achievement.",2018-10-23,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha,Chhattisgarh Polls,Congress,CPI,Janata Congress Chhattisgarh,JCC,JCC Alliance,Mayawati,PoliticsDecoder,Raman Singh","Chhattisgarh Assembly polls: Ajit Jogi's JCC liability for both Congress, BJP; ex-Congress man playing cards right with BSP, CPI as allies",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chhattisgarh-assembly-polls-ajit-jogis-jcc-liability-for-both-congress-bjp-ex-congress-man-playing-cards-right-with-bsp-cpi-as-allies-5429171.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Maharashtra finance minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar on Tuesday expressed confidence that his party and the Shiv Sena would stay united in future polls, against the backdrop of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's stand to go solo. Speaking at the ""Mumbai Manthan"" conclave organised by news channel  , the minister sought to downplay the criticism of the BJP government by the Sena, a constituent of the Central and Maharashtra governments and the oldest member of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance).

Mungantiwar further said that both the parties are together now and will remain so in future as well. ""I am confident that we will remain together in the upcoming elections. However, instead of criticism, there should be better work done,"" he said. He further said the Opposition is not ready to introspect that they lost the elections because of their ""attitude"". ""Instead, they are wasting their time by blaming EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) and alleging that the BJP had spent money (to win polls),"" he said. Sena MP Arvind Sawant said when his party criticises the BJP, it is not out of enmity. ""We view the criticism as our duty to bring an erring friend back on the right track,"" he said. He credited Sena for the farm loan waiver announced by the BJP-led state government last year. Sawant reiterated that his party would come to power on its own in the state in the assembly polls, due next October. Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan said while the Sena agrees to the decisions taken in the Cabinet, the party criticises them outside. ""There are so, so many failures of this government — from mob lynching to suicides by farmers. People will decide their fate,"" he said. Chavan claimed the election machinery, including returning officers, are under immense pressure so much so that they can't work independently. ""Why can't the EC switch to paper ballots even after a written demand was raised by the entire Opposition?"" the former chief minister asked. Mungantiwar said the EVMs were introduced by the Congress which is now criticising them. ""We are ready for ballot papers for elections,"" he said. Chavan said all the secular and like-minded parties, including the CPI, CPM, SP, BSP, should come together. Senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said BJP and Sena had made many promises in the run-up to 2014 elections but later accepted that they were nothing but poll ' ' (gimmick). ""The Sena criticises BJP everyday in its newspaper edits. The manner in which the BJP is attacked, they should be praised for tolerating Sena. Either you are in government or in the Opposition. You cannot be in both folds,"" he said. The Cabinet takes decision collectively. So if the BJP has erred, so is the Sena, he said. ""Uddhav  (Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray) wants to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya. While we extend our well wishes for that, but why a memorial for Balasaheb Thackeray has not been constructed till now?"" questioned Bhujbal, a former Shiv Sainik.

Press Trust of India,": Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar Tuesday said if the central government was ""effective"", there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI, and asked prime minister Narendra Modi to act over the matter. He also attacked the BJP-led Centre over the Rafale jet deal and demanded a probe into it by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC). Pawar was replying to queries during an interaction at the ""Mumbai Manthan"" conclave organised by television news channel Aaj Tak. The feud between Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Director Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana turned murkier with the arrest of a deputy superintendent of police in the Special Investigation Team headed by Asthana over bribery charges. Asked about the Modi government's performance, Pawar said people's expectations from the present dispensation were not fulfilled. ""What was promised in 2014 is not seen on the ground after four years. (Former prime minister) Manmohan Singh tried his best to give a good government, intentions were best. That is not the situation today. ""If the present government was effective, there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI. Still the prime minister is silent. He should act,"" the former Union minister said. Pawar said Modi was a strong leader for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but not the country. ""His ministerial team does not have the capacity to deliver. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is the most powerful. All decisions are taken there and the files are sent to the ministers to sign. The present government does only 'man ki baat' and does not listen to 'jan ki baat' (people's voice),"" he added. Firing a fresh salvo over the Rafale fighter jet deal, Pawar said the Centre should clarify why the price of one aircraft increased from Rs 570 crore to Rs 1,600 crore. ""There is room for suspicion. So there should be a JPC probe. If the BJP stalled Parliament for three weeks for a JPC probe in (the) Bofors (case), why should the BJP, now in power, oppose a JPC?,"" he asked. Asked if he felt there was corruption in the Rafale deal as alleged by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Pawar said he had no information about it. ""I only know the aircraft is good. Rahul Gandhi may have more information than me about corruption,"" he said. Led by the Congress, the opposition parties have been attacking the Modi government, alleging that it is procuring 36 Rafale jets from France at an exorbitantly high cost.

Press Trust of India," The CPM on Tuesday said the current developments in the country's premier investigative agency Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have seriously damaged the Indian republic and must be resisted. ""The polit bureau considers these developments as seriously damaging the Indian Republic and must be resisted tooth and nail,"" the Left party said in a statement. It said the recent happenings in the CBI show the degree of damage that is being caused by the present government at the Centre to Constitutional authorities and institutions of parliamentary democracy in India. ""The undermining of the parliament itself, interference in the judiciary, manipulation of institutions like the CBI are not due to poor 'governance' but due to malafide intentions to undermine the secular democratic foundations of the Indian Constitution,"" the CPM statement said.

Asian News International," After filing his nomination for the upcoming state assembly elections, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh expressed confidence that his government will come to power once again in the state for the fourth time. ""I am confident of forming a government once again in the state. There should not be a deficit of one single vote. We need to display our might once again to come back to power. Unlike Congress, who only deceived the poor and the farmers, we worked for the development of Chhattisgarh,"" Singh said while addressing a rally from his constituency in Rajnandgaon. Launching a scathing attack at the opposition Congress, Singh said, ""The Congress just took the people for a ride here in Chhattisgarh through their ""Garibi Hatao"" slogan. They did nothing for the poor here. The poor, these days, get rice at Rs 1 per kilogram, the women get gas cylinders for free.

Debobrat Ghose,"As the power tussle within the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) plays out in public, dragging the powerful Prime Minister's Office into controversy, the glee in the Congress camp is understandable. The fight involving the top two officials of the premier investigative agency — Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana — has come as godsend for a party looking to put Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a spot of bother ahead of the 2019 elections. This time, it gets to aim at him at a more personal level since one of the persons in the fracas has a strong Gujarat link. The party is also using the opportunity to bring the spotlight back on the Rafale deal. In a tweet on Wednesday, Congress president Rahul Gandhi alleged that CBI chief Verma has been sent on leave as he was involved in collecting evidence on the Rafale deal. The PMO, according to TV news reports, was unhappy with Verma after he entertained complaints on the deal from former minister Arun Shourie and lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan a couple of weeks ago. The issue has caused the government serious embarrassment since Asthana is a Gujarat-cadre IPS officer who is close to both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. He was elevated to the number two position in the agency and sources say he had a habit of throwing his weight around. With the infighting within the agency between Verma and Asthana, the credibility of CBI is seriously hurt. Enough mudslinging has taken place over a fortnight due to allegations and counter-allegations exchanged between the two officials, which has also brought out alleged cases of corruption against the bureau officials. Asthana has investigated several high-profile and sensitive cases – from Godhra train fire (2002) to fodder scam, in which RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav was arrested; from Vijay Mallya’s bank fraud case to AgustaWestland chopper scam case. In September, Asthana wrote to the government against his boss Verma, and his complaint was referred to Central Vigilance Commission. He accused Verma of trying to interfere with and thwart investigations in important cases. Congress, which has desperately been looking for issues to take Modi and his government to task, has lost no time in training guns at the government. Congress leader and in-charge, AICC Communication, Randeep Surjewala, on Tuesday said, “Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi is solely accountable and responsible for dismantling, denigrating and destroying India’s premier investigation agency CBI. Habitual and perpetual misuse of CBI by PM Modi and BJP president Amit Shah in fixing political opponents and illegal intervention of serious criminal cases has landed the CBI in an unfathomable mess, eroding its independence and credibility.”  
The Congress has alleged the government violated CBI laws, deliberately misused and controlled every institution, including the CBI, violated a Supreme Court ruling, and attempted to save Asthana. Meanwhile, Asthana has been stripped of all his responsibilities at CBI and a probe has been initiated against him. Nine CBI officials probing the Asthana case have been transferred. Reacting sharply to these transfers, Surjewala said that “illegality, interference and unconstitutionality of Modi government today has hit a new low”. 
However, this is not the first time that the CBI’s credibility and functioning have been questioned. Not long ago, former CBI director Ranjit Sinha famously agreed with the Supreme Court’s observation that the CBI was a 'caged parrot that speaks to its master's voice'. It now appears the parrot may have many masters, not all necessarily political ones, and it may have a mind of its own too. And yes, political control was always a good excuse to hide under. Though the ongoing CBI fiasco has taken an ugly political battle, it hardly matters for the voters, as they know well how a ruling government uses the CBI to counter its Opposition. There are innumerable examples in the past. During the previous UPA regime, it was the BJP, as the Opposition party, which had begun using the acronym of ‘Congress Bureau of Investigation’ for CBI, in reference to agency’s alleged tilt towards the party in power then. Come what may, the public will cast its vote as it wishes to, irrespective of the CBI scam. But the government, on the other hand, needs to fix the CBI issue with an iron hand to keep its promise made to the electorate of delivering a ‘corruption-free government’. As Modi had said, “  (Neither will I engage in corruption nor allow anyone to do it.)""",2018-10-24,"Alok Verma,BJP,CBI,Central Bureau Of Investigation,Congress,CriticalPoint,India,Politics,Prime Minister Narendra Modi,Rahul Gandhi,Rakesh Asthana",CBI vs CBI row gives Congress golden opportunity to take Narendra Modi government head on,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/cbi-vs-cbi-row-gives-congress-golden-opportunity-to-take-narendra-modi-government-head-on-5440111.html,firstpost,-1,0

Debobrat Ghose,"Ajit Singh Khangrot, a farmer and village Panchayat member from Sambhar in Jaipur, was visibly annoyed when asked why he had been raising anti-Modi (Narendra Modi) slogan at ‘ ’ farmers’ protest rally organised by the Congress farmers’ cell at Parliament Street in New Delhi on Tuesday. “If Prime Minister Narendra Modi thinks that the government at the Centre has been due to the BJP coming to power, then he’s wrong. It’s due to the lakhs of farmers, agricultural labourers and the common man who voted the BJP to power with a huge majority, because Modi promised ‘ ’ for the farmers. But, the prime minister has failed to keep his promises. And, if it continues, the same voters won’t hesitate to throw the BJP out from the Centre in 2019,” Khangrot told  . The farmers' agitation in the National Capital on Tuesday led by former BJP MP from Bhandara-Gondia and now chairman, All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor Congress, Nana Patole and the narrative weaved around it was a clear indication that the Congress has started wooing farmers aggressively ahead of the 2019 general elections. Besides highlighting the plight of farmers across the country, the Congress leaders and the farmers who came from various states also made it clear that the party led by its president Rahul Gandhi would make farmer distress a major issue during the Lok Sabha election. “Today it’s the beginning of our struggle. Modi didn’t keep the promises he made to farmers in 2014 – whether it was related implementation of Swaminathan Committee recommendations, minimum support price (MSP), waiving crop loans or bringing down the prices of fertilisers. We’ll ensure that the farmers get their dues. If Congress comes to power in 2019, it’ll fulfil all promises made to farmers. It’s their right and government won’t be doing any charity,” Patole said. After addressing the rally, Patole along with hundreds of Congress workers and farmers, broke the barricades and marched into the Parliament Street police station raising slogans, and staged a dharna. The farmers’ cell of the Congress and one of the frontal organisations of the party — All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor Congress managed to bring farmers from various states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal, to name just a few. Patole’s presence as a new leader of the farmers’ cell has enthused them to revive the organisation and fight for their rights. “Farmers are motivated by the fact that Nanaji (Patole), who’s a farmer himself and left BJP over the farmers’ issue, is heading Kisan Khet Mazdoor Congress and leading the agitation. Farmers’ issue is going to be big during 2019 Lok Sabha election,” said S Pawan Kumar, a farmer and state president of Tamil Nadu Kisan Khet Mazdoor Congress. During the rally,   spoke to farmers from several states to know more about the issues bothering the agriculture sector. Pawan Kumar who belongs to Tiruvallur district in Tamil Nadu alleged that lack of crop purchasing centres in the state have made it difficult for the farmers sell their produce at right price. “Farmers are unable to get the MSP of their produce, which is a major problem. They’re compelled to sell at a price much below the MSP. It’s more due to the collusion between touts (middlemen) and government officers. The government should announce Kaveri delta inland zone as an agriculture zone and mining of hydrocarbons and methane should be banned; otherwise farming will collapse in this area,” he mentioned. The farmers from this poll-bound state alleged that the BJP government in the state has failed to keep proper functioning of crop mandis. “Farmers are unable to sell their crops in mandis and as a result they have to undersell their produce to middlemen. BJP government made false promise to the farmers that their income would be doubled. In fact, after the Note ban, our conditions worsened. The issues bothering farmers are a part of Congress manifesto in the assembly polls and farmer distress would emerge as a major issue. Congress will come to power in Rajasthan this time,” Ajit Singh Khangrot said. The farmers from poll-bound Madhya Pradesh didn’t forget to remind the public, as well as, farmers from other states about the Mandsaur incident. In June 2017, Mandsaur district witnessed a massive outburst in the form of farmers' agitation and violence, which later spread to other districts. Six farmers were killed in police firing. “The condition of farmers in Madhya Pradesh is very bad. Gunvant Patidar, who’s associated with Naujawan Kisan Sabha and was instrumental in brokering peace deal between the farmers and government during Mandsaur farmers’ strike, quit BJP. This happened because Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is highly insensitive to farmer issues. One can see tractor full of produce of farmers waiting at mandis. Prices of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds continue to be high,” alleged Shankar Patidar. The agricultural labourers who participated along with farmers from Uttar Pradesh complained of not getting employment under MNREGA. “It has become difficult for us to get regular employment under MNREGA, and whatever wages we get against the work done are below the standard wage. We’re not getting any support from state government,” alleged Akhlaf Salmani from Muzaffarnagar. Despite having Congress government in Punjab and as coalition partner in Karnataka, the farmers and representatives of state farmers’ cell of the Congress from these two states were also present. “Captain Sahab’s (Amarinder Singh) government in Punjab has shown that Congress keeps its promises. The state government has waived electricity charges of farmers and crop loan. But the continuous hike in diesel prices has increased the input costs for farmers. We’re here to give moral support to farmers from other states,” said Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Amritsar. Added Mohd Zabiula, a Ragi farmer from Kolar in Karnataka, “Narendra Modi made false promises and did nothing for the farmers at the grass roots. Our state government is now waiving crop loans of farmers. If the UPA government could waive farm loan worth Rs 70,000 crore, why the NDA government failed to do so? The central government is more concerned about the capitalists rather than the farmers.” , Patole said that Congress would launch a mega rally of farmers led by Raul Gandhi in January 2019. During the rally, Patole and other Congress leaders including Randeep Singh Surjewala and Raj Babbar urged the farmers to continue with the agitation in respective states.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the JD(U) president, was expected to soon send Kishor, 41, to Rajya Sabha. Instead, Kishor said he would ""work on the strategy to ensure a strong JD(U) by attracting youth and students into its fold"" and put his entire time and energy into strengthening the party in Bihar and on the national level. Kishor's elevation by Nitish was viewed as a political masterstroke by the Bihar chief minister, who plans to put his best foot forward ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls ""In JD(U) and outside, Kishor is considered close to Nitish.

Press Trust of India,": AAP convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Sunday visited households in the New Delhi area to collect donations and ask for votes for his party in 2019 parliamentary polls. ""People were very happy with the work done by the Delhi government and they will give donations and votes to the AAP,"" he said.

The donation campaign - ""Aap Ka Daan, Rashtra Ka Nirman"" - was launched by Kejriwal last Monday. The campaign will go on for four months, with around 3,000 AAP workers going door-to-door in all the seven Parliamentary constituencies in Delhi.

Press Trust of India,": Congress President Rahul Gandhi will Monday kick off his party's campaign for Chhattisgarh Assembly elections by addressing a rally of farmers in Raipur. Farmers are being seen as a major vote bank in the state by the ruling BJP and Opposition Congress - the two dominant players in the state politics. ""The AICC Chief will arrive at the Swami Vivekanand airport at around 2.10 pm Monday. He is scheduled to address a rally of farmers from the Science College ground at around 3 pm,"" said state Congress spokesperson Sushil Anand Shukla on Sunday. ""Gandhi would hold meetings with senior party leaders during his brief visit.

Rajnandgaon. The remaining 72 constituencies will go to polls on 20 November. The Congress has so far announced 12 candidates for all the 12 seats of Bastar division, but is yet to announce the names of candidates for six more seats that fall in

Indo-Asian News Service," The Shiromani Akali Dal core committee on Sunday demanded immediate sacking of Punjab Local Bodies Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and registration of a murder case against his wife and former legislator Navjot Kaur Sidhu as well as organizers of Dussehra function on Friday. Holding Kaur and organisers of the Dusshera function responsible ""for abetting the Amritsar tragedy"", the core committee, which met in Chandigarh under the chairmanship of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, rejected the magisterial inquiry ordered by the Congress government. It demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court into the tragedy. Terming the ""man-made disaster as unparalleled on account of the criminal negligence and sheer abetment by the function organizers"", the core committee condemned the cover-up operation launched by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and demanded registration of a fresh case in the matter as per the statement of the victims' families. The core committee said: ""The Congress government is now muzzling the voice of the poor by instituting a tailor-made inquiry with the sole aim of giving a clean chit to the culprits and putting the blame squarely on the Indian Railways."" ""This is being done despite the fact that the victim families were ready to present irrefutable evidence against a Congress councilor as well as Mrs Navjot Kaur Sidhu for abetting the tragedy,"" it added. It also noted that evidence against the councilor and Kaur was present in the public domain and that this should be taken into account while proceeding against both of them. ""Keeping all these facts into account, there was no possibility of a free and fair inquiry by a magistrate who was reporting to cabinet minister Navjot Sidhu and his family,"" the committee stated. The core committee said it was condemnable that the Punjab government was refusing to take action against the Congress leaders despite available evidence of negligence. The committee also passed a resolution calling for Rs 1 crore compensation to each of the victim families as well as grant of government job to the next of kin of the victims. The meeting also served an ultimatum to the government to register a fresh case as per the statement of the victims and institute a judicial inquiry besides giving compensation as demanded failing which it would initiate an agitation to ensure justice to the tragedy victims.

TK Devasia,"The #MeToo campaign, which made headlines in many parts of the country, had not gained much traction in Kerala till now. However, the movement may gain strength in the state, with the police acting on revelations made by a ""tainted"" women entrepreneur four years ago. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front government, reeling under an unprecedented communal flare-up over the Supreme Court verdict on entry of women of all ages into the popular Sabarimala hill shrine, revived the case by constituting a new investigation team of the crime branch. The investigation team headed by Abdul Kareem, commandant of Malabar Special Police (MSP), has set the ball rolling by initiating criminal proceedings against senior Congress leader and former chief minister Oommen Chandy and party colleague and former union minister KC Venugopal on a complaint lodged by  , the prime accused in the alleged solar scam. In a first information report (FIR) filed on 20 October in the Thiruvananthapauram Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court, the crime branch said that the two had sexually abused the woman when she approached them for government support for the business she partnered with her estranged husband Biju Radhakrishnan. The FIR accused Chandy, who is currently AICC general secretary, of having unnatural sex with Sarita at Cliff House, the official residence of the chief minister, during a shut down strike in 2012. Venugopal, a member of Parliament and AICC general secretary, has been accused of having sex with her at multiple places, including the residence of former state minister KP Anil Kumar. Sarita had leveled sexual abuse allegations against a dozen Congress leaders, including two former union ministers and three former state ministers besides a few other MPs and MLAs in a letter she submitted to a judicial commission appointed by the then Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government to probe the solar scam. The scam, which involved more than 30 people alleging being cheated of Rs 6.5 crores by Sarita and Biju Radhakrishnan by offering solar solutions citing their political contacts, had come to light when one of the customers who had paid for installing solar panels filed a complaint against their company. The names of Chandy and his party men figured in the scam after records of the telephone conversations between Sarita and some members of the then chief minister’s personal staff got leaked. Chandy sought to quell the storm by removing them from his staff. However, it turned against him after the judicial panel decided to take cognisance of the letter Sarita wrote while she was in jail following her arrest in one of the cheating cases slapped against her by her customers. The commission headed by retired high court judge Justice G Sivarajan had submitted its report in September 2017, saying that top members of the political executive had sought and received bribes and sexual favours from Sarita to promote their business. The panel observed that sexual favours could be construed as illegal gratification as defined in the Prevention of Corruption Act and recommended action could be taken against those named in her letter, which was appended with its report. Accepting the report, the LDF government set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the findings and register cases against Chandy and others. However, North Zone DGP Rajesh Dewan, who headed the team, did not act on the direction, following legal advice that the allegation will not stand before a court of law. After the retirement of Dewan, his charge was handed over to ADGP (south zone) Anil Kant, but he too could not proceed as the state high court had by then expunged the commission's findings and observations against Chandy based on the letter. Saritha then lodged individual complaints against Chandy and five others, including former state ministers AP Anil Kumar and Aryadan Mohammed. Sources close to the new investigation team said that an FIR against the others will also be registered soon. Senior Congress leaders have termed the case politically motivated. They said that the LDF government has revived the case against legal advice to divert attention of the people from the explosive situation it has created in Sabarimala. Chandy, too, has subscribed to the view. “This has happened before also and now this fresh development has surfaced because of the issues in Sabarimala. I will deal with this case legally and on Monday in the state capital, I will reveal more details,” Chandy was   as saying. Social activists feel the case may embolden women, who have been shying away from joining the #MeToo campaign even after it has become a rallying point against sexual harassment in many parts of the country. Though Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), which emerged in the wake of the arrest of actor Dileep in an abduction case of an actor, spoke of rampant sexual harassment in the cinema industry, none of its members have named anybody so far. However, it has put the male-dominated Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) on tenterhooks by threatening to come out with their #MeToo stories at the appropriate time. Though three women from the industry have revealed the names, neither AMMA nor the police have taken it seriously. Actor and CPM MLA, Mukesh Kumar, who was the first to face the #MeToo heat in Kerala, has laughed off the charge levelled against him by Bollywood casting director Tess Joseph saying that he did not remember the incident, which is said to have happened in Chennai 19 years ago. Since then, two more women came out with stories of harassment they faced from the men in Mollywood. AMMA and other industry bodies have ignored the revelations. Members of the WCC are not surprised by their attitude. They said that they were more interested in finding a solution to the issue rather than exposing a few people. The women’s body has initiated the process for a permanent solution by seeking an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) within AMMA with third party experts on gender and from the judiciary as its members. It has already filed a writ petition in the high court in this regard.",2018-10-21,"ConnectTheDots,CPM,KC Venugopal,Kerala,MeToo,Oommen Chandy,Sabarimala,Saritha Nair,Sexual Assault,Solar Scam,Thiruvananthapauram","Solar scam accused alleges sexual abuse by Oommen Chandy, Congress leaders term case politically motivated",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/solar-scam-accused-alleges-sexual-abuse-by-oommen-chandy-congress-leaders-term-case-politically-motivated-5420011.html,firstpost,-1,0

Indo-Asian News Service," Hundreds of posters terming Priyanka Gandhi Vadra an ""emotional blackmailer"" were seen on Monday in Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of her mother and United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The posters which literally cropped up all around the Uttar Pradesh town overnight, showed her as ""missing"", and said while many tragedies struck the constituency since her last visit, Priyanka has not bothered to reach out to the people in the Congress borough where she is seen as her mother's heir. In a reference to her last minute visits to Rae Bareli during successive polls and trying to pitch in for her mother by striking the emotional chord of the relationship of the Gandhis with the area, the posters also called her an ""emotional blackmailer"". They said Priyanka plays with the sentiments of the Rae Bareli people only to garner votes. Carrying pictures of Congress president Rahul Gandhi's sibling the posters also asked her when would she visit Rae Bareli next. These posters have been plastered on walls on major thoroughfares, markets, public places like Tripula square and Hardaspur. They questioned her absence after major train accidents, including at Harchandpur, and the NTPC blast in Unchahar. They posed queries whether she would be present in her mothers constituency on Eid since she has not turned up on Hindu festivals like Navratri, Durga Puja and Dusshehra. Congress leaders and workers called the posters yet another ""dirty trick"" by opponents who were petrified by the ""comeback prospects of the Gandhis and the party to power in 2019 (after the Lok Sabha polls)"".

Sudeep Shukla, who was earning a salary of Rs 1 lakh per month, quit his job and decided to jump into politics to uplift poor and disabled people of the society. The 36-year-old engineer has been disillusioned with the lawmakers of past 70 years because he believes that they did nothing substantial to improve the lives of the deprived section. He felt that they only addressed people's issues during election time and that too, in order to garner votes. In frustration, he resigned from his job and decided to be the agent of change by contesting elections. Speaking to  , Sandeep with the help of an interpreter said, ""It is sad that even in cities like Delhi and Chennai, women are being raped. No leader is supporting them (victims).

Kangkan Acharyya,"Even as BJP national president Amit Shah launched the party's poll campaign in Mizoram on Wednesday, the church organisations — which have all along been vocal against the saffron party — have surprisingly chosen to remain silent. The silence of the church organisations at a time when the BJP has become part of ruling dispensations in six of the seven northeastern states has drawn multiple interpretations. Significantly, Mizoram is one among the three Christian states in the North East. The remaining two are Meghalaya and Nagaland. Nearly 87 percent of Mizos are Christians. “It is not only the presence of  large Christian population that makes them known as Christian states. The reason why these states are known as Christian states is rather political,” says renowned academician Professor Apurba Kumar Barua, who served a long term of his career as a teacher in the political science department in North Eastern Hill University. He adds that the churches in these three states wield tremendous influence on the state machinery and local politics, which is why they are known as Christian states. The influence of churches in these states’ politics has always been visible. Be it resisting BJP’s Hindutva politics or opposition of practicing yoga in schools, the churches have always made their stance clear on political issues. Even in Mizoram, churches were vocal against the Hindutva politics of the BJP, which had earlier put BJP on the back foot. In fact, the BJP went through a patchy phase in Mizoram just after the saffron party won over Assam in 2016 Assembly elections, as fear of upsurge in Hindutva politics in the region gripped the Christian state to the core. In an   published during that period, JV Hluna, the president of the state unit of the saffron party had lamented, “We are having a difficult time in convincing the church that Hindutva is not our agenda, but development is.” But Hluna, much to his surprise, has now observed that the resistance of the church against the BJP has subdued in the last two years. “Though there are still some fundamentalist forces spreading agenda against BJP, the Church is not against the party this time around,” he said. Interestingly, the BJP has now a far more powerful presence in the state than what it had earlier. In the 2013 Assembly election, the party had fielded 17 candidates in the state which has 40 Assembly segments. This has changed much as the party is confident enough to increase the number of candidates substantially. “We are likely to field 27 to 30 candidates this time around as our prospects have grown much brighter than what they were earlier,” says Hluna. Even though the party did not win a single seat in the 2013 Assembly election, it won 5 of the 20 seats in the Buddhist-dominated Chakma Autonomous District Council election held earlier this year. Has the church chosen to remain silent because it thinks the BJP has no chance of winning the election or becoming a part of the dispensation to be formed after the election? Or is it because the church fears losing its face in case people do not pay heed to its appeal and vote for the BJP, just in the lines of Nagaland Assembly polls held early this year? Chuanteya, a resident of Aizawl, told   that the BJP has every right to propagate its ideology but it is the people who are to decide whether they will accept it or not. “I cannot comment for the church. But as a citizen, I personally feel that Hindutva politics has hardly any scope in Mizoram, as the Mizos are mostly Christians. Irrespective of the outcome of the election, Hindutva is unlikely to gain foothold in Mizo society,” he said. On the other hand, another source in Mizoram, on condition of anonymity, says that BJP has no seat-sharing alliance in Mizoram and hence, people in the state have enough parties to vote for even if they do not vote for Congress and BJP. “This was not the case in Nagaland where the saffron party forged a seat-sharing alliance with Nationalist Democratic People’s Party, a regional outfit led by three-time Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio. People who were fed up with the ruling Naga People’s Front had to vote for BJP in many constituencies as there were hardly any plausible options for them,” the source said. Significantly, in Nagaland Assembly election held early this year, the BJP won 12 seats out of the 20 it fielded candidates for. In Nagaland, despite vehement opposition from the Church, the saffron party won more than 50 percent of the seats it fielded candidates in. But in Mizoram, Mizo National Front — a long-time ally of the NDA — has denied to forge any alliance with the BJP in the Assembly elections to be held in the month of November.  tried to contact Reverend Lalramliana Pachau, one of the most vocal Church representatives in Mizoram via phone and messages, but he is yet to respond as to why the Christian religious institutions have chosen to remain silent on the issue of BJP.",2018-10-19,"Amit Shah,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Christianity,Church,India,Mizoram Assembly Election 2018,Mizoram Polls,Neiphiu Rio,PoliticalPlay,Politics,Religion","Mizoram polls: Church organisations, which had been vocal against BJP, have suddenly gone silent",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mizoram-polls-church-organisations-which-had-been-vocal-against-bjp-have-suddenly-gone-silent-5411221.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"When in doubt, look for a second seat. Rajasthan chief minister   is reportedly following one of the oldest dictums of Indian politics by hunting for a constituency that she may be able to win with ease since her old bastion is under constant attack from the Congress. Two new seats are said to be on her radar—Rajakhera on the Rajasthan-UP border and Sriganganagar on the Rajasthan-Punjab border. If the BJP high command agrees with her decision, Raje may take out an electoral insurance by contesting from two seats in December. Her traditional seat, Jhalrapatan on the Rajasthan-Madhya Pradesh border, is the centre of a relentless and high-profile campaign by the Congress. A few days ago, while Raje was showing her strength in Ajmer, pocket borough of state Congress chief Sachin Pilot, the Congress invited Rahul Gandhi for a road show in the chief minister’s constituency. On Wednesday, Gandhi will be in Jhalrapatan again for an election rally and a roadshow that would cover a large portion of the chief minister’s territory. The Congress is working on a simple strategy—it wants to pin Raje down to her own constituency during the election, taking her away from the BJP campaign in the state. Since she is the only state BJP leader with a capacity to draw crowds, confining the chief minster to her constituency is one of the important set pieces of the Congress game plan. In Rajasthan’s politics, Raje has been one of the few leaders to have not lost an election in three decades. During this period, some of her contemporaries and predecessors like Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot lost at the hustings, but Raje maintained a clean record, winning nine elections — five for the Lok Sabha and four for the state assembly. And since her son Dushyant Singh has been winning Jhalawar — the parliamentary seat she vacated after becoming the chief minister — her electoral clout has remained unchallenged. However, the 2018 election might be different because of the rising tide of anti-incumbency in the state and her falling popularity. Several opinion polls suggest that the combined popularity of Pilot and Gehlot is almost double that of Raje. Also, the caste equations that helped Raje win Jhalrapatan have been rearranged by the anger among Rajputs and dissatisfaction among upper castes, both traditional voters of the BJP. In many ways, the anger against Raje is similar to the fury that Prem Singh Dhumal faced in Himachal Pradesh. The resentment is more because of her own image and performance, not because of the party. This is reflected in the popular slogan on the campaign trail that warns Raje of dire political consequences in spite of the voter’s love for Narendra Modi. Raje’s quest for a second seat is symptomatic of the BJP’s plight in the state. Wary of anti-incumbency and the voter’s penchant for booting out the government in every election, many BJP leaders are trying to shift to new constituencies. However, the BJP might take a policy decision disallowing a change of seat, primarily to hold incumbents accountable for their own destiny.",2018-10-22,"Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Jhalawar,Jhalrapatan,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje",Vasundhara Raje hunts for second seat in Rajasthan polls as Congress launches fierce campaign in her traditional bastion,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vasundhara-raje-hunts-for-second-seat-in-rajasthan-polls-as-congress-launches-fierce-campaign-in-her-traditional-bastion-5424271.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday demanded to know why the Centre was not applying the yardstick of equal treatment of women it used on the triple talaq issue to the Sabarimala row, and blamed the BJP for whipping up communal passions for electoral gains. The top Marxist party leader said roughing up of women journalists and the stir led by groups wearing saffron headbands at Sabarimala indicated a pattern seen during the demolition of Babri Masjid (1992) and blamed the RSS for it. Women journalists forming part of television crew were roughed up and ""it is exactly the pattern, which is also very similar at the time of Babri Masjid demolition...you have the heads of volunteers wearing saffron bands (leading protests),"" Yechury said. Such scenarios unfolded during the Babri protests and a ""similar thing is done here; it is an organised thing that the RSS is doing and that will be fought,"" he said. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would ""lose the Sabarimala battle,"" Yechury said. Asked if his party-led Left Democratic Front government in Kerala will oppose review pleas on Sabarimala issue before the Supreme Court, he said it was for the government to answer. In a historic judgment last month, the apex court had lifted the ban on entry of girls and women of menstrual age into the hill temple. Citing the Centre's advisory to Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to take precautionary measures in view of some Hindu outfits planning protests, he said law and order was being maintained by the Kerala government. ""Those disturbing law and order will be dealt with,"" Yechury told reporters in Chennai. On triple talaq, he said the Centre recently promulgated an ordinance making it illegal saying the practice was unequal treatment of women, he said. ""The government did that saying equality of men and women is fundamental to our constitution and that it should be protected."" ""Therefore triple talaq is unequal treatment of women and they brought this ordinance. Why they are not applying the same principle for Sabarimala?"" he asked. His party had taken a stand against triple talaq for its ""arbitary use and instant application so we said that needs to be reformed."" The Centre still has the option of going in for a legislation or ordinance to circumvent the apex court verdict on Sabarimala ""if they are really interested,"" the way it did for the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, he said. However, ""the real point here is to whip up communal polarisation with the hope that it will get some political and electoral benefit,"" he said. Accusing BJP of playing a ""worst form of vote bank politics,"" he said ""they are seeking the consolidation of Hindutva communal vote bank at the expense of destroying our social harmony, unity and integrity of our country and this is very dangerous."" He accused the BJP and Congress in Kerala of ""duplicity"" on Sabarimala issue, adding that both parties reversed their stand after initially welcoming the verdict. Yechury said the state-wise electoral strategy (for the Lok Sabha 2019 election) would be worked out as per the recent central committee meet resolve to defeat BJP and its allies, strengthen the CPM and the Left in Parliament and work for an alternate secular government at the Centre. The Muslim Women -Protection of Rights on Marriage-Ordinance was promulgated last month and a Bill in this regard was passed by Lok Sabha last year which is now pending in the Rajya

Ajay Singh,"History is the ruthless reckoner of facts and more often swayed by circumstances in assessment of individuals. One cannot grudge if ND Tiwari does not find a place even in the footnote of Indian political history. He may be casually referred to as a political philanderer who held chief minister’s position in Uttar Pradesh thrice and in Uttarakhand once. Such an assessment would be a gross injustice to Tiwari whose contribution to society and politics was immense. In his role as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Tiwari was perhaps the best administrator that Uttar Pradesh had ever seen. Given the tendency of the congress high command to keep party stalwarts unsettled, Tiwari was never allowed in Uttar Pradesh to remain for longer term. Yet, his vision for development was unique. Much before development came to the centre-stage of politics, Tiwari projected himself as “ ” (developmental man) in the country’s largest state. Those who worked with him still recall that his mild-mannerism concealed a tough administrator who would brook no nonsense when it came to taking decision. Let me recount certain instances to bring out Tiwari’s administrative acumen. After Indira Gandhi’s assassination, anti-Sikh riots broke out in Kanpur where thousands were killed by rampaging mobs. The then district magistrate was apparently guilty of letting the rioters roam freely and killing Sikhs around the metropolis. The district magistrate claimed himself to be close to the Nehru-Gandhi family. After a week, Tiwari sacked him. A delegation of noted industrialist from Kanpur and some eminent citizens rushed to Lucknow to request Tiwari to change his decision. Tiwari’s first response was: “I will talk about everything except the removal of the official."" His tone was so firm and categorical that the delegation did not broach the subject. In another instance, Tiwari was the chief minister when the foundation laying was done in Ayodhya at the disputed site in 1989. Tiwari was conscious of the fallout of this act and had opposed it but couldn’t do anything because of then home minister Buta Singh and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. How did you allow this to happen? I once asked him. He narrated the story as how Rajiv, along with Singh and an IPS officer went to see Devraha Baba, a much revered spiritual saint in the region, who said, “  (Boy, let it happen)”. “  (And the boy indeed let it happen),” he said jokingly. Of course, Tiwari was then distancing himself from Rajiv’s politics of temple. He made it clear that the foundation laying was ordained by Rajiv not him. IAS and IPS officers who worked with him still recall his morning phone call to inquire about incidents reported in morning newspapers and the administration’s response. “He would always begin with respectful appellation like DM Sahab or SSP Sahab which was so soothing to ears,” said an IAS officer associated with him for a long time. In Uttar Pradesh, Tiwari gave the concept of developing industrial estates across the state and making industrial hubs which were quite similar to SEZs being developed now. Uttar Pradesh’s most promising township Noida was conceptualised and had started taking shape during Tiwari’s time. What was strikingly different in Tiwari’s style of functioning with others in Uttar Pradesh was the inculcation of a culture of governance which kept criminals at bay. This was quite a daunting task in Uttar Pradesh as chief ministers right since Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna had begun patronising criminals. Tiwari did follow the pattern but kept his governance largely unaffected by the Mafia culture of the state. For a generation of a bureaucrats inducted in the administration in the nineties, such a situation would be difficult even to imagine in Uttar Pradesh now. Tiwari slipped on the cusp of history in 1991 to go for precipitous decline after Rajiv's assassination in 1991. Though a front runner for the prime minister, he lost Lok Sabha polls in Nainital and forfeited the chance of becoming the country’s top political executive. Had he not lost the election then, Tiwari would have been remembered differently despite his follies. In his life’s weaker moments, he surrounded himself with controversies and salacious stories that started defining him. But history would be doing gross injustice if Tiwari is only remembered for that.",2018-10-20,"Anti-Sikh Riots,Ayodhya Dispute,Congress,Criminalisation,Development,Development Of Uttar Pradesh,Indira Gandhi Assassination,InMemoriam,ND Tiwari,ND Tiwari Passes Away,Noida,Rajiv Gandhi,Ram Temple Issue,SEZ,Uttar Pradesh,Vikas Purush","A tough administrator, ND Tiwari introduced concept of industrial hubs to Uttar Pradesh, kept criminals out of governance",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/a-tough-administrator-nd-tiwari-introduced-concept-of-industrial-hubs-to-uttar-pradesh-kept-criminals-out-of-governance-5414651.html,firstpost,-1,0

Ishfaq Naseem," The BJP won the elections to 100 municipal wards in Kashmir in the urban local bodies (ULB) polls, whose results were declared on Saturday, trouncing the Congress in its bastions as it rode on the support of the Kashmiri Pandit (KP) voters. BJP benefited as its arch rival didn’t field candidates in many seats. As per the results which were declared, the BJP — for the first time in the electoral history of the state — managed to win 100 seats. While it bagged 24 seats through a contest, it won other 76 seats uncontested. BJP’s gain came at the expense of Congress, which won a total of 157 seats, including 78 uncontested. The independents won a total of 178 wards and emerged victorious in 103 seats through a contest while there was no contest in 75 other wards. In south Kashmir’s Devsar Municipal Committee (MC), BJP won all the eight wards as its Muslim candidates were elected from the area. Likewise from Qazigund Municipal Committee, four BJP candidates were elected while three seats were vacant. Congress’ Devsar MLA, Mohammad Amin Bhat, said that the party didn’t field candidates in Qazigund and Devsar. “Before the elections, incidents of militancy had stepped up. Due to the security scenario, we didn’t field any candidates.” “The BJP has largely won the seats by fielding candidates who are not known to people or by making the KPs contest. How can Kashmiri Pandits who are settled in Jammu carry out development in Kashmir?” he said. From Municipal Council Sopore, which is represented by Congress in the Assembly, BJP has won 7 seats. In one ward, an independent candidate was elected while 13 other wards are vacant. Congress' Sopore MLA, Haji Abdul Rasheed, also said that the party didn’t field any candidate in Sopore. Even from the Municipal Committee Dooru, the BJP won two seats while 15 were bagged by the Congress.

The BJP has even won from the three wards of Municipal Committee Langate, bastion of Awami Ittehad party (AIP) president, Er Rashid. Other 10 wards have been won by the independent candidates. The contest in Kashmir has been largely between the independents backed by People’s Conference (PC) chairman, Sajad Gani Lone, Congress and the BJP.  Both the NC and PDP have boycotted the polls, claiming that Government of India (GoI) was trying to scrap Article 35-A, which bars outsiders from owning properties in Kashmir. In the polls which were held in four phases in Kashmir, the turnout was negligible in the range of 3 to 4 percent, which was termed by separatists as a “vindication that the Kashmiris are seeking freedom from Indian rule.”",2018-10-20,"Devsar,India,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Urban Local Body Polls,Kashmiri Pandits,NewsTracker,Politics,Tral","Jammu and Kashmir urban local body polls: BJP trounces Congress in its bastions, wins from many militancy-hit areas",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-urban-local-body-polls-bjp-trounces-congress-in-its-bastions-wins-from-many-militancy-hit-areas-5416431.html,firstpost,-1,0
Asian News International,": Responding to the comparison drawn by Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) general secretary Sitaram Yechury between the violence in Sabarimala and the uproar witnessed during the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) spokesperson Vinod Bansal said the Sabarimala Temple was southern India's Ayodhya. Speaking to  , Bansal thanked the devotees who have been aggressively protesting against the Supreme Court's verdict that quashed restrictions imposed on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple. ""Good that Sitharam Yechury has himself compared Sabarimala with Ayodhya because yes Sabarimala is South's Ayodhya. The way sanctity, religious belief and the serenity of Sabarimala have been attacked shows the reality of the CPM. The CPM remains blind and ignorant on Kerala nun suffering, the way non-Hindus are appointed in Travancore Devaswom Board. I appreciate and thank the people who are protesting and saving the sanctity of the temple,"" the VHP spokesperson said. On 19 October, Yechury had termed the violence witnessed in Sabarimala as ""the worst form of vote bank politics being played in the country at the expense of destroying social harmony."" ""All the TV crews who went there which had women were roughed up; the pattern is very similar to the time of the Babri Masjid demolition. You have the heads of the volunteers wearing saffron bands, the same dress you found there then,"" he added. Alleging that the RSS is involved in the temple violence, the CPM general secretary underscored: ""Similar thing is being done here (Sabarimala Temple). The RSS is doing this."" Three days after the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala opened its doors for the first time for women of all age groups as per the Supreme Court verdict pronounced on 28 September, no woman of menstrual age has yet been able to visit the shrine because of continuous protests. A number of devotees blocked the entry of women trekking up to the hill shrine. The doors of the temple opened on Wednesday at 5 pm and will close on October 22. While reacting on delaying of construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Bansal asserted, ""The Ram Temple construction should start as soon as possible. I have full faith that the Supreme Court's verdict on 29 October will be on Ram Temple's favour."" The Babri Masjid, built by Mughal emperor Babur in Ayodhya in 1528, was, on December 6, 1992, pulled down allegedly by a group of Hindu activists, claiming that the mosque was constructed after demolishing a Ram Temple that originally stood there.

Press Trust of India," Targeting caretaker Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged 4,500 farmers have committed suicides in Telangana during the past four years, and claimed the state is reeling under a debt of Rs two lakh crore. Speaking at a public meeting in Kamareddy as part of the campaign for the 7 December Assembly polls, he said KCR (asRao is popularly known) neglected farmers and their problems but had spent Rs 300 crore of public money to construct a palatial bungalow in the state capital, referring to ""Pragati Bhavan"", the chief minister's residence. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and KCR have a ""friendship"", adding Rao supports any decision of BJP. ""Now, MIM has joined KCR in helping Modi,"" he said, but did not elaborate. ""Telangana farmers played an important role in the state formation. In the same Telangana, 4,500 farmers committed suicide in the past four years. Farmers seeking support price were handcuffed in the state."" ""KCR pushed the state into debt. Telangana has now Rs two lakh crore debt. There is debt of Rs 2.60 lakh on every family in Telangana. Every citizen of Telangana carries a debt burden of Rs 60,000,"" the Congress president said. Gandhi alleged KCR had failed to exert pressure on the centre for setting up turmeric Board in Nizamabad. KCR also failed to take steps to reopen Nizam Sugar Factory which was shut down in the past, he alleged. Taking potshots at Modi and KCR, he said both the leaders indulge in corruption in the name of 'redesigning' projects. ""KCR is supporting BJP in Telangana. Whatever policy decision is taken by the BJP government (at the centre), KCR supports it and stands by them,"" he added. ""Modi announced note ban and took out all the money from your pocket and gave it to Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya and Anil Ambani... Now along with KCR, MIM is also supporting Modi,"" the Congress leader charged. Gandhi promised that one lakh government jobs will be filled within one year after coming to power in Telangana. ""People have realised that in the last five years the chief minister has only indulged in corruption,"" he said. Earlier speaking at a public meeting at Bhainsa in Nirmal district, he said farm loan up to Rs two lakh would be waived at one go, if his party is voted to power, even as he also targeted Modi for making ""false promises."" He also alleged KCR insulted BR Ambedkar by changing the name of a project named after him and indulged in corruption by changing the project designs and inflating its cost from Rs 38,000 crore to Rs one lakh crore. ""Why was it made into Rs one lakh crore (project)? ... because the Chief Minister wants to indulge in corruption,"" he charged. Gandhi accused Rao of indulging in corruption, giving benefits to his family. ""As soon as he became CM, KCR started indulging in corruption, giving all the benefits to his family,"" Gandhi said. He said farmers were committing suicide all over the country because they couldn't get proper price for their produce. ""Thousands of farmers committed suicide in Telangana because they don't get proper price (for their produce). Neither Modi nor KCR is able to provide farmers good price,"" he added. The Congress chief said change would come in Telangana and accused Rao and Modi of making false promises. ""Change will come in Telangana. KCR government will go. And in Delhi, Narendra Modi's government will go. I did not come here to make false promises. If you want to listen to false promises, then go to KCR and Modi they will give you false promises,"" he added. ""The moment Congress comes to power in Telangana, we will protect tribal lands. We will give Rs 3,000 allowance each to unemployed youth,"" Gandhi said. He said the KCR government had failed to fulfil promises such as job for every family, three acres of land to every SC/ST family and two bedroom houses for all eligible people. The AICC leader also alleged that Rao also failed to implement 12 per cent quota for STs and drinking water to every family. ""Similarly, Modi also failed to keep up the promised Rs 15 lakh in each and every bank account, two crore jobs for Indian youth every year and fair price for farmers."" Gandhi also accused Modi of spreading hatred and enmity and said ""he pits people of one religion against the other, one region against another, one caste against another, and weakens the country"". The Congress moves forward by taking everybody together, he said. Firing salvos at Modi on the Rafale deal, Gandhi said the prime minister owes answers to the nation. He alleged that Modi who calls himself the ""watchman"" of the country ""has turned out to be a thief"" by ""helping his friend"" Anil Ambani to get a Rs 30,000 crore contract in the Rafale deal. Rahul Gandhi and his Congress party have been attacking the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafale deal, alleging corruption and favouritism.

Press Trust of India," Refuting allegations that he was trying to influence the proceedings in the National Herald case with his tweets, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday told a Delhi court that he does not remember the social media posts cited by the Congress. Swamy was responding to Congress leader Motilal Vora's application seeking the court's order to restrain him from tweeting about the case in which Vora is an accused along with his party chief Rahul Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader told the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal that he was afraid that the tweets cited by Vora “may be tampered with”, but maintained that he had “every right to tweet”. “I can't remember the tweets. I made countless tweets and do not know whether those cited by the applicant (Vora) are mine,” Swamy said. “The copies of tweets are not admissible under law and do not count as evidence to press on their application. If I do not know what are the evidence, how will I proceed further? I have every right to tweet. But the evidence you claim are not evidence since they are not certified,” he added. He further argued that there was no evidence that his tweets were defamatory and therefore, Vora's application should be ""dismissed"". “They have not brought anything to show that the tweets, even if true, are defamatory to anyone. This is a case of corruption. it contains public interest. The country is moving to a more open society,"" Swamy said. ""There is no evidence in this case and this application should be dismissed with a cost,” he added. Senior advocate RS Cheema, representing Vora, said Swamy did not deny the allegations in the written submissions filed by the BJP leader. “This is contempt of court. When we filed application citing tweets, he did not deny them in his written submissions. He is interfering with my work as an advocate,” Cheema said, after which the court reserved its order on the application for November 17. The BJP leader, in a private criminal complaint, had accused the Gandhis and others of conspiring to cheat and misappropriate funds by paying just Rs 50 lakh, through which Young Indian Pvt Ltd (YI) obtained the right to recover Rs 90.25 crore that Associate Journals Ltd owed to the Congress. Vora had earlier told the court that Swamy was indulging in ""character assassination"" of the accused persons by tweeting. ""The complainant (Swamy) is also insulting the lawyers appearing for the accused persons and trying to influence the ongoing probe by commenting on the merits of the case,"" the counsel had said. Vora, also represented by advocate Tarannum Cheema, had requested the court to pass an injunction order restraining Swamy from tweeting about the case. In his application, Vora said he has time and again noticed that the complainant (Swamy) has been putting up various posts on social media regarding the daily proceedings of the case to defame the accused and for the vilification of the court process. Vora also alleged that Swamy had been indulging in ""loud and persistent publicity"", amounting to an interference with the administration of justice. The application said, ""Before and after every date of hearing he (Swamy) unleashes hostile publicity through tweets, posts on social media or statements to the media."" All the seven accused — the Gandhis, Motilal Vora (All India Congress Committee treasurer), Oscar Fernandes (AICC general secretary), Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda and YI — have denied the allegations levelled against them in the case. The court had summoned the accused persons, besides YI, on 26 June, 2014. On 19 December, 2015, it had granted bail to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Vora, Fernandes and Dubey, who had appeared before it pursuant to summonses. Pitroda was also granted bail on 20 February, 2016 when he had appeared in the court.

The party announced the move at a press conference. Congress leaders believe his joining the party will help bring in Rajput votes in the assembly polls. Singh (54), who won Barmer's Sheo constituency as the BJP candidate in 2013 assembly elections, had announced at a rally last month that he is leaving the Bharatiya Janata Party. “Kamal ka Phool Badi Bhool', he had said then, claiming that going with the BJP's election symbol, the lotus, was a “big mistake”. Congress leaders claimed his move will help bring Rajput votes to the party-fold while the BJP said the MLA's “politically wrong decision” will have no impact on the ruling party. “Manvendra Singh will join the Congress tomorrow in Delhi in the presence of party president Rahul Gandhi,” Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot told   on Tuesday. “There is a long list of leaders quitting the BJP and the party should introspect why this is happening,” he said. ”We are welcoming Manvendra Singh and this will strengthen the party.” He added the party will ensure his active participation in the upcoming assembly elections in the state.",2018-10-17,"Congress,Jaswant Singh,Manvendra Singh,NewsTracker,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan","BJP leader Jaswant Singh's son Manvendra joins Congress, meets Rahul Gandhi in presence of other party members",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-leader-jaswant-singhs-son-manvendra-joins-congress-meets-rahul-gandhi-in-presence-of-other-party-members-5394501.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid on Wednesday said switching over of two Goa Congress MLAs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a ""setback"" for the saffron party as the latter speaks of ""principle politics"", but practises something opposite to it. ""You can call it a setback (for us) but I believe it is a setback for the BJP as they speak of principled politics. They complain that everything was wrong before they came to power and now, every day, we see them function in a manner that is extremely questionable. ""MLAs that go today can come back tomorrow, who were there (on opposition benches) can come here (ruling side)...is that the kind of politics that we want?"" he asked. ""It is sad that those we cherished and worked with leave Congress and go to the BJP at this time when everybody is thinking of leaving BJP and coming to Congress. Let us see how things turn out,"" Khurshid told reporters after visiting the College Square Puja Marquee. Two Congress MLAs from Goa, including a former state party chief, joined the BJP on Tuesday,   in a state where the saffron party-led alliance government enjoys a thin majority. Subhash Shirodkar and Dayanand Sopte, both of whom have resigned from the assembly,   Tuesday in the national capital. The MLA duo was later inducted into the saffron party at a press conference addressed by Union minister Piyush Goyal. Talking on the Sabarimala issue, Khurshid said there are different points of view in society, and that the Supreme Court has tried its best to find a correct answer for this issue. ""We have to accept what the Supreme Court finally decides and if we have any problem, then we can go back to the Supreme Court and explain. ""I think just as much as it is important to respect religion, it is important to respect institutions of our constitution, and for all sensible and responsible citizens, it is important to maintain a balance,"" he said. The process of dialogue must not come to an end in our society.

Press Trust of India,"Nationalistic Congress Party (NCP) would contest five of the 40 seats of the Mizoram Legislative Assembly in the forthcoming election to be held on 28 November.

The NGO Coordination Committee had appealed to political parties not to put up candidates from the Chakma community from these two specific seats. The NCP would contest from the two seats only if other parties field candidates belonging to the Chakma community, he said.

FP Staff,".  We have assembled here to celebrate the auspicious occasion of this year’s Vijayadashami. This year is the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji. When our entire society, by forgetting the truth inherited from the ancient tradition and the natural self of Bharat, got itself neck deep in a cesspool of hypocrisy, falsehood, selfishness and divide; became weak, defeated and disintegrated; and was getting fragmented by repeated thrashing of the brutal atrocities perpetrated by the cruel, intolerant, savage foreign invaders from across the border, Shri Guru Nanak Deo ji showed a new path of self-enlightenment based on the spiritual practice commensurate with the times through his life, gave the society a new life of oneness by ameliorating the strayed tradition. It is his legacy that gave the country a magnificent and majestic tradition of 10 gurus who removed our state of penury and inferiority. Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated, provided the political foundation of truth and non violence to the independence movement of the country. This unique struggle for freedom was an outcome of the continuous enlightenment provided by the very same inclusive culture, based on love and truth, as propounded by several great personalities of this country from time to time. All such efforts inspired the common man of the country to come out of his home and stand firmly with a moral force against the British oppression. The remembrance of martyrdom, sacrifice and dedication of hundreds of our unarmed countrymen, who were encircled from all sides and became victims of General Dyer’s bullets, hundred years ago while opposing the repressive and unjust Rowlett act and demanding freedom in the Jaliawala Bagh at Amritsar, invokes the same moral force in us. It is imperative to mention these relevant reminiscences this year because although our country has achieved a significant level of progress in many sectors during the 71 years of Independence, we have yet to move forward in many other dimensions of progress in our all encompassing national life. Several forces whose selfish designs are being defeated or hindered because of our progress as a well organized, strong and prosperous country have not retracted from plotting skullduggeries to block the path of our nation. We have yet to cross many a hurdles. We can achieve this feat by treading the path of those great ancestors who have established such hoary ideals and propagated them in the society by their exemplary life based on truthfulness, piousness, penance, affection and sacrifice. The same message is evident when we see the present play of hope and despair in the country when we take a glance at the national scenario. Border Security and internal security of the country are the issues of foremost consideration as they ensure space and opportunity to the nation for making efforts towards prosperity and development. Fruitful efforts have been undertaken to entwine the web of international relations by appraising the nations with our security concerns and getting their backing and cooperation. The military, government and administration have displayed its clear intent to maintain peaceful and cordial relations with all the countries including the neighbouring ones in words and deeds, at the same time standing and acting firm and making prudent use of our capabilities while initiating bold actions wherever necessary in the context of national security. In this regard efforts are being initiated and accelerated to enhance the morale of our armed and security forces, making them well-equipped and to provide them with latest technologies. This is one of the reasons that the prestige of Bharat is rising in the world. Along with this, it is essential to be more attentive in enhancing the basic amenities of armed and security forces and their families. There have been some laudable efforts in this regard by the government. A thought must be given as to how its implementation can be expedited? From administrative point of view, it is imperative that the planning and implementation of these schemes 2 have to pass through the military officers and civilian administrative authorities and Departments like Home, Defense and Finance. All these actors need to be more sensitive and respectful to the endeavours of these forces and their readiness to make a supreme sacrifice even by putting their lives at stake is a natural expectation that comes up in many discussions. Every countryman needs to keep this in mind that such an expectation is sought from the society as well, as it is from the government and administration. It is utmost essential that our brethren fighting for the security of the society across the border and within the country wherever required do their tasks without any worries for the social security and wellbeing of their families. After the change of guard in the country across our Western borders, any decline in its overt and covert provocative activities especially in the states like Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, neither has happened nor was expected. In view of the dynamic international developments, safeguarding of our maritime borders has also assumed greater significance. There are hundreds of islands at various distances in the coastal area of Bharat adjacent to the mainland. All these islands including Andaman Nicobar are situated at strategically important locations. From the security point of view, their maintenance and strengthening of the facilities there has to be attended and implemented as a matter of urgency. Expeditious attention needs to be given to have coordination, cooperation and resources among Navy and other forces guarding the maritime borders and islands. Our brethren habituating along the land and sea borders are firmly holding the ground with determination despite facing several challenges peculiar to the border areas. If their wellbeing is taken care of, these locals in the bordering areas can also be of great assistance in tackling problems like infiltration, smuggling etc. Both the government and society need to take more efforts so that relief, education, healthcare facilities and employment opportunities reach them in time and they are imbued with patriotism, valour and virtues. The country cannot be assured about its security without the total self reliance in the field of defense production even while continuing with the multilateral exchanges wherever necessary. The pace of national efforts in this direction has to be accelerated. The issue of internal security is equally important along with the border security of the country. The Union, as well as the State governments and administrations should sternly deal with the violent activities of elements, motivated or moved from inside as well as outside the borders, who challenge the law, Constitution and sovereignty of the country, is one of its remedial aspects. The Union and State governments and police and paramilitary forces are successfully undertaking operations in this regard. They will have to continue it with the incessant vigil. But, it is a matter of fact that such elements who take part in violent and evidently illegal activities come from our own society. At the root of this is ignorance, dearth of development and amenities, unemployment, injustice, exploitation, discrimination and absence of sensitivity and sanity of our society essential in an independent nation. The Government and administration do have a role to play in alleviating this. But a greater responsibility lies with the society. An atmosphere of warmth and goodwill needs to be propagated by eliminating all such discrepancies within the society and embracing these brethren of our society with dignity and affection. The societal manifestation of this will have to start with the refinement of one’s own conscience and conduct. An intimate and regular contact will have to be maintained with all sections of the society by becoming part of their thick and thin. It is felt that Central and State governments have to be more transparent and should exhibit greater efficiency and sensitivity in effective and timely implementation of several plans, sub plans and various provisions made for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes. Police forces are the first to take the call with respect to internal security. The National Police Commission has also made recommendations for reforms in their systems. It is necessary to ponder over these recommendations pending for several years and make efforts towards such reforms. The establishment running the country and the society at large need to show alacrity in assuring progress, empathetic response, transparent and respectful behavior in the efforts for upliftment of the weaker sections of the society. The lack of all this makes it easy to sow and grow the seeds of doubt, detachment, imprudence, rebellion, hatred and violence in these sections that are 3 severely affected due to the deprivation, injustice and negligence. Taking advantage of this, the forces with selfish motives desirous of using them as cannon fodder in the anti-national and criminal activities play deceitful games among them. This trend can be understood by everyone from the continuous efforts during the last 4 years to give a specific tone to the agitations originated in some undesirable incident in the society, old and new issues bothering different sections of the society and long-standing or emerging demands. The selfish power hungry politics with sheer disrespect for the social harmony, legal and Constitutional discipline and with an eye on votes in the upcoming elections have been apparently clear behind these machinations. But this time an atmosphere of divergence, separatism, violence, acerbic hatred and going to the extent of fueling anti-national sentiments is being created by exploiting these grievances. The leading faces of the groups from whom the slogans like ‘भारत तेरेटुकड़ेहोंगे’ were emanated, have been at the forefront with their provocative speeches in such incidents at some places. When the violent activities in remote forest areas were dealt with firmly, those leading and abetting violence were seen at the forefront of these agitations as votaries of Urban Naxalism. To start with, an ideological follower group is created through a network of small groups and regular contact in the student hostels. Then, by infusing rabid violent acts in small and big agitations, giving anarchical experience, the fear of law and administration and the civic discipline is being systematically eroded among those followers. On the other side, scorn and hatred is generated within the society and against the prevalent establishment and leadership. Through such incidents getting instantaneously violent, thought leadership in all sections of the society - which by and large stays within the social order and civic discipline - is sought to be suddenly discredited. To establish a new, unfamiliar, uncontrolled, outrightly biased Naxal leadership with blind followers solely committed to them is the ‘Neo – Left’ doctrine of these urban Naxals. Their cohorts already established in social and other media, intellectual circles and other institutions are associated with such activities from start to finish. They execute this by defending such activities through intellectual and other methods, through delusory public campaigns related to agitations, while keeping a safe distance and maintaining their so-called eminent positions. They are experts in freely using deceit and poisonous provocative language to make their vicious campaign even more potent. Treasonous activity by taking help from enemies of the nation is considered as an additional skill. It can be unmistakably seen if we investigate the source of the content and narration in their social media campaigns. The actual presence of Jihadi and terrorist elements in one way or other in such incidents is a common factor among all these. So the emerging conclusion is, this is a bigger canny conspiracy in collusion with forces from within and outside the country. It no more remains just a power politics by the opposition, but in this process, politically ambitious individuals and groups — either knowingly or unknowingly — and weaker sections, crushed under deprivation and neglect get drawn as ammunition unknowingly or unwillingly. Through the manufacturing of vicious and hostile atmosphere that weakens and destroys the social cohesion - essentially the bedrock of internal security of a nation – a world of psychological warfare is being carved out. This is called as ‘Mantrayuddh’ in our traditional Rajneeti Shastras. To eliminate such tendencies, the Government and administration have to alertly ensure that such incidents, of which trouble mongers can take advantage of do not take place. At the same time, they will have to keep a constant vigil on such incendiary elements and forces so that they are not able to perpetrate such nuisance. Slowly, in the absence of any support from society, these incendiary elements will be completely defused. The administration has to make its intelligence gathering mechanism more comprehensive and alert. The schemes for the public good will have to reach the last man of the society through their prompt implementation. It will have to work with skill and diligence to ascertain law and order. But an accurate and complete mitigation of these circumstances is possible only when all sections of the society interact with the disposition of kinship and goodwill in thought and heart. We need to see the diversity of sects and religions, castes and sub-castes, languages and provinces as expressions of unity. The entire society should own problems and conditions specific to any section of society to find a just and amicable solution through a cordial dialogue. An atmosphere where there can be uninterrupted friendly dialogue should be nurtured through greater contact and camaraderie. Citizens should follow the ambit of law and order and public discipline in their daily life. In this connection, every citizen and politician may remember the famous speech by Hon. Dr. Babasaheb 4 Ambedkar delivered on 25th November 1949 wherein he advocates that without all pervasive fraternity in the society, it is not conceivable for the country to move in the direction of justice, freedom and equality and to attain social democracy along with political and economic democracy. The safety of these democratic values and our independence can be endangered without these. The means we adopted to raise our concerns when we were British subjects may be done away after attaining independence. We need to adopt only Constitutional methods, within the ambit of the democratic discipline. Bhagini Nivedita has also considered civic consciousness as the manifestation of patriotism in the daily life of a citizen. A firm and absolute consensus on these issues among the polity, judiciary, executive, local administration, organizations, dignitaries and common public and a feeling of intimate oneness in the society can be the only guarantee of stability, development and security of the country. These virtues should be instilled in the new generation of society from childhood itself at home, in schools and through social activities. Today, it has become pertinent that the younger generation gets the foundational virtues of humanity and good character in family life. Nowadays, the education curricula and the general atmosphere of the society almost lack these values. Time is running out in the wait for the implementation of the new education policy. Even though there are many individuals and organizations making efforts for these changes both at societal and government levels, our home and family are always in our hands for making such efforts. It is necessary to see whether we are fulfilling our responsibility towards the new generation to shape their minds with virtues of natural affection, self discretion, family and social responsibility and by setting our own example of prudence in an informal and pious environment or not. A need is being felt world over to be extra attentive due to the changing times. With the increasing reach and influence of media, gadgets with newer technologies that make individuals self-centred and expose them to right and wrong information and knowledge of the world without taking into cognizance their discretionary abilities, it is all the more necessary to acquire the values of family traditions. A discretionary capacity needs to be generated in the young generation with affection and our own example, for accepting the worth emanating from the new world with an open mind; and to guard themselves and others against the evil on the basis of our value system. The news reports about incidents of suffering in families, indebtedness, immoral behavior and rape from the near and dear ones, suicides, caste conflicts and discrimination in the country are definitely a matter of concern and pain. Ultimately, the solutions to these problems lie in creating an affectionate and family atmosphere and social harmony. In this perspective, the entire society, including luminaries and leading intellectuals, need to take up the duty in this direction. All those who are leading the society in various fields should keep in mind that every action, speech and thought of ours should nourish all including the individual, family, society, humanity and the environment. Nowhere in the world, healthy and peaceful social life has ever thrived and can thrive, merely based on the laws and fear of punishment. Society abiding by laws is not the reason but the result of its ethical standards derived from the comprehension of the traditional social values. To adopt the customs and conventions with changing times, one may change the ethical practices and rules but by remaining firm on the edifice of values. The real and complete Justice is done by interweaving of the four elements in consonance, namely, the natural instincts of desire and wealth that form the societal functioning; ethics that restraints such instincts, making them useful and giving through them satisfaction and happiness with pleasure; the legal system that ensures that society and families follow this discipline enshrined in these ethics; and the comprehension of values being the decisive factor in all these. The decisions taken without considering all aspects and patiently creating the mindset of the society, will neither be adopted in actual practice nor will they help in creating a new social order in tune with changing times and positions. The situation arising out of the recent verdict on Sabarimala temple shows the similar predicament. The nature and premise of the tradition that has been accepted by society and continuously followed for years together were not taken into 5 consideration. The version of heads of religious denominations and faith of crores of devotees was not taken into account. The plea by a large section of women, who follows this tradition, was not heard to. The legal verdict has given rise to unrest, turmoil and divisiveness in the society in place of peace, stability and equality. The questions such as why only the Hindu society experiences such repeated and brazen onslaughts on its symbols of faith, obviously rise in the public mind and lead to unrest. This situation is not at all conducive for the peace and healthiness of the society. Bharat’s progress will have to be achieved by rejuvenating all precincts of national life, being rooted in its eternal ethos. Whatever is available within the country will have to be rectified, reformed or if necessary, completely discarded as per times and situation; and accepting whatever is noble and useful around the world and adapt them as per the requirements of the country; Both these decisions would be based on the same ethos. This is the characteristic trait of our nation. This is ‘Hindutva’. Any country can progress by being resolute and steadfast on its original character, and not by blind copying. The administrative sensitivity, alacrity, transparency and totality in the implementation of good policies of the Government are still not up to the expectations. Resultantly, the outcome of those policies is not percolating down to the last man standing in the society. The foreign British rule and administration were merely overlords of the land and territories. In the Independent Bharat, our rulers are expected to make the administration people-centric. Political freedom is not complete in itself. All the dimensions of national life have to be reorganized on the basis of ‘swa’ (self) and self-esteem that inspired us and breathed our life with the sense of ‘we the people’ during the freedom struggle. Aspirations of people of Independent Bharat have been articulated in the four different parts of our Constitution, namely, the preamble, fundamental rights, the directive principles, and fundamental duties. We will have to establish our own model of development in the light of these provisions. Our goals, directions and accordingly all aspects of national life, including the economic one, have to be steered with this spirit. Then all our efforts and policies will be seen as fully implemented and fruitful. Even after adopting the noble principles from the world, it is absolutely essential for the progress of the nation that we devise our own distinct model of development and corresponding framework based on our philosophical foundation. In this very same context of honouring the ‘Swa’ of the nation, Sangh has been associated with the sentiments of crores of countrymen, in the efforts of constructing a magnificent Ram temple at the birthplace of Shree Ram who is the personification of the life energy of the nation and an icon of upholding Dharma. The place of Janmabhoomi is yet to be allocated for the construction of the temple although all kinds of evidence have affirmed that there was a temple at that place. There is an obvious game-plan of a few elements to stall the judgment by presenting various newer interventions in the judicial process. It is in nobody’s interest to test the patience of the society without any reason. The construction of the temple is necessary from the self-esteem point of view; it will also pave the way for an atmosphere of goodwill and oneness in the country. This matter of national interest is being obstructed by some fundamentalist elements and forces that play communal politics for selfish gains. Despite such machinations, the decision regarding ownership of the land should be expedited, and the Government should clear the path for construction of the grand temple through appropriate and requisite law. Who would lead the nation? Are prevalent policies right or wrong? All these things have to be decided by the ordinary voters every five years, as a part of his ordained duty, in the democratic system of our country. Such five-yearly elections are approaching ahead. In a way, through this right, we the people of Bharat, common citizens become the adjudicators and controllers of our national scenario. But, we also know that the decision we make on that single day of the election makes us bear the brunt of good and bad effects in the short term as well as the long-lasting gains and losses for 6 many years, sometimes throughout the lifetime. We are left with nothing else in our hands after that single day. If we have to get the verdict which will not lead to repentance then the voters will have to rise above self, parochial feelings, petty egos of caste, language and provincial affiliations, keeping in mind that the national interest is supreme. The voters will have to ponder over dispassionately upon the sincerity and capability of the candidate, commitment of the party on the issues of national interest and for the integrity of the nation and experiences of past and present actions of both candidates and parties. The characteristic of democratic politics is such that no one can be considered as completely right or wrong. In such a situation, non-voting or using the provision of None of the Above (NOTA) goes in favour of the one who is most ineffective. So, 100 per cent voting is essential keeping in mind national interest as supreme without getting swayed by the campaigns of all the sides. The Election Commission of Bharat also appeals for the hundred per cent voting and conscience voting. The RSS swayamsevaks have always been abided by this as a duty as citizens and will do so this time as well. Since its inception, RSS has kept itself aloof from the party politics and the politics influenced by castes and creeds and will continue to do so. But the number of Swayamsevaks spread all over the country, should fulfill their duty as citizens and stand in favour of putting their strength behind the overall national good. This is an essential task in the national interest. The existence of a powerful, virtuous and organised society based on the distinct axiom of ‘Swa’ of the nation is the fundamental and essential prerequisite of national well-being. That identity is Hindu identity that teaches us to respect all, accept all, unite all and do good to all. That is why Sangh wishes to establish a strong, invincible organised Hindu society and will comprehensively achieve this goal. Those sections of the society who consider themselves ‘separate’ because of their religion, tradition and lifestyle or apprehensive of the word ‘Hindu’ need to understand that Hindutva is the eternal ethos of this country. While keeping its core eternal values unchanged, there had been changes in its content and conduct commensurate with times and situations and will happen so in the future as per the needs. Hindutva has intrinsic identification with the undivided land of Bharat from the Himalayas up to the seas. All the Bharatiyas should immerse themselves in the hue of Bharat’s culture ingrained in its ethos is a sincere wish of the Sangh. The practices of all the sects and traditions of Bharat derive themselves from this cultural ethos. The luminaries, who have toiled hard and devoted their lives to protect and nourish the society, are our ancestors and the symbols of prestige to all of us. Hindutva is behind Bharat’s capacity to embrace the entire universe with acceptance and appreciation of all its distinct diversities. That is why Bharat is the Hindu Rashtra. An organised Hindu society is the bedrock of unity, integrity and sustainable progress of the nation. The acceptance of eternal Hindutva ethos is the panacea for fundamentalism, petty selfishness, unrestrained consumerism arising out of hardcore materialism and insensitivity. Therefore, organizing Hindus is a mission leading to universal good, Bharat’s welfare, and wellbeing of humanity. It is an appeal to all of you to be part of this sacred divine task, in cooperation with the Sangh Swayamsevaks, to carry forward Bharat’s chariot of destiny in order to put Bharatmata at the pedestal of Vishwaguru.",2018-10-18,"Dussehra,Full Text,India,Nagpur,Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,RSS,RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat,TheySaidIt,Urban Naxals,Vijayadashami,Vijayadashami Speech","Mohan Bhagwat Vijayadashami 2018 speech FULL TEXT: RSS chief discusses 2019 elections, Ramjanmabhoomi and 'Urban Naxals'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mohan-bhagwat-vijayadashami-2018-speech-full-text-rss-chief-discusses-2019-elections-ramjanmabhoomi-and-urban-naxals-5401441.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari offered to donate Rs 1,11,100 to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday, but on one condition that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal clears the passage of Delhi Metro Phase IV project caught up on funds issue. The AAP government in Delhi and the BJP-led government at the Centre are at loggerheads over Delhi Metro's Phase IV project which is staring at a possible delay if the matter is not sorted out soon. ""Arvind Kejriwal ji do not punish people like this, who have elected you. The Chief Minister says he will not give Phase IV Metro to Delhi which gave 67 out of 70 (Assembly) seats to him. Brother have your donation, I will give you Rs 1,11,100 from my income through singing if you clear the Phase IV Metro,"" Tiwari tweeted in Hindi. AAP's donation campaign ""Aap Ka Daan, Rashtra Ka Nirman"" was launched by Kejriwal earlier this week, under which monthly donations will be collected from people, in view of coming polls incuding the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

FP Staff,"In what could become a potent weapon for BJP in Karnataka, state water resources minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday admitted that the Congress had made a mistake by advocating for a separate religion tag for the Lingayat community. He said that getting involved in the Lingayat issue that had cropped up a few months before the state's Assembly elections in March was a clear mistake by his government. Some sections of the community had demanded that they be recognised as a religion separate from Hinduism. Shivakumar was speaking at the Dussehra Sammelan of the Rambhapuri seer, Veer Someshwara Shivarcharya Swami in the Gadag district of the state.  , Shivakumar said, ""Our party has made a big mistake in this state. I don't deny it. I always believed, no government should interfere in matters of religion and caste. It was a crime made by our government. Many ministers, leaders spoke about the issue but the verdict of the people in the election is proof that governments should not interfere in these matters. If our government has made a mistake, we ask you for forgiveness."" On 19 March, the then-Congress government had accepted the suggestions of an expert committee under Section 2(D) of the state Minorities Commission Act, ,  The proposal was then sent to the Centre for consideration and a decision is yet to be taken. Lingayats, essentially are   reformer Basavanna who preached against the prevalent caste system in Hinduism. There are also Veerashaivas who follow the teachings of Sri Renukacharya, who believed in Vedas, puranas and the caste system. Veerashaivas and Lingayats, who both worship Shiva, have always been considered one and the same. But there are some who contend they are different. They argue that Veerashaivas are a Shiva-sect of Hinduism, while the Lingayats must be deemed to belong to a different religion. The Lingayats have for long been estimated to constitute up to 17 percent of Karnataka’s population and largely support the BJP, which is cocksure of forming the next government. In light of this fact, the Congress' move to grant the community a separate religion tag was seen as an election gimmick, aimed at wooing a politically important community. The issue was used by the BJP to attack then Siddaramaiah-led government. While the party maintained a cautious stance, keeping away from the move to give Veerashaiva/Lingayat a separate religion status, it accused the Siddaramaiah government of dividing the society to draw political mileage ahead of the last Assembly elections.  ",2018-10-18,"Congress,DK Shivakumar,India,JD(S),Karnataka,Lingayats,NewsTracker,Siddaramaiah","DK Shivakumar seeks forgiveness for Congress' 'interference' in Lingayat issue, says party committed a crime",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/dk-shivakumar-seeks-forgiveness-for-congress-interference-in-lingayat-issue-says-party-committed-a-crime-5403561.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ishfaq Naseem," He was the BJP candidate for the seat of Pahalgam in south Kashmir in the 1996 Assembly elections. Now, years later, Rakesh Koul, a Kashmiri Pandit who lives in the Janipur area of Jammu, has been elected unopposed in one of the wards of the Mattan Municipal Committee. He is hoping to be its chairman after the results for the   (ULB) are announced on 20 October. Two other Kashmiri Pandits have also been elected uncontested to the municipal committee, and Koul is also expecting the support of others in the municipal body. Koul’s win is remarkable, as he migrated to Jammu along with other Hindus after armed militancy erupted in Kashmir in 1989. Though he lives in Jammu, which is at a distance of at least ten hours from Mattan, he said he will try to “carry out development in the area” from which he has won. “ We first migrated to Jammu and later to Delhi. I live in Jammu, but I would work for the development of Mattan area. In Mattan, while three persons were elected unopposed, five others contested on BJP tickets,” he said. Like Koul, there are at least 24 other Kashmiri Pandits from Jammu who have been elected on BJP tickets from Kashmir. On counting day, the migrant voters could seal the fate of many contestants, as in many wards, only 2-3 percent votes were cast. The authorities had allowed Pandits to vote through postal ballots. Rattan Lal Bhan, the chairman of All India Kashmiri Hindu Forum, said that nearly 3 lakh Kashmiri Pandits were eligible for voting in elections to municipal bodies in Kashmir. A large number of migrants registered to cast their ballot. For instance, in the Muthi migrant camp in Jammu, nodal election officer Virender Sathoo said that at least 600 postal ballots were issued. Bhan said that the contesting of Kashmiri Pandits was a step towards the return of the migrants to Kashmir. “ We are Kashmiris and so have a right to vote and contest on the wards in Kashmir,” he said. The voting rights to the Kashmiri Pandits who migrated out of the Valley, however, drew criticism from Kashmir-based political parties, who see this as another ploy by the BJP to control the municipal bodies in the region. In contrast to Jammu, from where the BJP won 25 Assembly seats in the 2014 elections, from Kashmir, it didn’t even win a single seat. But due to the boycott by the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), 80 BJP candidates have been elected unopposed in the urban local body polls, 33 percent of whom are migrant Hindus. BJP’s state general secretary Ashok Koul said that the party fielded at least 35 Kashmiri Pandit candidates on different wards in Kashmir, of whom around 25 have been elected unopposed. “In Srinagar, there is a contest on three seats on which Kashmiri Pandits have filed nominations. Likewise, in other parts, Kashmiri Pandits are in contest with others.” Former minister and senior National Conference leader Ali Mohammad Sagar, however, said, “ These elections are a big sham in the name of democracy. In 2005, when former chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed got the elections conducted, the votes of Kashmiri migrants were in Jammu, which was done through a decision of the state cabinet. But this time, without a cabinet decision or any consultations, the Kashmiri Pandit migrants were made voters for urban local bodies in Kashmir.” He said that it was for the first time that the polling percentage was a mere 3 percent, and remarked, ""How can they carry out development in Kashmir when they have migrated to Jammu?"" Hakeem Yaseen, MLA from Khan Sahib and People’s Democratic Front (PDF) leader, said that Kashmiri Pandit migrants contesting on seats in Kashmir have ""turned the election into a joke."" He said, “Even though previous governments had promised jobs to the migrants in Kashmir, they were not ready to return. How can a candidate who got elected unopposed or on a thin margin work in Kashmir, when the government has been claiming that the security situation is not conducive for the return of migrants?” However, Koul said that the BJP fielded Kashmiri Pandit migrants in Kashmir as their names were registered in urban local bodies in the Valley, and not in Jammu. “Although state subjects can contest from anywhere, a proposer for a candidate has to be a voter from the concerned ward,” he said.",2018-10-18,"Ali Mohammad Sagar,Ashok Koul,BJP,Hakeem Yaseen,Jammu,Jammu And Kashmir,Kashmir,Kashmiri Pandits,Militancy,NC,PDP,PoliticalPlay",Jammu and Kashmir local body polls: At least 25 Pandits from Jammu elected on BJP tickets from Valley,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-local-body-polls-at-least-25-pandits-from-jammu-elected-on-bjp-tickets-from-valley-5405851.html,firstpost,-1,0
Pragya Singh,"Failure to name chief ministerial candidates could leave the Congress defeated even before the whistle blows on the race for power in three states going to the polls over the next two months. An internal party survey in Chhattisgarh, which votes for a new House in two phases on 12 and 20 November, has made clear the Congress’ chances of a victory hinge on its ability to pick a face to lead the campaign and also end factionalism — findings with significance for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan too. Put simply, the party’s problem is that there is more than one leader but no one tall enough to bring the factions together and take on the chief ministers, who are again leading the BJP’s charge in all the three states. Ashok Gehlot is considered “mature” and Sachin Pilot an emerging leader by the cadre, the survey found in Rajasthan. But, party workers also acknowledge there is intense groupism among Gehlot and Pilot loyalists. The cadre insists the two must bury their rivalry to take on the BJP. In fact, this is the Congress’ best chance. Rajasthan, which will vote on 7 December, is notorious for not returning a ruling party while Raman Singh is facing 15-year incumbency in Chhattisgarh. In Madhya Pradesh, where voting will be held on 28 November, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, aiming for a fourth successive term, is battling farmers' anger, corruption charges and widening caste differences over quota benefits. But the Congress is in a fix. A number of regional leaders hold the key to the party winning a state election but at the same time, it has been losing tall regional leaders. Only a strong central leadership will be able to divide the spoils among its satraps in these circumstances. The other big factor is that the Congress is not on a winning streak. If it denies leadership to regional bigwigs, they switch over to rival formations or go on their own. These problems are best illustrated in Chhattisgarh as the survey, commissioned by the Congress to an external agency that also interviewed BJP cadre, found. Out of power for 15 years in the mineral-rich state  the Congress has weakened considerably and Ajit Jogi’s decision to walk out has dealt it a body blow, the survey and interviews with party cadre show. While 24 percent of the cadre backs TS Deo as the chief ministerial face in Chhattisgarh, 20 percent want Bhupesh Bhagel, says the survey findings seen by  . This means the party can’t go into campaign projecting one leader as its risks upsetting the other and his supporters. “Suppose a particular leader is selected as CM face by the party’s decision-makers at the centre and then you find he has lost election... So there is a practical approach here and we need to play a united game,” says a Congress leader. Almost half of the party cadres say the leaders need to set aside their differences and work together to take on the BJP, echoing what the leaders in Delhi say. Over 50 percent of the cadre are “neutral” on who the chief minister should be if the party wins. The decision, they say, should be left to the party president Rahul Gandhi and others in the central leadership. There is a larger pattern here and the Congress has failed to address it. Jogi is not alone. In 2013, Congress split in Andhra Pradesh after a faction loyal to its strongman YS Reddy, who died in a helicopter crash four years earlier, walked out. Reddy’s son Jaganmohan is now the leader of the YSR Congress. In Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma quit the party to join the BJP, which within months formed its first government in the Northeastern state. A Congress leader admits that the “Jogi effect” will harm the Congress in Chhattisgarh but says the problem — inability to pick leaders — is also its strength. Equations in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are such that naming a chief ministerial candidate would lead to intense infighting. So, even if the Congress stands to gain from having a chief ministerial candidate, it will be unable to impose one leader on a state unit. This also reflects the divergent organisational styles of the Congress and the BJP. “We cannot be like the BJP which is cadre-based, and as for surveys, they fall behind the times in the rapidly-evolving situation in each state,” says a Congress leader, who didn’t wish to be identified. What he means is that even in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress will pick a ‘winner’ depending on results. Two other Congress leaders in Delhi point out that not projecting a chief ministerial candidate is part of the high command’s strategy, which it changes whenever necessary.",2018-11-08,"Ajit Jogi,Ashok Gehlot,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Madhya Pradesh,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan,Raman Singh,Sachin Pilot,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Vasundhara Raje","Congress' inability to name CM candidates for Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan polls may cost it dearly",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-inability-to-name-cm-candidates-for-chhattisgarh-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-polls-may-cost-it-dearly-5405951.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Editors,"In Rajasthan’s politics, several sets of castes are like Rudyard Kipling’s East and West— opposite ends that are destined to never meet. This year's Assembly election is likely to yet again showcase the deep fault lines between these communities. In the context of the elections scheduled for December, four castes have acquired importance: Jats, Rajputs, Gurjars, and Meenas. Their interplay and rivalry are coming to the fore as the polling day approaches — best underlined by  , and Meena heavyweight Kirori Lal’s attack on Congress chief Sachin Pilot. Jats and Rajputs have been traditional political rivals in major parts of Rajasthan. Since the two never had a common meeting ground, they generally supported rival political parties in Rajasthan. Traditionally, Jats were considered loyal to the Congress, while Rajputs supported the Opposition — first the Swatantra Party and later the BJP. However, this year, the Jats are weighing several options, one of them being Hanuman Beniwal, a firebrand youth leader from the community who can influence community voters in western Rajasthan. Beniwal is a bit of a maverick with a sharp tongue. In the past, he has fought bitter battles against both the BJP and the Congress. On 29 October, he is slated to hold a show of strength in Jaipur, where he is expected to announce details about his new party and its coalition partners. Both the BJP and the Congress are watching Beniwal with anxiety since his proposed party could be the third force in several parts of the state. To counter his influence, the Congress has made its first move — that of inducting Rajput leader Manvendra Singh. Singh’s family can influence several constituencies in western Rajasthan, where Beniwal is also a force to reckon with, and, thus, make up for the loss of Jat votes in the region. And since the Rajputs are already said to be unhappy with the BJP for their marginalisation, Singh’s entry may further help the Congress hardsell itself to the community. The challenge, of course, would be to ensure the gains from wooing Rajputs are politically much more than the potential loss of Jat votes. In western Rajasthan, where Jats are in sizable numbers and vote en bloc, this may be one of the decisive moves on the poll chessboard. The Congress might be getting ready for a scenario, where mobilisation by a powerful community leads to a counter movement by other communities threatened by the aggressive rise of the former. In this case, the Congress is hoping the rise of Beniwal — and with him, the Jats — would help it bring together Muslims, Rajputs, and Brahmins votes. The other rivalry that seems to be blossoming is that of Gurjars and Meenas, two castes that fight for the same political space in eastern Rajasthan and areas around Jaipur. On Wednesday, Meena strongman Kirori Lal, who recently returned to the BJP, tried to stoke the old rivalry by targetting Pilot, a Gurjar. Kirori asked the Rajasthan Congress chief to clear his stand on the Gurjar demand for inclusion among Scheduled Tribes (STs). Since Meenas are the biggest beneficiaries of the quota benefits extended to STs and Gurjars have been demanding similar benefits, the two communities see each other as rivals. Kirori’s ploy is simple: Raise the fear of a Gurjar chief minister, and mobilise the Meenas against the Congress. As he lost most of his political equity with his frequent flip flops during the past two elections, it is not certain if the Meenas still listen to him. But, Kirori's effort to play the 'Gurjar versus Meena' game will force the Congress to tread with caution. Meenas are not only politically significant in eastern Rajasthan, they are also seen as a martial community that controls voting behavior in villages. Again, like in western Rajasthan, threat of a Meena resurgence can lead to counter polarisation among other castes. How the equations shape up will determine the outcome of the election in the region. Historically, castes have played an important role in Rajasthan’s politics, except in wave elections. Jats and Rajputs voted for the same party for the first time perhaps only in 1989, when Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Chaudhary Devi Lal spearheaded the campaign against the Congress, following an alliance between the BJP and VP Singh’s Janata Dal. In 2013-14, the Narendra Modi wave also demolished the caste barriers and helped the BJP sweep the state. This year, an undercurrent of anti-incumbency is palpable in Rajasthan. If it gathers momentum during the campaign, caste arithmetic may become largely insignificant. If not, it could play a major role. One thing, however, is certain: Hindutva is no longer an issue in the state. Caste is the kingmaker again.",2018-10-18,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Didyouknow,Hanuman Beniwal,Kirori Lal,Kirori Lal Meena,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Sachin Pilot","Caste cauldron in poll-bound Rajasthan: Jats weigh options, Congress ropes in Rajput leader to woo community",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/caste-cauldron-in-poll-bound-rajasthan-jats-weigh-options-congress-ropes-in-rajput-leader-to-woo-community-5405921.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The BJP's central brass is ""seriously looking at"" the leadership issue in Goa to provide a stable government to people, state minister Vijai Sardesai claimed Thursday after meeting party chief Amit Shah in Delhi. Sardesai, whose Goa Forward Party (GFP) is a key constituent of the BJP-led coalition government, met BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday afternoon to discuss the current political situation in the coastal state against the backdrop of the ill-health of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. ""I explained to him (Shah) the aspirations of Goans in the current political scenario. The BJP's central leadership is seriously looking at the leadership issue and to give Goa a stable government. We discussed the political scenario including the aspirations of the Goan people,"" the town and country planning minister told   over the phone from Delhi. Shah had invited leaders of the key constituents of the Manohar Parrikar-led government to Delhi to meet him on Wednesday, but the meeting was rescheduled to Thursday. Shah will meet Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) leader and state minister Sudin Dhavalikar later in the day. The chief minister is away from office for long due to ill health, triggering speculation over the stability of his coalition government. The opposition Congress had claimed the government was in disarray and has become rudderless. The party had also demanded a floor test in the state Legislative Assembly. Shah has already ruled out change of guard in Goa. Parrikar, 62, had gone to the US for treatment of pancreatic ailment earlier this year. He was admitted to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on 15 September. He was shifted to Goa on 14 October and is currently recuperating at his private residence. In the 40-member Goa Assembly, the Parrikar government enjoys the support of 23 MLAs, including 14 of the Bhartiya Janata Party, three each from the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party (MGP), and three Independent legislators.

Press Trust of India,"The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Thursday accused the BJP-RSS combine and Congress of indulging in ""double-talk"" and playing ""dirty games"" over the Sabarimala issue to target the Left government in Kerala by exploiting people's sentiments. The CPI is the second biggest constituent of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala led by the Communist Party of India-Marxist. (CPI-M) CPI national general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy termed the protests in Kerala against the Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women of all ages to the hill shrine as ""very unfortunate"". ""They (agitators) should respect the SC judgement in spite of the sentiment which they may be having (against it),"" Reddy said. ""Gender equality has to be accepted in the 21st century. The old things cannot continue like this,"" he told  . On Wednesday, protesters opposing the apex court order allowing the entry of women of menstrual age group into the shrine turned violent at Nilakkal and clashed with the police, who resorted to baton-charge. Reddy said there was a ""political angle"" vis-a-vis the agitation because Kerala is ruled by a Left front government. The BJP-RSS combine welcomed the judgement at the national level but are opposing it in the state, he said. ""So, this is a dirty game. They want to fight behind communalism. There are many such beliefs among people which are unscientific. This should not continue and the RSS-BJP should not indulge in double talk, one at the Centre and one at the state level,"" he said. If the BJP-RSS have ""got any morality"", they should control their people at the state level and make them withdraw the agitation, he added. On Congress lending its support to the stir, Reddy said the party was behaving in a ""very irresponsible"" manner. ""This is all third-rate type of politics,"" Reddy said adding, the Congress being the main Opposition party in Kerala was ""very irresponsible in behaving like this"". The veteran Communist leader said both the BJP and the Congress were unnecessarily politicising the issue and exploiting the religious sentiments of the people.

Press Trust of India," AMMK leader TTV Dinakran on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the AIADMK leadership, saying the ruling party has ""lost its identity"" and was ""stuck"" due to a ""few selfish"" people. The ousted AIADMK leader also claimed that his Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) would 'retrieve' the ruling party. In an apparent reference to Dinakaran, the AIADMK dubbed him an 'overnight' leader rejected by the people. ""One cannot deny the fact that the party has lost its identity and ideology and veered away from the path laid down by Amma (the late J Jayalalithaa). It is now stuck due to a few selfish persons,"" Dinakaran said without naming anyone. He was apparently targeting AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselavam and the Joint Coordinator K Palaniswami, with whom he is in a running feud for control of the ruling party. Palaniswami is Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu while Panneerselvam is his deputy. In a letter to partymen ahead of the AIADMK founding day on 17 October, Dinakaran said while the late chief minister MG Ramachandran had launched it, Jayalalithaa had taken it forward and made it a popular movement in the state. His jailed aunt VK Sasikala had stood ""solidly"" by Jayalalithaa during her political journey, he said. But post Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, ""hegemonic forces"" had taken over the AIADMK, Dinakaran said in the letter. Reiterating his oft repeated charge of the AIADMK being 'subservient' to the BJP-led government at the Centre, he said his AMMK would retrieve the AIADMK and restore it to its old pride. The AIADMK has ""lost its identity and become someone's slave,"" he said but did not name anyone. Dinakaran claimed 90 percent of AIADMK workers were supporting AMMK and that the rest were in the ruling party due to ""selfish motives."" ""AMMK has been the true AIADMK. In the coming days, it will retrieve AIADMK,"" he added. His victory in the RK Nagar bypoll in December 2017 was proof of people's sentiments as the voters elected him as Jayalalithaa's successor, he said. The bypoll was necessitated due to the death of Jayalalithaa in December 2016. Dinakaran, who contested as an Independent, had defeated ruling party nominee E Madhusudhanan by a good margin. Meanwhile, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami said those who have emerged as ""overnight leaders"" have been rejected by the people. ""Those not aware of Puratchi Thalaivar's political journey and showing no respect for Puratchi Thalaivi's sacrifices, those building castle in the air about coming to power after having emerged as overnight leaders, those who tried to shake our organisation have been thrown away by the people,"" they said in a letter to partymen. AIADMK founder, the late chief minister MG Ramachandran is addressed by supporters as Puratchi Thalaivar, meaning Revolutionary Leader, while his protege Jayalalithaa is Puratchi Thalaivi for them. Those who had ""underestimated"" AIADMK and its supporters were now afraid of it, the two leaders added. AIADMK was a movement that will strive for generations of Tamils, they said, recalling the late Jayalalithaa's words. Paneerselvam had in February 2017 fallen out of favour with then AIADMK interim general secretary Sasikala and resigned as the chief minister. Palaniswami was subsequently made his successor by Sasikala, who also appointed Dhinakaran as AIADMK deputy general secretary, before leaving for Bengaluru to serve a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case. However, in August last year, the factions led by Panneerselvam and Palaniswami merged. Later, a party General Council, under the two leaders, expelled Sasikala from the party and annulled all appointments made by her, including that of Dinakaran.

""The aim of the alliance is to work from a people's angle, to realise the aspirations of martyrs (those who sacrificed life in support of separate Telangana),"" Ramana 
said. ""Though TDP is in Opposition in Telangana for the third time, it is still strong on the back of its cadre strength (with substantial membership),"" he claimed. ""We have (party) committees up to village level. It is only TDP in the state which has such strong network. In the interest of development and seeking a democratic rule in Telangana, we have gone for grand alliance comprising Congress, TDP, CPI and TJS. We will strive for victory and (I have) confidence that (grand alliance) government will come,"" he added. TDP won 15 assembly segments (out of 119) and a Lok Sabha seat in Telangana in the 2014 elections. However, 12 out of the 15 MLAs switched over to ruling TRS which has considerably weakened the party. TDP maintains that its core strength of workers remained intact though leaders have deserted the party. ""The partners of ""grand alliance"" are in talks to clinch a Common Minimum Programme and the seat-sharing among them, he noted.

Press Trust of India,"Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar appointed Prashant Kishor as the party's vice president on Tuesday, effectively making him the second most powerful person in the party over a month after he joined it. Having worked for a number of parties as a poll strategist, Kishor has emerged as a trusted aide to the Bihar chief minister who would count on his relations across party lines and campaign skills to steer the JD(U) to success in the Lok Sabha polls. Party spokesperson KC Tyagi said Kishor's appointment would help it reach out to social segments outside its traditional support base as he counted his skills and past track record as a valuable asset for the Bihar-based party. ""He will help the party chart a new course outside the traditional methods of socialist politics"", Tyagi said. However, the rapid rise of Kishor, who is in his early 40s, is likely to cause heartburn among JD(U)'s senior leaders as Kumar has come to rely increasingly on him for managing the party's political affairs. Kishor was associated with the successful prime ministerial bid of Narendra Modi during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Feeling sidelined, he then worked for the JD(U)-Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress grand alliance in Bihar, which delivered the BJP a humiliating defeat in the 2015 Assembly polls. He consequently worked for the Congress in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. However, Kishor was seen to be warming up to the BJP again with reports that he had met its senior leaders.

FP Staff,"An old Rajasthani saying gives interesting insight into the mind of the state’s voters. Let me first reproduce it in the local language and then offer a translation:   (it is sad that the brother died, but happy that his wife lost her clout/hubris). If you want to understand the upcoming Assembly election in Rajasthan, keep this adage in mind: it explains the psyche of the voter with precision. The mood in the state, as many opinion polls predicting a comfortable lead for the Congress suggest, is of anger against the government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP is set to suffer collateral damage because of the voters' desire to teach local leaders a lesson. There are clear signs of the BJP’s discomfort everywhere: Its headquarters in Jaipur is deserted, the cadre is missing from the ground and central leadership is making every effort to create the impression that apart from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, many other state leaders would be part of the candidate selection process. Two MPs—Arjun Ram Meghwal and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat—have emerged as power centres. There are many theories about Raje’s perceived loss of popularity. One is that she became a victim of the perception that she doesn’t have a good equation with Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. This may or may not be true, but hardcore Modi supporters do not have the kind of trust in her they repose in other BJP chief ministers. The biggest disadvantage of the shadow of doubt—and the resultant uncertainty—that followed the Raje throughout her tenure has been her inability to get things moving on the ground. This led to the perception of Raje being a non-performer. Raje is one of the most dynamic chief ministers within the BJP  She has a mass base, a broad vision and courage. But insecurity and palace intrigue probably kept her distracted for a long time and as a result, governance suffered. Now, even though she is playing like a batsman in the death overs of a T20, there is a limit to what she can put on the scoreboard. Raje’s other problem is her inability to interact freely with party leaders, workers and general public. By temperament and instinct, she trusts only a handful of people in her staff and bureaucracy. But, as is the case with every cabal, people in her inner circle have been motivated more by self-preservation and self-aggrandisement. And since Raje has been cut off from the world, she can't get a feel of the mood on the ground or address grievances. As a result, Raje appears to be facing a wave of anti-incumbency. For a while, the BJP toyed with the idea of projecting an alternative leadership. Some of its leaders argued that had the central leadership taken a decision about the state leadership and stuck to it, the party would have been in a better position ahead of polls. But the BJP was perhaps afraid of letting Raje turn into a martyr or a rebel. With elections just about eight weeks away, the BJP’s only option is to let Raje lead the campaign and hope for the best. Sometimes, a setback is also an opportunity to start afresh. How Rajasthan’s politics evolves after the Assembly election would be interesting to watch. Its electoral history suggests the party that wins the state goes on to dominate the Lok Sabha polls. But this time, voters are getting an opportunity to vent their anger against the BJP five months ahead of Lok Sabha elections. It won’t be surprising if they rediscover their love for Modi after booting out the state government. But here is the thing: Rajasthan’s voters are inherently inclined towards rejecting leaders who they perceive to be proud, arrogant and braggarts. The moment they see signs of arrogance, megalomania and absence of humility, they become impatient to plot the downfall of the high and mighty. And when that happens, no amount of collateral damage deters them: including the pain of the demise of the proverbial  ",2018-10-16,"Amit Shah,Ashok Gehlot,Bhairon Singh Shekhawat,BHAMASHA,BJP,Congress,CP Joshi,Gujjar,InMyOpinion,Jaswant Singh,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Manvendra Singh,Narendra Modi,NewsTracker,OM Mathur,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,PoliticsOnTheGo,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2019,Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje","Rajasthan polls: As Vasundhara Raje grapples with anti-incumbency, BJP hopes for best but braces for backlash",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-as-vasundhara-raje-grapples-with-anti-incumbency-bjp-hopes-for-best-but-braces-for-backlash-5388621.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The Opposition Congress on Tuesday said it will continue its efforts to form an alternate government in Goa despite two of its legislators resigning.  and also from the primary membership of the party. They are set to join the BJP, which is heading a coalition government in the state. The resignations reduced the Congress's strength from 16 to 14 in the 40-member House. However, the Congress put up a brave face, saying the twin resignations were not a setback for the main Opposition party. ""It is not a setback for the Congress. We may have been reduced by two numbers, but our efforts to form the state government will continue,"" Goa Congress spokesperson Nilkant Halarnkar told  . Halarnkar, who is also a legislator, said his party MLAs remain united and there is no possibility of any of them switching sides. ""They (the BJP) have taken two of our MLAs and we will get four from their camp,"" he said, refusing to disclose which MLAs are ready to shift allegiance to the Congress. Last month, the Congress had submitted a memorandum to Governor Mridula Sinha, staking claim to form an alternate government. The Congress had then claimed it has the support of legislators from other parties and can form the government, if given a chance. However, the BJP and allies have been maintaining that the Manohar Parrikar government is stable and will complete its full five-year term. After the resignations, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) held a meeting in Panaji during which the current political situation in the coastal state was discussed. Coming out of the meeting, former chief minister and Congress legislator Pratapsinh Rane said his party will fight back. ""They have left the party but they will have to face by-elections. We will fight it out during the election,"" he told reporters. The Congress had emerged as the single largest party after the 2017 Assembly elections, winning 17 seats. However, within days its number was reduced to 16 when its newly-elected Vishwajit Rane resigned.

Press Trust of India,": Nearly 190 names of suspected Rohingyas have appeared in the voters list and the process of verification and deletion is on, a senior official of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) said Tuesday. ""We have received the list from the Election Commission with nearly 190 names of Rohingyas living in Telangana to be verified. We have sent the list to Returning Officers (RO) and Assistant ROs to verify,"" the official told  . The official said the deletion of such names from the voters list is underway. ""So far, we have deleted 25 names from the voters list. The process is going on. Balance will be done before the second supplement list of voters comes,"" the official said. According to the official, some of the names figured in other constituencies near the city and the list was sent to the respective districts for verification and deletion of names if required. There are as many as 39.60 lakh voters in GHMC limits as per the latest list. There were about 3,600 Rohingyas, who are UNHCR card holders in the city and most of them are illiterates. ""Whoever lives in the camp were not willing to go back as they fear for their lives,"" sources related to the Rohingya camp in old city area had earlier said. ""The names of the Rohingyas have been deleted by obtaining Form 7, (related to the deletion of name from voters list) from them.

Arun Jaitley,"Many young Lawyers practising criminal law used to get an advice early in their career from Veterans in the field. They were told “if you are strong on facts, bang the facts. If you are strong on law, bang the law. If you are weak on both, then bang the desk.” Those who advise Rahul Gandhi appear to have persuaded him that he is cut out only for the third option. Since beating the desk itself would not suffice, it has to be accompanied with a new narrative. If the factual narrative does not suit him then concoct an alternative. Repeat the false narrative a dozen times and convince yourself that falsehood is in fact is the truth. Thereafter, you can comfortably live in self-delusion. Or is it a case of mendacity - The onus now lies on me to substantiate what I have said. Rahul Gandhi’s speeches and tweets display repeated examples of this. I give five examples.  He repeatedly says that a private business house in India has got an advantage ranging from Rs. 38,000 Crore to Rs. 1,30,000 Crore. He further argues that what was to be manufactured by HAL is now being manufactured by a private business house with no experience. THE TRUTH : Rafale aircraft and its weaponry is not being manufactured in India at all, neither by Dassault or by any other private company. All 36 aircrafts and their weapons in a fully flyable and usable form will arrive in India. After the supplies begin Dassault has to make purchases in India for 50% of the contract value. This is as per the UPA’s policy to promote make in India. If the total deal is for Rs. 58,000 Crore, 50% of that amounts to Rs. 29,000 Crore. These supplies to Dassault are to be made by over 120 offset suppliers and which the business house named is one of them. Dassault has said that only 3% of offset may come to that business house which is less than Rs. 1000 Crore.  He repeats congenitally despite being corrected several times that once an account is declared as NPA it amounts to a loan waiver. He then builds a false narrative of the PM having waived the loan of his 15 friends. THE TRUTH : Loans were given during the UPA period. Not a single Rupee has been waived. The Promotors of the defaulting companies have been thrown out through the IBC, and banks are successfully recovering their dues. Through the process of NCLT banks are recovering their loans.  A cliché that he learnt was as to question why mobile phones could not be manufactured in India? I corrected him by mentioning that when UPA went out of power there were only two units manufacturing mobile phones and their accessories. Today there are 120 units and expanding. He then changed his example. He now tells his audiences why footwear are not being manufactured in the district, where he is speaking. Ill-informed as he is, India has become the second largest manufacturer of footwear in the world. Our exports in footwear are about Rs.20,000 crores each year. He just has to take a trip to Bahadurgarh on the outskirts of Delhi to realise the competitive nature of India’s footwear industry.  On GST he mentions that it is flawed and needs to be changed. India has witnessed the most successful implementation of the GST. The country has become one market, all check-points have been abolished, inspectors have disappeared and like Income-tax, the returns are now filed online and most assessments will be online. All States, including Congress ruled States have approved the model and the rates. In the first 13 months, the Congress legacy of 31% tax (Excise + VAT + CST) has been reduced to 18% and 12% in relation to 334 commodities. This has also helped us to check inflation. He seems to be unaware of this. 
 
  Yesterday, while speaking at two different functions in Madhya Pradesh, he made two references to me in each of his speeches. I am annexing clips of his speeches as they appear in the social media. In the first one he says that I have admitted that Vijay Mallya met me in Parliament. He further claims, I have further admitted that Mallya told me that he was escaping to London and that I helped him to escape. He says in his second speech that I have admitted that Nirav Modi also met me in Parliament. He claims that I have admitted that he had a meeting with me and told me that he was going out of the country and I helped him to escape.  I do not recollect ever having even seen Nirav Modi in my life. The question of his meeting me in Parliament does not arise. If he came to Parliament, as Rahul Gandhi claims, then reception records would show that. Where have I admitted all this Mr.Gandhi? As a Member of Parliament, Vijay Mallya once chased me in the corridor of Parliament to discuss his case. I did not pay any heed to him and coldly told him to make his proposal to the bankers. This he says constitutes a meeting where he told me that he was escaping to London. Absolute lie. How does he concoct this falsehood? At the Hindustan Times Summit, he referred to a meeting he had with me and attributed same statements to me. When asked I merely said that ‘I can’t answer hallucinations. I am in the distinguished company of President Macron’. Today I feel it is much more than hallucinations.

Press Trust of India,"Continuing with its campaign against the government over the Rafale deal, the Congress on Sunday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was directly involved in it, adding that he had much to hide about it. Questioning Modi's silence over the deal, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma claimed that only the prime minister was aware that the offset contracts would not be given to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). ""It was his (Modi's) decision. Only he was privy to what he was going to do,"" Sharma said, addressing a press conference at the party office in New Delhi. It was expected that the prime minister would speak on this issue of national importance, but he continued to remain silent while making tall claims about his government, the Congress leader said. ""The prime minister has much to hide in the Rafale deal. His silence raises fundamental questions, because he is directly complicit and personally accountable for it,"" he alleged. Claiming that the Rafale deal was the biggest scam in the history of the country, Sharma reiterated his party's demand for setting up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to look into it.

Debobrat Ghose,"Ahead of the Assembly election in Telangana on 7 December, it's almost certain that Swami Paripoornananda, head of Sree Peetham at Kakinada in East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, will join the BJP. If everything goes well, it may be on 19 October — the Vijayadashami day. Speculations are rife that he may also be the chief ministerial candidate for the BJP in Telangana. A self-proclaimed '  Hindu', Paripoornananda, the author of   – a book on his political ideal Prime Minister Narendra Modi — enjoys a good support of the Hindu population in Telangana. Speaking with  , Paripoornananda shared that his agenda for Telangana would be to fight for the cause of Hindus and their rights, and chalk out a comprehensive development programme for the four-year old state that was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. Edited excerpts from the interview: Yes, the decision of me joining the BJP was taken after having discussions with party president Amit Shah, national general secretary Ram Madhav and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The date has not been finalised yet. After my discussion with them, I had asked for 10 days. I want to devote myself completely during Navratri festival by observing fasting, rituals, doing   and equip myself for the new role. Vijayadashami on 19 October is a very auspicious day and I’m looking at all the possibilities including whether or not I can join on that day. Politics has gradually been decaying over the past several decades. Unless politics is practised with the same devotion as spiritualism, it won’t benefit our state and nation. Sacrifice is the soul of spiritualism as well as politics. As a seer sacrifices everything in life, a political leader needs to do the same. Modi, who’s the custodian of public money of 130 crore Indians, is an example of sacrifice. There’s not a single corruption charge against him and he sacrificed his personal interests for politics. Like Modi's Swachh Bharat mission, there’s an urgent need for   (clean politics). This prompted me to think of joining politics. It won’t affect my spiritual practice, because I’ll follow the path of sacrifice in politics too. Similar to spiritualism, my aim would be ‘to give’ and ‘not take’. It’s true that I have followers from across the social and political spectrum. But I decided to join the BJP because I was inspired by Modi, who’s an icon of true sacrifice in politics. He’s a true visionary, with a missionary zeal and a strong commitment for our culture. While soldiers are sacrificing their lives to protect our borders, politicians have to take up the responsibility to make the nation strong from inside with a sense of sacrifice. It’s only the BJP that can provide a sense of security both to the country and the Hindus. In my book,  on prime minister Modi, I have written that it’s his disciplined personality and commitment that can lead this country and make India a global leader. There can’t be any comparison between Adityanath and me. He’s not only senior to me, but he has been a Member of Parliament for five consecutive terms. He took the responsibility of his constituency Gorakhpur from a young age, and is now heading the Uttar Pradesh government. I have just thought of doing some work in politics and I hope to achieve it with the guidance of people around me, who’re leaders in this field. It’s not about my rating; rather it’ll be the public to respond during the election. You can see the reactions on social media about the state of affairs in Telangana. The Central Government under Modi gave Rs 2.30 lakh crore to Telangana, which is equivalent to three state budgets, but what’s the outcome? It’s time for the people of the state to do political introspection. Amit Shah said in his rally at Karimnagar that KCR government failed to fulfill 150 promises made to the people of Telangana. The present state government used Central funds on self publicity. For a person who believes in true sacrifice — whether for the post of a peon or a chief minister — there can’t be any problem in his chosen work. One needs to have clarity in mind and purity in heart to perform one’s duty. However, it’s all speculation about me being the chief ministerial face for BJP in Telangana. It’s a big challenge and I’m not worried about any position. Whatever responsibility the party assigns me, I will try to accomplish it in the best possible manner. My sole objective is to do good work and establish the party in the state, and it can be possible only by following the mantra of sacrifice. See, I’m a ‘  Hindu’ (staunch Hindu); but that doesn’t mean I discard other religions. I care for all religions and respect their freedom to practise and propagate their beliefs. But it shouldn’t be done at the cost of Hindus. It’s Hinduism that accepts and accommodates all religions and sects, and that’s why other religions could thrive on this land that originally belongs to Hindus. Our commitment is to protect our Constitution and its laws. I visit Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other sections of the society and address their problems. They have shown their acceptance for me. Yes, it’s true. Telangana Police served me with a six-month externment order. We moved court against the order and challenged it. As a result, the Hyderabad High Court rejected my externment order. It was first such incident of my life. I have touched upon every section of the society in the last 25 years and not a single case was registered against me. In my public speech I had talked about Babri Masjid issue and about the foreign invaders like Babur, Mahmud Ghaznavi, Muhammad Ghori, etc, who plundered our country’s wealth and massacred people. Whatever I spoke is part of our history text books taught in schools and colleges. I didn’t speak against any religion or community. This incident made me realise how unsafe and insecure a common Hindu is in his own country. This is also the reason behind my decision to join politics and the BJP. Now the fight is between the ‘sacrificers and swallowers’ in politics. The ‘swallowers’ in politics have exploited people and public money for decades for their own benefit. They neither cared for Hindustan nor for the Hindus. I’m seriously worried and concerned about the  , culture and values of our nation, as there has been a constant attack on these institutions. There’s a need to protect them as there is no place for the Hindus in Hindustan. There are countless cases against Hindu religion in Indian courts including the Supreme Court. BJP’s slogan ‘ ’ – which is, in fact, rooted in the Vedic mantra – ‘ ’ (May all be prosperous and happy) — talks about development. Our focus in Telangana will be overall development, which has been lacking since its formation. A comprehensive development programme needs to be chalked out for Telangana. Let me first join the party and whatever task Modi and Shah assign me, I’ll do. They are my architects and I’ll work according to their guidance. I am just a piece of stone and as sculptors, they will design me properly.  ",2018-11-01,"Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha,Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Development,Hinduism,Hindutan,KCR,Paripoornananda To Join BJP,Swami Paripoornananda,TDP,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018","'No place for Hindus in Hindustan,' claims Swami Paripoornananda, BJP's likely CM face for Telangana polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/no-place-for-hindus-in-hindustan-claims-swami-paripoornananda-bjps-likely-cm-face-for-telangana-polls-5376271.html,firstpost,-1,0

At least 14 female journalists, who had worked with Akbar at newspapers over 15 years ago, accused him of sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement in India.  , Akbar questioned whether there was an agenda in the allegations as they had been made ahead of the 2019 general elections. He also called the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him as ""false, fabricated and deeply distressing"", adding that he will be taking appropriate legal action against the women. ""The allegations of misconduct made against me are false and fabricated, spiced up by innuendo and malice. I could not reply earlier as I was on an official tour abroad,"" he said in the statement. The Congress has repeatedly attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and   since the allegations surfaced against Akbar. ""It is for the prime minister to speak on this issue. Let the country judge its prime minister by his actions. So far, his silence is conspicuous.

Indo-Asian News Service," Goa Forward Party president and agriculture minister Vijai Sardesai on Monday warned against dissolution of the Assembly even as the state chief minister is fighting a serious illness. Goa Forward Party is an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the state government. Sardesai asked the BJP's central leadership, including party President Amit Shah, to ""keep their word"" and ensure continuance of the coalition government in Goa and not go in for dissolution of the Assembly. Sardesai's comments assume significance as Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar remains seriously ill, plunging the state into political uncertainty.

Press Trust of India,"Repeating his 'suit-boot' jibe at Narendra Modi, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged there is no place for the poor in the prime minister's heart, adding, ""If you are not in suit-boot you are not prime minister's bhai"" Rahul also accused Modi of remaining silent when Dalits, women, minorities, tribals and the poor are attacked in the country and alleged that he and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath were trying to save a rape accused BJP MLA in the northern state. On a campaign trail in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, the Congress president again took on Modi over the controversial Rafale jet deal and alleged he had close proximity with businessmen like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi. He also said that loans of farmers will be waived in 10 days if the Congress comes to power in the state. Rahul earlier began his two-day tour of the state by offering prayers at the famous Maa Peetambara Peeth temple complex in Datia in Gwalior division. Taking a swipe at BJP's assurance on women's safety, Rahul, without naming anyone, said there is a ""need to save our daughters from BJP MLAs"". Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, is accused of raping a minor girl in Unnao district. Noting that the Prime Minister had said before the 2014 polls he wanted to be a ""chowkidar"" (guard), Rahul alleged only 15-20 industrialists of the country benefitted under his government, instead of farmers. ""Prime Minister addresses Mehul Choksi as Mehul bhai (brother), Nirav Modi as Nirav bhai and Anil Ambani as Anil bhai but he never addresses a labourer, a poor and a farmer as bhai or hugs them. There is no place for them in his heart.If you are not in suit-boot you are not prime minister's bhai,"" Rahul said addressing a public gathering in Datia. ""The prime minister let jeweller Nirav Modi escape with Rs 35,000 crore, which is equal to the entire budget of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA),"" Rahul further charged. He was referring to the PNB banking fraud allegedly involving Nirav Modi, his uncle Mehul Choksi and others. Taking a dig at the ruling party over the issue of women's safety, Rahul said, ""The BJP gave a good slogan 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' (save and educate daughters). But in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were trying to save a rape accused BJP MLA. The Prime Minister didn't speak a word,"" he alleged. ""There is a need now to save our daughters from BJP MLAs."" ""The Prime Minister could not look me in the eye (during debate in Parliament). The Prime Minister gives speeches but no answers...he doesn't have the courage to reply as to why the contract was snatched from HAL and given to Anil Ambani.""

Press Trust of India," The BJP on Monday accused the Congress of using its leaders to build a momentum against the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, asserting that ""the temple will be built at the Ram's birthplace"". Union minister Prakash Javadekar attacked Congress president Rahul Gandhi, and its leader   that ""no good Hindu"" would have wanted to see the temple built by demolishing a place of worship, a reference to razing down of the Babri mosque in December 1992. ""Ram is the ethos of the nation. People want and have fought for a Ram temple for 500 years after it was destroyed. What Shashi Tharoor is saying must be his and Rahul Gandhi's view that they do not want the temple at Ram's birthplace,"" he said. He said it was astonishing and shocking to hear from Tharoor that a ""real Hindu"" would not wish temple at the Babri mosque site. ""Ram temple will be built only at Ram's birthplace. It is so natural. It was Ram temple which was destroyed and all proofs are before the Supreme Court. BJP wants a magnificent temple at the site,"" he said. The BJP, he added, has already said that it has to happen either through a court verdict, which it is sure will be favourable, or with an agreement between the two parties. The whole nation wants the Ram temple as it is not about the BJP or something political, he said. From north-east to north to south to east and west, everywhere you find Ram as Ram is the ethos of the nation, he said. Earlier at a press conference on Monday, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao, too, accused the Congress of using its leaders to build a momentum against the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and wondered if Rahul is a Hindu or not. He said his party wants an early verdict from the Supreme Court on the Ram temple case but the Congress is trying everything to delay it. Congress leaders had earlier filed plea in the court to delay the matter, he alleged, adding that Tharoor is the latest to join the bandwagon by linking construction of a temple with the ""demolition of disputed structure"" that happened decades back. ""You (Congress) are conspiring to ensure that there is no verdict from the court,"" he said. The Congress is doing ""vote bank politics"", he said, alleging that Rahul had earlier claimed that his party was a ""Muslims party"". Rahul Gandhi wears his ""Shiv bhakti"" (devotion to Lord Shiv) on his sleeve but he should answer whether he is a Hindu or not, Rao said. Speaking at an event in Chennai, Tharoor had said as a Hindu he was very conscious that a vast majority of his fellow Hindus believe that this (the site in Ayodhya) was the specific birth place of Lord Ram. ""And for that reason most good Hindus would want to see a Ram temple at the site where Ram was supposed to be born. But I also believe that no good Hindu would have wanted to see that temple built by demolishing somebody else's place of worship,"" the Kerala MP said. At the press conference, Rao also accused the Congress of following a double-pronged strategy of showing its love for Pakistan and and ""working to break India"" as part of Rahul's ""divisive mindset"". He cited Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu's reported comments that he can relate to Pakistan more than south India to hit out at the Opposition party. He demanded that Sidhu must be sacked as a minister in the Punjab government in a week or the BJP would carry out protests. Sidhu's remarks are also a reflection on the opposition party's and its ruling Gandhi family's ""hatred for south India"", Rao alleged as he cited its ""ill-treatment"" of former prime minister PV Narasimha Rao. It was due to support from south India that the Congress came to power, he said in a reference to its win in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections, claiming that ""otherwise Sonia and Rahul Gandhi would have fled to Italy"". The Congress president should apologise for the alleged poor treatment meted out to Narasimha Rao, he said. ""If you have any shame, at least use his (PV Narasimha Rao's) picture in Telangana,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,": BJP president Amit Shah Monday gave a call to ""uproot"" the Congress from Madhya Pradesh in next month's state Assembly polls to generate a ""tsunami"", the ripple effects of which will be felt in West Bengal and other states currently not ruled by the saffron party. Addressing party workers in Jabalpur in the state, which goes to the polls on 28 November, Shah said winning over 200 of the 230 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh was not enough. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a strong hold over Madhya Pradesh, where it was in power since 2003, and if the Congress was hoping to rule the state, then the opposition party was just engaging in ""daydreaming"". ""Our target is not to cross just 200 seats, but to uproot the Congress from the state to generate a tsunami that will have its effects in states like West Bengal,"" Shah said, addressing the BJP's ""Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot"" convention. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the ""Mera Booth Sabse Mazboot"" (my polling booth the strongest) call to prepare the party cadre for the Assembly polls in five states to be held in November-December. Referring to Congress president Rahul Gandhi's assertion earlier Monday that his party was coming to power in Madhya Pradesh, Shah said he should not indulge in ""daydreaming"". ""After 2014, when Modi became the prime minister of the country, the BJP has emerged victorious in 14 state elections, including in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Goa and Himachal Pradesh. ""Even after losing 14 elections, he (Gandhi) is dreaming of forming government in Madhya Pradesh,"" he said, adding, ""The BJP's grip in Madhya Pradesh is like the feet of Angad (a mythological character in the Ramayana)."" According to the Hindu epic, nobody was able to lift the feet of Angad in the court of Ravana. Referring to the BJP's progress since its formation in 1980, Shah said the party now had over 1,800 MLAs and 330 MPs, including those in the Rajya Sabha, and headed a government at the Centre that enjoyed full majority. ""But this is not the high point for the BJP. It will be in the apex position only when it wins Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, among other states,"" he added. Shah said after the Modi government came to power, India carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) to give Pakistan a befitting reply for a terrorist attack on Indian jawans. He criticised Gandhi for stating that the BJP was trading in the blood of soldiers by taking credit for the September, 2016 Army operation. 
India was the only country in the world after the US and Israel to carry out surgical strikes, Shah said. Talking about the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, he sought to know whether illegal immigrants should be deported from the country or not. Because of the illegal immigrants, unemployment was rising in the country, the BJP chief said, while calling them ""termites"" who indulged in terror activities.

The Congress lawmakers had earlier said that they would be joining BJP after meeting party chief Amit Shah in Delhi. The development comes in after Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar returned to the state on Sunday.

Prior to the resignations of Sopte and Shirodkar, the Congress was the single largest party in the 40-member state Assembly with 16 MLAs. Whereas the Parrikar government has the support of 23 MLAs comprising 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party as well as three Independents. Goa is currently witnessing hectic political activities with Congress party petitioning President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking his intervention to ask Goa Governor Mridula Sinha to call them to form the government.

Press Trust of India,": Union minister Ramdas Athawale Sunday said that he had devised a formula to satisfy bickering allies BJP and Shiv Sena which involved splitting the tenure of chief ministership in Maharashtra equally between the two parties. He said that he would discuss this proposal with leaders of the Sena and the BJP, allies in the Maharashtra and Union governments. ""The formula of the party with the maximum number of seats getting the Chief Minister's post is already there but I am going to discuss this new formula (splitting the CM's tenure) with leaders of both the parties,"" Athawale said. The two parties have been at loggerheads over several issues and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has said that his party would fight all future polls alone. The BJP, on the other hand, has said that it wanted an alliance with the Sena but was willing to fight on its own if an agreement was not reached. The Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment also staked claim to the Mumbai South Central Lok Sabha seat currently held by Sena's Rahul Shewale. ""If the BJP and Sena form an alliance for the 2019 general elections, I will ask Sena to leave Mumbai South Central constituency for me and, in return, I will convince the BJP to leave Palghar seat for Sena,"" he said.

Sreemoy Talukdar,"The idiom ‘lost in translation’ refers to the true meaning, subtlety or nuance of words that goes missing or is misinterpreted when translated from one language to another. Director Sofia Coppola used it as the title for her romantic comedy in 2003, starring Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray. Movies are wonderful illusions weaved out of facts, fiction and craft. Congress president Rahul Gandhi is busy directing his own movie to entertain voters in the upcoming elections. And between the French written word and its English translation, he has chanced upon enough illusion in the script to weave a gripping narrative. “Narendra Modi is corrupt,” thundered the Congress president on Thursday, repeating a charge that he has levelled often in the past. “He must resign,” said Gandhi in a flourish of righteous indignation. The dynast was on a roll.   (watchman) of industrialist Anil Ambani and told reporters in a news conference that in order to “save Ambani’s debt-ridden business”, Modi has “taken Rs 30,000 crore from IAF and put it in Ambani’s pocket.”  the prime minister’s silence on the issue, suggested that the Union defence minister has “rushed to France” to engineer a “cover-up”, called for an “investigation” into the issue, and for good measure, added that even an “ex-President of France — no less has said India’s prime minister is corrupt”. It is not clear which former French president had called prime minister Modi “corrupt”. Rahul didn’t bother to furnish any data. He also might not be aware that Nirmala Sitharaman did not actually “rush” to France. Her visit, in fact, was delayed.   her French counterpart Florence Parly on 17 September but had to defer the trip reportedly due to “scheduling issues”. It is a daft thing to drag heads of other states into Indian domestic politics, dafter still to come unprepared to news conferences. However, coming from Rahul, it is not really surprising. The Gandhi dynast doesn’t believe in responsible politics and has little regard for facts or data. He wants to do a VP Singh on Modi but his entire Rafale script rests on a game of smoke and mirrors where illusions and perception shape the narrative. Rahul’s latest salvo against the prime minister is based on a report published in French media which purportedly “proves” that Dassault Aviation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of Rafale fighter jets, was “under pressure” to take Anil Ambani’s Reliance on board as its offset partner. If true, this seemingly corroborates former French president Francois Hollande’s original statement (from which he later backtracked) that Indian government “proposed” Reliance’s name. The report, published in French portal  , refers to a document where Dassault deputy CEO Loïk Segalen is quoted as informing his staff members in May 2017 that Dassault’s joint venture with Ambani’s Reliance group (called Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd, or DRAL) for discharging offsets in the Rafale deal was a “precondition"". It was apparently “imperative and obligatory” for the jet manufacturing firm to win the 36-aircraft deal. Rahul wasted no time in referring to the report and concluded that this “ .” Dassault is obligated under French law to explain to its workers’ union why it was shifting its production of Falcon business jets to Nagpur in India under joint venture DRAL instead of creating jobs for French labourers.   as “counterpartie” or “counterpart” in the French document, as Sujan Dutta points out in his piece. However, Dassault’s CEO Eric Trappier has clarified in an interview with news agency   that the document refers to India’s “offset clause” and shifting of a part of the work to India as “mandatory” part of the 36 aircraft deal, and nowhere, he claims, has Loïk Segalen said that the company was obligated to take Reliance on board. The company owed an explanation to its workers why the deal won’t yield as many jobs as labour unions would have hoped, and cited the offset contract under India’s Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) as the reason.  over the French word   which Rahul took as concrete proof of Modi’s corruption, Trappier said: “what is called “offset” in English is usually translated into French as “compensation” or “contrepartie”. The reference is the contract we signed and which is called “Offset contract”. With regard to the staff and trades unions organisations, Dassault Aviation uses the term “obligation contractuelle d’offset” or “obligation contractuelle de compensation ”. The Dassault Aviation CEO reiterated that the company was under no pressure from anyone to choose Reliance as a joint venture partner. He also clarified that DRAL has only 10 percent offset in Rafale and Reliance is one among 100 firms with whom Dassault is negotiating to discharge its offset obligations, including around 30 with which the company has already confirmed partnerships. “Signing an offset contract is a requirement of Indian law (Defence Procurement Procedure). The implementation of offsets is an obligation and, under the Indian regulation, the choice of the partners belongs to us. In full compliance with this regulation, Dassault Aviation therefore decided to set up the DRAL joint venture with Reliance and build a plant in Nagpur, which should enable us to meet about 10% of these offset obligations. We are in negotiations with about a hundred Indian companies and partnerships have already been concluded with about thirty of them,” he said in the interview. The company,  , has repeated that Dassault Aviation “has freely chosen to make a partnership with India’s Reliance Group” and “other partnerships have been signed with other companies such as BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic, Mahindra, Maini, SAMTEL.” Theoretically, it is possible, as the Congress president has claimed, that Dassault is “lying” under pressure from the Indian government because it wants to safeguard the deal. That potential conflict of interest, however, won’t apply in case of independent actors such as Julien Boussiou, the South Asia correspondent of French newspaper  , whose interpretation of the purported   document (which Rahul has cited to attack Modi) matches that of Dassault CEO Trappier’s contention. In a series of tweets since the latest controversy broke out, Boussiou has pointed out that “in may 2017, Dassault Informed French trade unions about the construction of a plant in Nagpur, and explained to them why that plant could not be built in France. (because of the offset).” Incidentally, France president Emmanuel Macron is under tremendous pressure due to a slowdown in the economy and high unemployment rate. The French economy has recorded a 1.6 percent growth this year, the lowest in Europe. The unemployment rate stands at 9.1 percent; two of Macron’s cabinet colleagues have “abruptly”   has tumbled to “29% in September from 50% at the start of the year.” It is not inconceivable that right at this juncture, the French government will be under intense media scrutiny for lack of jobs, and susceptible to charges that it cut a bad deal that requires jobs to be transferred out of France. This ties all the loose ends lends an entirely different perspective to the controversy. We now see that the motivation behind French media activism might be related more to French domestic politics. Also, the different interpretations of the word   (by an independent source) demolishes Congress narrative and strengthens the government’s position that it never suggested Reliance’s name to Dassault. As has been noted earlier, between the written French word and its English translation, Rahul found enough space to peddle his propaganda on the deal, but campaigns based on obfuscations and surmises eventually become unsustainable bar the rhetoric. Not for the first time has the Congress president been found wanting in facts. His main charge against the Modi government is one of cronyism. He has attempted to prove that Modi has helped his “pal”   (the actual offset contract bagged by Reliance is much lower.) While the Gandhi scion has been unable to prove his charge or make a convincing case on Rafale,   that “projects worth Rs 100,000 crore were awarded to Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group during the last seven years of the Congress-led UPA government.” Time will tell whether Gandhi’s gamble will work.

Press Trust of India," The Congress on Friday hit back at the BJP over its ""serial liar"" barb at Rahul Gandhi, saying it should give factual answers to questions asked about the Rafale deal and then the country will decide who is lying and who is not. The Congress and the BJP have been involved in a war of words over the Rs 58,000 crore deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France, with claims and counter-claims flying thick and fast. Union minister Piyush Goyal on Friday alleged the Congress president was a ""serial liar"" and ""manufacturer of fake news"" and his repeated lies cannot substitute the truth of the deal.

Press Trust of India," BJP president Amit Shah on Friday asked the party workers to create an environment for a ""massive wave"" in the favour of the saffron party in November's Chhattisgarh Assembly polls so that it will turn into a ""tsunami"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He said the government would identify the ""infiltrators"" and throw them out of the country after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retained power in 2019's general election. Shah told the party workers that a thumping victory for the BJP in Chhattisgarh would avenge the ""sacrifices"" of their fellow workers in other states. He was referring to the killings of party leaders and workers in Kerala, West Bengal and other non-BJP-ruled states. Addressing the booth-level BJP workers in Bilaspur town, Shah also hit out at the Congress, accusing it of engaging in the politics of appeasement for votes and doing nothing against ""infiltrators"" who were like ""termites"". ""The BJP is in power in 19 states, covering about 70 percent area of the country. After being in power for three consecutive terms, we are in the battleground to form government for the fourth time in Chhattisgarh,"" he said. Shah asked the BJP workers to set their eyes on winning over 65 of the 90 Assembly seats in Chhattisgarh (the saffron party's tally was 49 in 2013), which will go to the polls in two phases — on 12 and 20 November. ""I want to ask, are you going to be satisfied with a victory margin of two-three seats? This time we should win more than 65 seats.

""My workers in Bengal are keeping an eye on Chhattisgarh. If you win this election with a thin majority, the workers all over the country will be disappointed,"" the BJP chief said. ""Our workers are being killed in Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. Chhattisgarh's victory will form a base for forming governments in Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana. ""Create a massive wave in the state, which will turn into a tsunami in 2019 in the country to ensure victory for (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji,"" he said. Shah said the Chhattisgarh poll results will have a bearing on national politics in 2019. ""(A BJP) victory in Chhattisgarh will lay the foundation for a grand win in 2019.

Press Trust of India," In a clear reference to cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the presence of terror infrastructure and state support to terrorists in the immediate neighbourhood are constantly testing India's patience, and New Delhi was exercising great restraint in dealing with it. In an address at the Institute of Strategic Research in Paris, she said concerted efforts are required to choke financing and supply of arms to the terror groups besides disrupting the recruitment and mobilisation of ""foreign terrorists"". She said both India and France have been victims of terrorism and that the French government was playing a unique role in combating the menace. The defence minister arrived in Paris on Thursday on a three-day visit with an aim to further bolster India-French strategic ties. She made a special mention about the continued presence of terrorist infrastructure and state support to terrorists in the immediate neighbourhood and that they are constantly testing India's patience, according to a release issued by India's defence ministry. Sitharaman said the current international security environment can be characterised as one of rapid change and uncertainty, with swathes of sustained instability and violence posing a grave challenge. ""The persisting threat of terrorism, or what we in India as well as increasingly in Afghanistan too, more accurately refer to as cross-border terrorism, is a primary security threat,"" she said. She also said that the interplay between ""states and non-state actors"", that are often used as proxies to foment violence, has been having severe consequences. Sitharaman said areas of continued violence and instability in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, as well as parts of West Asia and Africa, have functioned as incubators of virulent manifestations of terrorism. This, she said, combined with the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and uncontrolled migration now pose a clear threat to the stability of wider Asia and Europe. Delivering her lecture on ""India-France Defence Engagement in a Multipolar World"", Sitharaman said her visit to Paris is a reaffirmation of India's commitment to the strategic partnership with France, especially in the critical areas of defence cooperation. ""Under the new framework for the defence industry in India, we are hoping to meet our defence requirements within a framework of joint manufacturing and technology-driven partnerships,"" she said. Sitharaman said India presents a major opportunity for the French defence industry and that Indian government's 'Make-in-India' initiative opens doors for third country exports. She also talked about the growing India-France maritime cooperation, especially in the Indian Ocean region. The defence minister said such cooperation will be crucial in order to preserve the strategic interests and in maintaining the safety of international sea lanes for unimpeded commerce and communications in accordance with international law. ""India has been constantly supportive of recent efforts to bring about peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and diplomacy. ""Developments in West Asia are of great significance for India. India has key stakes in this region, which accounts for 66 per cent of our energy requirements and is home to over eight million Indians,"" she said.

In the recently concluded two-day national executive in Jaipur under a newly-appointed team of office bearers, the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) — the youth wing and one of the key frontal organisations of the Congress party — has chalked out a comprehensive strategy to implement the decisions which were taken under the guidance of Congress president Rahul Gandhi during the meet. The national president of IYC, Keshav Chand Yadav, who had also been its general secretary, spoke to   about the plans and programme of the youth wing. Three resolutions were passed in the national executive. First, steps are to be taken to safeguard our nation’s constitutional values and maintain social and communal harmony. The steps taken by the BJP-led governments – whether at the Centre or in the states—have been undemocratic, anti-national and created fissures among religious and social communities. Second, keeping the forthcoming elections in mind, the IYC will visit every nook and corner of the country including villages, and ask people whether the promises made by Narendra Modi government have been fulfilled or not, vis-à-vis what the Congress would do if it came to power. We’re doing this through our nationwide door-to-door campaign — ‘ ’. And third, at the organisational level, we’ll have discussions and dialogues on the ideological battle between the BJP-RSS combine and the Congress. We’ll carry forward the message to the public about the false promises and lies spread by the Modi government and the BJP-RSS. It’s not just in India that such things are happening; many countries have been facing a similar kind of situation, where the governments are resorting to lies. An example is US president Donald Trump. This is a dangerous trend, which needs to be exposed, and we’ll do it. Unless development takes place in the real sense, people will protest, and those voices can’t be suppressed. Without real development, talking about world peace is meaningless. While addressing the national executive, Rahul   emphasised on strengthening the organisational structure by creating a conducive environment within the organisation, and through hard work. He said that hard work won’t go unrewarded. We’re working on a plan related to our work, funding, reaching out to masses, disseminating the party’s core ideology and values, etc. Due to the lies being spread by the BJP and RSS-affiliated students’ body Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, democratic values across campuses are ending. This kind of social change is a matter of great concern. Our students’ wing—National Students’ Union of India — is working towards keeping values alive by organising seminars, symposia, meets, etc. There can’t be any comparison between us and the BJP’s youth wing, as the latter thrives on spreading hatred, lies and polarisation of the society on communal lines. Following the footsteps of the BJP, their youth wing is working completely in a reverse direction. The IYC, in coordination with youth wings of 14 major national and regional political parties under the umbrella of United Youth Front (UYF), organised a massive national protest rally ‘ ’ (Save Nation, Save Youth) in Delhi on 8 October. It was against the authoritarian Modi-led NDA government. In future too, whenever the need arises, UYF — a collective political platform of the youth — will hold rallies and protest agitations in the country. Youth have begun to respond to the Congress, after seeing the four-year rule of the BJP-led government at the Centre. During the Karnataka Assembly election, our vote share increased from 36 percent to 37 percent. It’s the youth who have been able to realise the ground situation in the country at present. Growing unemployment is one of the key issues bothering them. The Youth Congress will go among them and tell them the truth, and discuss our roadmap with them. The period of one-and-half months before Assembly elections this year in five states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram will be crucial for us. Besides strengthening our organisation up to the block and village level, we’ll strongly emphasise on our ‘ ’, reach out to voters and tell them what changes Congress want to initiate and expose the BJP government on issues like the Rafale deal scam, exorbitant rise in fuel prices, atrocities against women, Dalits and minorities, BJP-sponsored crimes, communal violence, unemployment, inflation, and false promises made by Modi. IYC will expand its support base and ensure mobilisation up to the booth level. Immediately after state polls, we’ll work out a larger programme for the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",2018-10-12,"ABVP,BJP,Congress,Fuel Prices,Indian Youth Congress,Keshav Chand Yadav,Rafale Deal,Rahul Gandhi,TheySaidIt","ABVP's lies are eroding democratic values across campuses, says Indian Youth Congress chief Keshav Chand Yadav",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/abvps-lies-are-eroding-democratic-values-across-campuses-says-indian-youth-congress-chief-keshav-chand-yadav-5368611.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Voting is underway for the third phase of Jammu and Kashmir local body polls, but there is little hope of any change in the trend of low voter turnout in the Valley as most of the wards fall in the separatist hotbed of downtown Srinagar and south Kashmir. The polling for the third phase started at around 6.05 am in all the 4 districts after the mock poll was conducted. Of the 40 wards going to polls on Saturday, 20 fall in Srinagar city's downtown area, where the voter turnout has been generally low since the eruption of militancy in the state in 1989. The wards in downtown Srinagar going to polls are Khanqah-e-Mualla, Maharajgunj, Jamia Masjid, Makhdoom Sahib, Khwaja Bazaar, Aqilmir Khanyar, Rozabal, Daulatabad, Islamyarbal, Nawab Bazaar, Nawa Kadal, Safakadal, Rathpora, Edigah, Palpora and Tarabal. Ten other wards in the civil lines area of the city, where polling will be held on Saturday, are Lal Chowk, Rajbagh, Ikhrajpora, Mehjoor Nagar, Natipora, Chanapora, Budshah Nagar, Baghat Barzulla, Hyderpora and Rawalpora. The voter turnout, however, is expected to be high in 13 wards in the Uri area of north Kashmir's Baramulla district, which has traditionally been a high polling area. A similar trend might be seen in seven wards in the Mattan area of Anantnag district, which has a significant Kashmiri migrant population. Although 207 wards in the state were scheduled to go to polls in the third phase, polling is being held only in 96 wards — 56 in Samba district in Jammu division and 40 in the Valley. Of the remaining 111, candidates were elected unopposed on 49 wards, while no one came forward to contest polls in 62 wards —  mostly falling in Pulwama and Anantnag district of south Kashmir. As many as 365 candidates are in the fray — 242 for four municipal bodies in Samba district and 123 for Valley's four municipal bodies. The polling will conclude at 4 pm, officials said. Preparations for polling have in full swing. According to officials, a thick security blanket has been thrown around the polling stations, while security forces have been carrying out area domination exercises over the past couple of days for ensuring incident-free election. The National Conference, the PDP and the CPM have boycotted the polls due to the legal challenge to Article 35-A of the Constitution in the Supreme Court.

Ajaz Ashraf,"Political pundits will have us believe that the Congress' failure to stitch a broad alliance of Opposition parties will render difficult its task of winning the forthcoming Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. In case the Congress is unable to win at least two out these three states, they say, it would besmirch the leadership credentials of its president, Rahul Gandhi, and raise serious doubts about his ability to cobble together an Opposition front to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Such a dire analysis ignores the real significance that the Assembly elections have for the Opposition parties — it is their last chance to gauge the relative strength of each other before they enter into negotiations to craft an electoral alliance against the BJP for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Viewed from this perspective, the Congress' decision to go solo in the three states is paradoxically conducive for Opposition unity. As of now, there are three basic drivers of Opposition politics. One is the belief that anti-incumbency has set in against the Modi government. Its strength, though, is debatable, which brings into play the second driver — the best possibility of dislodging the Modi government in 2019 is through an alliance in every state. Which party gets how many seats will depend on its proven electoral strength, which is also the third driver of Opposition politics. Barring two parties, the Opposition is a medley of regional outfits that have a footprint in just one state. One of the two exceptions is the Congress, which, regardless of having shrunk, commands a national identity and pockets of influence countrywide. The other is the Bahujan Samaj Party — it is a significant player in Uttar Pradesh and also boasts of a sizeable vote share in several states, including Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, where it can become a factor behind a party failing to win. The BSP’s strength lies in its ability to pull in the votes of Dalits, who, like Brahmins, are a social group with a pan-India presence. On paper at least, a Congress-BSP alliance could have been formidable in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. For such an alliance to fructify, it was imperative for the BSP to make a demand for reasonable number of seats. This is because the three states are just a few in which the Congress can hope to win on its own. Regardless of losing them over the last 15 years, its hope in the three states continues to kindle because the electoral contests there are bipolar. Consequently, the Congress will not want a third party to emerge in the three states to undermine its future prospects there. Once relegated to the third spot, the Congress tends to slip into some kind of terminal decline. Think Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. But BSP leader Mayawati, quite clearly, sought to exploit the Congress' desperation for significant victories before the 2019 polls to reverse the decline of her own party. In Madhya Pradesh, the party’s vote share dropped from 8.97 percent in 2008 to 6.29 percent in 2013. In Rajasthan, it vote share declined from 7.6 percent in 2009 to 3.37 percent in 2013. In Chhattisgarh, the BSP’s 6.11 percent of votes in 2008 was halved five years later. For sure, BSP votes are concentrated in certain pockets that give it a heft — for instance, in Matsya region of Rajasthan and Bundelkhand area in Madhya Pradesh. Yet this factor alone cannot justify Mayawati’s demand for seats that were palpably disproportionate to her party’s vote share. For instance, she is said to have demanded 50 seats in Madhya Pradesh on the basis of the 2013 vote share of 6.29 percent. This was an unreasonable demand because there was nothing to suggest an upswing in the BSP’s fortunes in Madhya Pradesh since 2013. True, the Dalits of Madhya Pradesh have been assertive in recent months, as evinced during the 2 April bandh against the Supreme Court judgement diluting the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In fact, Mayawati’s demand for seats was an attempt at crafting a win-win situation for herself. Had the Congress aligned with the BSP and given her even half or 20 the 50 seats she demanded in Madhya Pradesh, a victory for the alliance would have been credited to the BSP. A share in power would have overnight consolidated her Dalit vote bank as it happened in Uttar Pradesh in the decade following the demolition of the Babri Masjid. In such a scenario, the BSP could well have become the 'third front' in Madhya Pradesh and, more significantly, erode the Dalit base of the Congress. It could have consequently made the Congress dependent on the BSP for 2019 — and even beyond. After having been turfed out from one state after another, the Congress will be chary that it should, for uncertain gains of today, weaken itself in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh for all times to come. Another significant factor behind the Congress’ decision not to concede to Mayawati’s demand was the findings of its internal survey. It conclusively showed that the BSP is no longer a player in Madhya Pradesh. The Congress feels more apprehensive of Jai Adivasi Yuva Sangathan, Gondwana Gantantra Party, and SAPAKS (Samanya Pichhda Varg Alpsankhyak Karmachari Sangathan) Samaj Party, a bunch of anti-reservationists, chipping away at its votes than what it thinks the BSP can. In a way then, Mayawati’s demand for seats from the Congress was deliberately designed to fail. Her logic seems to have been that should the Congress fail to win Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan or even one of them, she can go to town, as will political pundits and psephologists, pointing to what the verdict could have been had the Congress and the BSP tied up. Only then will the Congress come under pressure before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to align with the BSP in states where it has a single-digit vote share. In other words, Mayawati did not wish to make it easy for the Congress to win without enhancing her gains. A weak Congress provides her scope to expand her Dalit base outside of Uttar Pradesh in the long run. Unreasonable demands dashed the possibility of an alliance and provided her the opportunity to blame the Congress for being communalist and casteist. Likewise, the Congress did not concede to Mayawati’s demands because it would have conveyed the impression that it lacks the confidence to win on its own. On the other hand, should it win Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh on its own, it will enhance its bargaining power in negotiations for seats before the 2019 elections. More significantly, it will also enable the Congress to become the glue for Opposition unity and provide a national perspective to an alliance largely comprising regional outfits. Whether or not the Congress performs well in the Assembly elections, the failure of the Opposition to unite in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will make the business of forming an anti-BJP alliance less messy in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats in 2014. A Congress-BSP alliance in the three states, and possible victories as a consequence, could have had made the two parties mount pressure on Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav into giving a larger share of seats to them. This possibility has receded for the time being. It will recede even further in case the Congress performs well in the forthcoming Assembly elections. Mayawati will then have to redefine her ambitions — and concentrate on keeping the Congress out of Uttar Pradesh, where her fortunes have been on the downswing since 2008. It will push both Yadav and Mayawati to stick together. Regardless of what the pundits say, the Congress’ decision not to have an alliance in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will clarify to it and others its own strength and consequently facilitate Opposition unity, not diminish its possibility.",2018-10-26,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,Anti-Incumbency,Assembly Election 2018,Bahujan Samaj Party,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Grand Opposition Alliance,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Opposition Alliance,PoliticsDecoder,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Samajwadi Party,Uttar Pradesh","Congress' decision to go solo in upcoming Assembly polls will help party ascertain its position, size up likely allies for 2019",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-decision-to-go-solo-in-upcoming-assembly-polls-will-help-party-ascertain-its-position-size-up-likely-allies-for-2019-5372171.html,firstpost,-1,0
Kangkan Acharyya,"While the Aam Aadmi Party has termed the recent income tax raids on premises linked to Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot as a conspiracy, it now faces the challenge of answering questions raised by former AAP member and whistleblower Neil Terrance Haslam. Haslam backs the income tax department's stand that the raids were conducted to investigate the routing of black money by companies run by the minister’s family. He also said that recently, he had filed a complaint with the income tax department in this regard, after which the raids took place The whistleblower had earlier alleged that the AAP had received Rs 2 crores as donations through shell companies. Gahlot did not respond to multiple attempts by   to contact him to seek his response. The income tax department on Wednesday launched a 24 hour-long raid at 16 premises connected to Gahlot.   that the searches were being conducted as a part of a probe against two firms — Brisk Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd and Corporate International Financial Services Limited — linked to the minister As per records with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Corporate International Financial Services Limited is a non-banking financial corporation. Haslam alleges that a big chunk of funds of this company came from dubious companies, and the money was routed to the companies owned by Gahlot and his family as unsecured loans. It is a known norm that a bank or a non-banking financial corporation is not expected to lend money without adequate collateral. However, according to Haslam, this norm was not followed by Corporate International Financial Services Limited while handing out loans worth Rs 57.23 crores to the minister's family members and companies. He said, “Kailash Gahlot and his family own 18 to 19 companies. If we analyse the balance sheet of Corporate International Financial Services Limited, we will see that from the financial year 2010-11 to 2014-15, unsecured loans were given to these companies and members of Gahlot's family. Can Gahlot explain why unsecured loans of such big amounts were handed out by the company?"" According to the complaint submitted by Haslam to the income tax department, the company lent Rs 7.66 crore to 11 companies and individuals in 2010-11, and Rs 31.62 crore to 13 entities in 2011-12. In 2012-13, the company is said to have given unsecured loans worth Rs 35.38 crore to 13 entities. In 2013-14 and 2014-15, it is said to have given unsecured loans worth Rs 47 crore and Rs 57.23 crore to 15 and 14 companies respectively. Gahlot's name appears as one of the recipients of the unsecured loans in the last four financial years. According to Haslam's complaint, the minister received Rs 1.25 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 2.94 crore in 2012-13. The corresponding amounts in 2013-14 and 2014-15 are Rs 3.62 crore and Rs 1.34 crore respectively. Haslam alleged that a part of the money paid to the companies as unsecured loans came from shell companies, as proceeds received from sale of equity shares, which existed only on paper. He further claimed that the unsecured loans were handed out to legitimise black money. He said, “The company's balance sheet shows that in 2011 and 2012, it sold equity shares worth Rs 32 crores to these companies. To legitimise black money, these were shown as unsecured loans to the companies linked to Gahlot and individuals related to the same family.” The complaint further claims that in 2011, the company sold 1,98,900 shares to a number of companies at the rate of Rs 990. In 2012, 22,730 shares were said to have been sold to these companies. Similarly, Brisk Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd allegedly transferred Rs 6.22 crores to the personal account of Kailash Gahlot and his wife. Haslam alleged this was done to route black money garnered through selling of large number of shares to Gahlot's family and close associates. He also expressed suspicion that Corporate International Financial Services Limited fudged rent figures to evade tax. “The company has never shifted from its address — House No A-14 Masoodpur, Opposite Chopal, New Delhi — and yet, rent has quadrupled in six years starting from 2011. This is quite abnormal,” he said. He further explained, “The amount of rent paid for the official premises has a direct bearing on the profits earned by a company in a year. The more the rent, the less is the profit, and also the tax. An abnormal increase in rent in a span of six years smacks of attempts to evade tax.” Ashok Agarwal, an advocate in the Delhi High Court, says that as per the prevailing law in Delhi, a landlord is entitled to an increase of rent by 10 percent every year. However, this is often decided through mutual understanding between the tenant and the landlord. “There is no law which bars a landlord from increasing rent exorbitantly if the tenant is ready to pay such an amount. Often, with the help of this loophole, it is possible for a person or a company to fudge the documents related to payment of rent,” he added. At a press conference called after I-T sleuths raided 16 properties with links to Gahlot,   alleged that the Centre was blatantly using internal agencies such as the I-T department, Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Delhi Police to intimidate AAP. However, Haslam said, ""The AAP should understand that such tactics are not going to work anymore. The party should answer the questions raised in my complaint.",2018-10-13,"Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,Brisk Infrastructure And Developers Pvt Ltd,ConnectTheDots,Corporate International Financial Services Limited,Delhi,Income Tax,Kailash Gahlot,Neil Terrance Haslam",I-T raids on Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot: Ex-AAP member Neil Terrance Haslam backs charges of financial misappropriation,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/i-t-raids-on-delhi-minister-kailash-gahlot-ex-aap-member-neil-terrance-haslam-backs-charges-of-financial-misappropriation-5374361.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," NCP chief Sharad Pawar has predicted that the BJP and the Shiv Sena may come together for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, but not for the Assembly polls in Maharashtra. Talking to reporters in Mumbai on Friday night, Pawar also ruled out the possibility of the two elections being held simultaneously, saying the ""situation has changed"". The Centre has been toying with the idea of holding simultaneous elections for quite some time now. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for ""widespread"" debate on holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies saying it would result in financial savings. ""The BJP and the Shiv Sena may join hands for the Lok Sabha elections, but may not come together for the state Assembly polls,"" Pawar said. The BJP and the Shiv Sena, have been in a strained relationship despite sharing power at the Centre and the state. The Shiv Sena has already announced that it would go solo for the polls. The BJP, on the other hand, is eyeing to forge an alliance with the Sena for the upcoming elections. Questioning the credibility of EVMs, the NCP supremo called for the use of ballot papers in the polls. He said the Opposition parties may meet within 15 days to discuss the issue. Pawar reiterated his demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the alleged Rafale scam. He recalled how the BJP, while in the opposition in the 1980s, had demanded a JPC to probe into the alleged Bofors scam. ""That demand was fulfilled then,"" he said adding, ""Therefore, the demand for a JPC to probe into the Rafale issue cannot be ignored now.""",2018-10-13,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections,BJP,BJP-Shiv Sena Alliance,Bofors,Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC),Maharashtra Assembly Elections,NCP,NewsTracker,Rafale Scam,Sharad Pawar,Shiv Sena","Sharad Pawar says BJP, Shiv Sena may join hands for Lok Sabha elections, but not for Maharashtra Assembly polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sharad-pawar-says-bjp-shiv-sena-may-join-hands-for-lok-sabha-elections-but-not-for-maharashtra-assembly-polls-5372711.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sreemoy Talukdar,"It is no secret that Indian National Congress is going through a severe crunch of funds and has been forced to take a slew of austerity measures. The interesting bit is how the Rahul Gandhi-led party is gaslighting on transparency and “outreach” to make a virtue out of necessity. To be sure, paucity of resources is not a crime. It is an indication of Congress’ altered political fortunes. Congress was at its lowest ebb when it relinquished power at the Centre in 2014. Since then, its national footprint has steadily eroded. The party is in power now in just three states (Karnataka, Punjab, and Mizoram), down from 15 in 2013. It shares power with JD(S) in Karnataka and rules Punjab, which barely qualifies as a “big state”. In terms of raising funds, which is easier when a party is in power, Meghalaya and Mizoram are almost inconsequential. Unsurprisingly, the party is facing an acute financial crisis. Congress has also not helped its cause by taking a strident ‘anti-business’ stance. Rahul’s habitual slandering of big business could be political opportunism to position himself as “pro-poor” but it has led to an erosion of trust among captains of industry on Congress president’s ability to lead instead of just being a disruptive influence. Not surprisingly, corporate donations have dried up. “We don’t have money,” Divya Spandana, who leads the Congress’ social media department, was recently quoted as saying by  . The party’s income slumped to Rs 2.25 billion rupees, a drop of 14 percent from previous year while BJP’s coffers swelled to Rs 10.34 billion in the same period.  Carnegie senior fellow Milan Vaishnav as saying, “Headed into 2019, the BJP has a decisive fundraising advantage, not least because the Congress and other key regional parties are seen as less business-friendly.” Elections in India are expensive affairs. Congress needs money, and quickly. The party hopes to tide over this cash crunch in two ways:  and crowdsourcing its funds. Accordingly, office-bearers have been asked to minimise travel expenses (taking trains instead of airplanes, for instance, or settle for the cheapest flight if train fares are higher), MPs have been urged not to seek travel allowances and party workers have been instructed to take a haircut on everything, including use of vehicles, canteen expenditure, computer peripherals, electricity usage and even newspapers. The party also hopes to raise at least Rs 500 crore through its crowdfunding programme ‘Lok Sampark Abhigyan’ that began on 2 October and will continue till 19 November. Congress eventually plans to make it an annual affair.   the party has identified one crore booth-level workers who will visit each home “with vouchers containing receipts of Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to seek donations to ‘tide over the party’s fund deficiency vis-a-vis BJP’s deeper pockets’.” BJP’s financial strength is complemented by its structural superiority. Taking a leaf out of BJP’s book, Congress plans to turn its crowdfunding campaign into a multipurpose initiative where some aspects of BJP’s election machinery will be copied. BJP’s ‘panna pramukh’ model, for instance, has “inspired” Congress into launching its ‘Congress sahyogi’ programme where party workers—in charge of each booth—along with collecting donations will also remain connected with families all through the year. They will conduct door-to-door campaign, create awareness among voters, rope in youngsters and  , influential people and businessmen right from the booth-level up to the state-level prior to the general elections”. There is nothing wrong with the Congress imitating its rival, provided it succeeds in pulling it off. It is good to see Congress shaking off its lethargy and showing some initiative in tackling BJP. A deviation from its trademark laissez-faire politics was long overdue. The problem with Congress, however, is that it appears unable to recognise the importance of integrity in political messaging. There’s nothing wrong in running out of cash. There is nothing wrong, once again, in reaching out to voters for donations. If anything, it may make the voters more invested in Congress. However, this gesture of probity and sincerity sits at odds with Congress’s reflexive gaslighting. Its leaders, even while approaching the voters for funds, cannot resist indulging in fake moral posturing, with the result that the entire crowdfunding campaign that rests on virtue-signalling, comes crashing down. Sample a few comments from Congress leaders. According to   “Industrialists fear donating to Congress because of the politically motivated income tax raids. We will go door to door to ask for money and urge people to help us overthrow a dictatorial government. These are arrogant people who think they will rule for 50 years.” Congress has fashioned its crowdfunding as “BJP’s cash power” versus “people’s power”. The party evidently believes that paucity of funds has washed the scam taints off its face and it can now pose once again as a “clean party”, never mind if that “cleanliness” is forced by circumstances. Sachin Pilot, Congress’ CM-designate in Rajasthan, told news agency   Congress stands for “transparency” and “transparent resource mobilisation” and   that “BJP has enough money, power and resources. They do not lack anything. The Congress believes in politics of principles and hence, we have got people’s love and trust and that is our biggest strength...” It is a very righteous and utterly romantic way of rebranding a publicity stunt. Had Congress been so averse to corporate funding out of principle (and not necessity), it would have refused all forms of funding from industrialists when it was in power.   to Congress and BJP between fiscal 2004-05 and 2011-12 (during UPA-I and UPA-II) reveals Congress received as much corporate contributions, if not more, compared to the BJP during that period. The Aditya Birla Group, for instance, contributed Rs 36.4 crore to the Congress and Rs 26.6 crore to the BJP; The Tata Group donated Rs 10 crore to the Congress and Rs 6.9 crore to the BJP; Bharti Enterprises donated Rs 11 crore to the Congress while it gave the BJP Rs 6.1 crore. These figures clearly show that Congress was not averse to corporate money when it flowed in but started believing in “politics of principle” and “people’s trust” only when the funds dried up. Taking money from people isn’t wrong, but Congress’s sleight of hand lies in adopting a pseudo moralistic tone and window-dressing dire necessity to make it look like probity. The intellectual dishonesty inherent in this exercise exposes the moral decay within Congress. As for austerity measures, in 2013 when the Manmohan Singh government and finance minister P Chidamabaram were mulling “austerity measures” to boost Indian economy amid a global economic slowdown, it turned out that the UPA spent Rs 21 lakh from public exchequer to celebrate its fourth anniversary at a dinner party thrown by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 22 May at his 7 Race Course Road residence.  under the RTI Act showed that celebrations “cost the exchequer Rs 20,61,359. This included tentage charges of Rs 11,15,819, catering charges of Rs 6,30,874, electricity charges of Rs 3,03,770 and flower arrangement charges of Rs 10,896.”  For the 300 guests who attended the event, that works out to Rs 6,871.20 per head. So much for austerity! Congress’ moral turpitude hasn’t come about in a vacuum. It is the inevitable result of a party that has long treated power as its entitlement, and now appears to be struggling outside its trappings. It seems to have lost the ability to even sound sincere without appearing flippant.",2018-10-13,"Ahmed Patel,Ashok Gehlot,BJP,Congress,Congress President Rahul Gandhi,InMyOpinion,Mission Rs 500 Crore,Narendra Modi,PoliticalPlay,Politics,Rahul Gandhi","Cash-strapped Congress gaslights public while collecting funds, lays bare moral rot at heart of party",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/cash-strapped-congress-gaslights-public-while-collecting-funds-lays-bare-moral-rot-at-heart-of-party-5374451.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Less than two months after courting controversy for hugging Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa at a time when India's relation with its neighbour were at its lowest, Navjot Sidhu stirred up a fresh controversy on Saturday, when he drew an unwarranted cultural analogy between Pakistan and South India. Speaking at a literary festival in Kasol, Sidhu said, ""If I go to Tamil Nadu, I don’t understand the language. Not that I don’t like the food, but I can’t take it for long.

Press Trust of India," Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Amit Shah on Saturday asked the party workers to ensure that the saffron party retained power in Chhattisgarh in next month's Assembly election by winning over 65 of the 90 seats. The Chhattisgarh Assembly polls will be held in two phases — on 12 and 20 November — and the counting of votes will be taken up on 11 December. Shah was addressing a convention of the booth-level BJP workers from Raipur and Durg divisions at the Science College ground in Raipur. He told the workers that the BJP had reached the ""pinnacle of success"", but its target would only be achieved when it attained power in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal. Shah claimed that the presence of nearly one lakh booth-level workers and their eagerness showed that the BJP would win 65-plus seats in the forthcoming state Assembly polls. ""From 10 members, the party has grown to 11 crore members, becoming the world's largest party. We have 1,800 MLAs, 330 MPs, governments in 19 states and a government at the Centre with full majority. The BJP flag is being hoisted over 70 per cent of the country's area and the credit for it goes to the booth workers,"" he said. ""Our struggle started in 1950 and today, we are fortunate to see this grand form of the party. The journey was not simple. Lakhs of our workers devoted and sacrificed their lives, as a result of which the party has reached here,"" Shah said, adding that the workers of the saffron party continued to ""sacrifice their lives"" in Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. ""As a result of a long struggle, the party has reached the pinnacle of success. But do not consider it as a success because Bengal, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are yet to be won,"" he said. ""Party workers all over the country are watching the (upcoming) Assembly elections. The victories in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh should be such that they create a tsunami, which will ensure victory from West Bengal to Kerala,"" the BJP chief told the gathering."" He said BJP workers were thrashed when Ajit Jogi (formerly with the Congress and now the chief of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh) was the chief minister of the state from 2000 to 2003. Naxalism had thrived in the state under the Congress regime, Shah said, adding that it was crushed during the 15-year rule of Chief Minister Raman Singh. Heaping praise on Singh, the BJP chief said the chief minister had turned Chhattisgarh from a ""bimaru"" (backward) state to a ""fast developing"" state. He said Singh now wanted to make Chhattisgarh a prosperous state over the next five years. Shah told the booth-level workers of his party that poll victory would be achieved when they visited every house in their areas to apprise the people of the ruling BJP's achievements. He hit out at Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ordering surgical strikes in September, 2016 to smash terror camps operating out of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Press Trust of India," Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday accused the BJP and the RSS of being supporters of ""capitalist system"" and attacked the Modi government over the Rafale fighter jet deal. Sounding her party's bugle for the next month's Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, she said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are raising the Ram temple issue with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She said this while addressing a joint rally in Bilaspur with Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) chief Ajit Jogi. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister has entered into an alliance with Jogi for the Assembly polls to be held in two phases — on 12 and 20 November. As per the alliance, the BSP will contest 35 seats, while the Jogi-led JCC will fight the remaining 55 seats in the 90-member Assembly. Jogi has been declared the chief ministerial candidate of the coalition. ""The BJP and RSS are supporters of capitalist system and they have been using various ' ' (measures) in the name of Hindutva,"" the BSP chief said. ""As the elections are approaching, the issue of Ram mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, is gaining momentum. On the same lines, they (the BJP and RSS) have planned to construct small temples in the entire country but they will not get any benefit out of it,"" the Dalit leader added. Targeting the Modi government over the Rafale fighter jet deal, Mayawati said, ""In the matter of defence deals in the country, the role of both the Congress and the BJP have not been clean."" ""Like the Bofors scam during the Congress government, questions are being raised about the BJP government over the alleged scam in the Rafale deal. But so far it (the Centre) has not given any satisfactory answer,"" she said. Mayawati accused the BJP-led NDA government of being negligent in containing the incidents of mob lynching in the country. ""A dangerous trend of mob lynching has been prevailing in the country in the name of   (cow protection). Attacks by mob is a blot on democracy."" ""This is a result of bias towards Dalits, adivasis, backward communities, Muslims and Christians. The BJP government has been apathetic and negligent over the mob lynching incidents."" ""After such forces (apparently referring to the BJP and RSS) came to power, these incidents have increased to a dangerous level,"" she added. The BSP chief said the Modi government has failed to fulfil promises made ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. ""The ruling BJP at the Centre did not fulfil even one fourth of the promises made during the 2014 elections. It had promised to bring back black money stashed in foreign accounts and deposit Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh in accounts of people, but it was not done,"" she said. The Modi government has ""failed"" on other fronts also, the former UP chief minister said. ""They talked about curbing price rise, tackling unemployment and ensuring welfare of the poor, but did nothing. They have ditched the poor, youth and farmers of the country,"" Mayawati alleged. She slammed the Modi government over its economic policies, demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), and said people are bearing the burnt of rising inflation. Mayawati also attacked the Congress, saying the party was spreading lies about the BSP after she refused to enter into a pre-poll alliance with it in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. ""Rumours are being spread that under pressure from the BJP, the BSP did not form an alliance with the Congress. All these allegations are baseless and BSP workers should not take them seriously,"" she asserted. Mayawati appealed to people to bring in change in Chhattisgarh, alleging the BJP had done nothing for tribals, Dalits, backward communities and the poor during its 15 years rule in the state. The alliance (between the BSP and the JCC) is very important for the people of Chhattisgarh because the BJP government has been ""anti- dalit, ant-poor, anti-tribal and anti-poor"", she said. Both the Congress and the BJP are responsible for the ""pathetic"" condition of Chhattisgarh, Mayawati claimed. The development of Dalits, tribals, farmers, backward communities and traders is possible only when the BSP-JCC alliance is voted to power, she said.",2018-10-22,"Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,Bahujan Samaj Party,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Chhattisgarh Polls,Congress,JCC,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,Politics,RSS,TheySaidIt","Mayawati at Chhattisgarh rally calls BJP, RSS supporters of 'capitalist system', attacks Centre over Rafale deal",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mayawati-at-chhattisgarh-rally-calls-bjp-rss-supporters-of-capitalist-system-attacks-centre-over-rafale-deal-5374531.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"In a major setback to the Opposition Congress in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, its state working president and MLA Ramdayal Uike on Saturday joined the ruling BJP. Uike, who represents Pali-Tanakhar constituency, joined the BJP in the presence of the party chief Amit Shah and Chief Minister Raman Singh in Bilaspur district headquarter. Uike, considered a popular tribal leader in Bilaspur division, said he was feeling suffocated in the Congress as Scheduled Tribes (ST) leaders were being neglected by the party leadership. In a press conference held in Bilaspur in the presence of the chief minister as well BJP state unit president Dharamlal Kaushik, he announced that he joined the BJP. ""I had been feeling suffocated in Congress for the last several years. Congress has diverted from its ideology and principles. The CD politics of Congress has tarnished its image. State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has maligned the image of the party by encouraging the obscene CD politics,"" he said. Uike was apparently referring to a case of circulation of a 'sex CD' purportedly featuring a state minister, in which Baghel was named as one of the five accused. He further said his party high command did not pay attention to his demand to remove Baghel from the post of state unit president. ""Congress has neglected the interests of tribals, backward and poor people and I was pained over it as I represent a tribal region. Chief Minister Raman Singh has been making efforts for overall development of tribals and backward people and his development oriented policies have impressed me to rejoin my home party,"" he further said. Uike, who had quit the BJP and joined the Congress in 2000, described his return to the ruling party as ""ghar wapsi"". When asked about contesting elections, he said he will follow the directions of the party leadership in this regard. Reacting to the development, Congress dubbed Uike as an ""opportunist"" and said his decision will not harm the Opposition party. ""Uike has gone back to BJP, which he had left earlier for opportunistic reasons. He has again proved that he is an opportunist,"" Congress state communication wing chief Shailesh Nitin Trivedi told  . ""His decision is not going to harm Congress in any way as history is witness that the party in which Uike was there, it had never won. In fact we are thankful to Uike that he has left our party and ensured victory to us,"" Trivedi said. After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, Uike who was a BJP MLA from Marwahi seat had joined Congress and vacated his seat to facilitate the entry of Ajit Jogi into the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly after he was sworn-in as first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh. According to BJP sources, Uike was not happy after he was ousted from the Congress screening committee and since then he had been in touch with ruling party leadership. The BJP may field Uike either from Marwahi or Pali Tanakhar - the ST reserved seats, both considered as his stronghold.

Press Trust of India," The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday declared tribal leader Komal Hupendi as its chief ministerial candidate in Chhattisgarh where elections are scheduled to be held next month. The Arvind Kejriwal-led party is making its maiden dash at the hustings in Chhattisgarh, where the electoral contest has always been two-dimensional--between the BJP and the Congress. The move is seen as an attempt to woo tribal communities in the state. ""The party has projected its Bhanupratappur Assembly seat nominee Hupendi as its CM face after consulting top leaders of the party and local leadership,"" AAP state in-charge Gopal Rai told a press conference in Raipur. Hupendi, 37, had joined the AAP in 2016 after quitting as Cooperative Extension Officer with the state government, he said. He is a native of Mungwal village in Bhanupratappur area. Hupendi is contesting his maiden election from Bhanupratappur Assembly seat.

Press Trust of India,": The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) on Thursday hit back at BJP president Amit Shah for questioning its supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao's move to go in for early elections in the state, saying he has done exactly what the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi chose to do in 2002. Addressing a BJP rally at Karimnagar, some 160 km from Hyderabad on Wednesday, Shah had hit out at caretaker chief minister Rao, saying it has thrust additional election expenditure of hundreds of crores of rupees on people of the state, which in the normal course should have gone to the polls, along with that of Lok Sabha during April-May next year. Shah also claimed KCR's move stemmed from the fact that he is ""scared"" of Modi, suggesting that the Modi factor would have influenced the state polls, had it been held simultaneously with Lok Sabha. The Telangana assembly elections will be held on 7 December. The assembly was dissolved on 6 September on the recommendation of Rao, cutting short the term of the House by nearly nine months. Speaking to  , Karimnagar Lok Sabha member B Vinod Kumar sought to counter Shah. Kumar, also deputy floor leader of the TRS in the Lok Sabha, said at some point or the other, leaders, including Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, NT Rama Rao and N Chandrababu Naidu, have opted for early elections. ""All political parties have gone in for early elections some time or other. Even Modi also. Why did Modi go for early elections in 2002? Modi should answer first. Just like KCR did, he also went for elections in 2002 eight months before the schedule. Why Modi went (for early elections)? That's the reply for KCR also,"" he said. Kumar also responded to Shah's charge that KCR promised to make a Dalit the chief minister before the 2014 elections but did not honour it; and also that his agenda now is to make his son (KT Rama Rao) or daughter (K Kavitha) chief minister. Rama Rao was a Cabinet minister in the dissolved assembly, while Kavitha is Lok Sabha member from Nizamabad. ""Amit Shah should know that KCR did not make such a statement in the 2014 elections. He made such a statement during the course of our (Telangana statehood) agitation. At the time of the 2014 elections, we were very clear that KCR would be our chief minister. In 2014, we never said (that a Dalit would be made CM),"" Vinod Kumar said. ""Neither a Dalit, nor KTR (as Rama Rao is popularly known) nor Kavitha will be on the agenda because KCR will be elected chief minister once again,"" he claimed. Kumar described as ""very unfortunate"" Shah's charge that KCR and Congress president Rahul Gandhi are engaged in 'break-in-India', while Modi is in 'make-in-India' mode. 
""Supporting minorities and speaking for reservations for minorities... does it mean break in India?"" he asked.

Press Trust of India," Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor, who is facing the heat over the violence against Hindi-speaking migrants in Gujarat, will be sitting on a day-long fast Thursday to establish ""peace and harmony"". He announced the `Sadbhavna Upvas' (fast for goodwill) at his house a couple of days ago. A large number of Hindi-speaking migrant workers have left Gujarat in the last few days following attacks at some places. The ruling BJP has blamed Thakor and his outfit, Gujarat Kshatriya-Thakor Sena, for the outbreak of violence. The outfit's name also figures in some of the FIRs filed in connection with the attacks, which started after a worker hailing from Bihar was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha district on 28 September.

Press Trust of India,": Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor, who is facing heat over the violence against hindi-speaking migrants in Gujarat, began his day-long fast on Thursday to promote ""peace and harmony"" among people. While admitting that ""someone may have said something"" against migrants, he claimed that the real culprits were those who politicised the entire issue. Since the rape of a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha district on 28 September and the arrest of a labourer hailing from Bihar for the crime, six districts in Gujarat saw sporadic incidents of violence against hindi-speaking people. The attacks led to exodus of over 60,000 migrants, mostly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. In his address at the 'Sadbhavna Upvas' (fast for goodwill) venue near his residence in Ranip area, Thakor asserted he never indulged in spreading hatred. ""I am not at all into spreading hatred. I am not that kind of person. We (Thakor community) are pure at heart. It is possible that someone may have said something (against migrants), but we do not harbour any grudge against anyone. We never indulge in violence,"" the Congress MLA said. Thakor, who heads a community outfit named 'Gujarat Kshatriya Thakor Sena', said some people were indulging in politics over the issue. ""We all need to make sure that Gujarat's image does not get tarnished. No one is migrant... the word itself is wrong. I think some people are politicising the issue. This is an attempt to break the country. Dividing people in the name of states is something I or my people will never do,"" he said. Earlier, following the rape of the 14-month-old girl, Thakor had publicly blamed a ""non-Gujarati"" for the crime. Referring to the incident, the MLA from Radhanpur constituency on Thursday claimed that he and his people were branded ""anti-nationals"" for demanding justice for the girl. ""I will never allow this poison of division to spread among people in Gujarat... I think such incidents are part of a conspiracy to malign Gujarat's image. This is a conspiracy to create enmity among poor people,"" he said. ""We only demanded justice for the 14-month old girl. But, we were labelled as anti-nationals. We are not like that. We may have committed some mistakes, but we are not those who harass poor people. Ultimately, we all are Indians. Stop maligning our image,"" Thokar said. Although police have arrested several members of the Thakor Sena in connection with the attacks on hindi-speaking people and also named the outfit in some of the FIRs, the Congress legislator claimed that police were harassing ""innocent"" youths from his community. ""It is the state government's responsibility to arrest people if they are involved. But, at least do not politicise the issue. We are not culprits. Many innocent Thakor youths are wrongfully arrested,"" he alleged. Before starting his fast Thakor visited the Sabarmati Ashram and paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi. Thakor told reporters that he will visit other states to spread the message of peace and harmony and urged the members of his community to invite migrants at their homes or visit them to build an atmosphere of trust. Congress MLA was caught in a controversy after a video went viral in which he was purportedly seen speaking against migrant workers. Authorities said on Wednesday that the number of hindi-speaking migrant workers leaving Gujarat has come down after they were reassured about their safety in the state. Police and district officials held meetings with migrant workers and factory owners at several places and told them that they need not worry about their safety.",2018-10-11,"Ahmedabad,Alpesh Thakor,Attacks On Non-Gujaratis,Bihar Migrants,Congress,Gujarat,Gujarat Kshatriya-Thakor Sena,Hindi-Speaking States,Madhya Pradesh,Migrants In Gujarat,NewsTracker,Uttar Pradesh Migrants","Alpesh Thakor begins day-long fast, says 'never indulged in violence' on migrants in Gujarat",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/alpesh-thakor-begins-day-long-fast-says-never-indulged-in-violence-on-migrants-in-gujarat-5360681.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party's national convener Arvind Kejriwal Thursday said his party will contest all the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab and not enter into alliance. ""We will fight on all Lok Sabha seats from the state, we will not enter into any tie-up with anyone,"" Kejriwal, who was in Bathinda to attend a party legislator's wedding, told reporters. He lashed out at the ruling Congress in the state and accused it of failing on all fronts. ""He (Amarinder) had promised to give a job in each family. He had said if anyone is unemployed then he will be given unemployment allowance. He had talked about raising social security pension, waiving debt of farmers, promised smartphones to youths. Only tall promises were made, but none have been fulfilled. He spoke lies and now people of Punjab are fed up with them,"" he alleged. Kejriwal said Singh had promised to wipe out drug problem from the state, but it was still there. He also charged the Congress government of failing to act on the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission's inquiry report on incidents of religious sacrilege in the state.

Kangkan Acharyya,"The North East Students Organisation (NESO), enthused by some Bharatiya Janata Party leaders' promises to update the   across the country if the party is voted to power in 2019, has demanded that the exercise be extended to other states of the North East with immediate effect. A delegation of NESO, led by its advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya, on Wednesday met Union home minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju to raise the demand. At a press conference on Thursday, Bhattacharya said, ""Our demand is quite clear. The North East region should belong to Indians, and not illegal migrants from Bangladesh. In order to detect illegal migrants, delete their names from the voters' list and deport them from India to Bangladesh, the NRC is the first step.” Bhattacharya warned that after the NRC updation process began in Assam, some illegal migrants shifted their base to other states of the North East. Though he did not share any data on the number of suspected illegal migrants who have entered other states of the region, he said that they pose a grave threat to the unique identity of the other states as well. “In the meeting with the Union home minister, we have demanded a comprehensive policy to protect the identity of the indigenous tribes and ethnic groups of the region,” he added. Although the demand to update the NRC in Assam is 40 years old, the issue of detection of illegal migrants hardly ever found space in national politics. In fact, from 1979 to 1985, 855 young agitators who demanded the detection of illegal immigrants were killed in Assam. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have vehemently opposed the NRC updation process in Assam, which began in 2015 after a Supreme Court order. In the exercise, 4 million people were left out of the final draft. The BJP, on its part, has contended that illegal immigrants are a threat to national security and some party leaders have said that the party would update the NRC across the nation if voted back to power in 2019. On Wednesday, BJP chief  , addressing a convention of party workers in Rajasthan, said that BJP governments will ""drive each and every infiltrator out of the country"" after winning elections in 2018 and 2019. Although the demand for updating the NRC is gaining momentum in the region, there is a counter view which holds that the process will leave out many genuine citizens. “Conducting this process in Meghalaya would be an exercise in futility, because many people would not have the requisite documents. Tribal communities are very bad at maintaining any records,” said Patricia Mukhim in an interview with  . Mukhim, however, said that if the NRC is to be updated, it should be done throughout the country. On the problem of tribal communities not having proper records, Sinam Prakash Singh, secretary general of the NESO, said, ""This could be a problem. That is why we say that it is not necessary that other states should follow the same modalities as Assam.” Bhattacharya said that there is no chance of members of local tribes being left out of the NRC. “We all know the indigenous tribes and ethnic groups in the northeastern region, as well as their surnames. So, they can be directly identified and included in the NRC,” he said. While the NESO agrees with the Centre on the issue of updating the NRC, it has vehemently opposed the Centre’s move to pass the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016. The Bill seeks to grant citizenship to illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians. However, it doesn’t have a provision for Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmediyas, who also face persecution in Pakistan. Bhattacharya said, ""“Religion cannot be the basis of citizenship in India, as per constitutional norms. There has been a long-standing demand to free the North East from illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But there has been an equally powerful conspiracy to favour the illegal migrants. We can see the same design in the Citizenship Amendment Bill. So, we apprised the home minister of the situation.” The NESO advisor also demanded that the government of India should enter into a treaty with the Bangladesh government to deport illegal Bangladeshis from India. He also said that the government should provide indigenous people of the region exclusive rights over their land and natural resources.",2018-10-11,"Assam,Bangladesh,BJP,Congress,ConnectTheDots,National Register Of Citizens,North East,North East Students' Organisation,NRC,Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya",Assam NRC: Prominent students' organisation seeks updation of citizens' register in other states of North East,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/assam-nrc-prominent-students-organisation-seeks-updation-of-citizens-register-in-other-states-of-north-east-5362981.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The Shiv Sena and another Hindu organisation claimed to have forcibly shut around 400 meat and chicken shops at different locations in Gurugram on Wednesday, demanding that they remain closed during Navaratri. Chief of Shiv Sena's Gurgaon unit Gautam Saini told   that around 300 members of different Hindu organisations assembled at the Lord Shiva temple located at the Old Railway road on Wednesday morning and headed to different places to close meat shops. Locals claimed a group of Sena workers assembled at Palam Vihar on Wednesday and forcibly shut down meat markets in Surat Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Sector 5 and 9, Pataudi Chowk, Jacobpura, Sadar Bazaar, Khandsa Anaj Mandi, Bus Stand, DLF area, Sohna and Sector 14. They said 50 percent of the shops are already closed amid fears of clashes as such exercise is launched every year around Navratri since the BJP came to power in 2014 at the Center and in Haryana. State president of Hindu Sena Ritu Raj said, ""The Hindu organizations will continue their effort throughout Navratri. The next target is new Gurgaon where there are a large number of meat shops."" Majority of the meat sellers used blinds to cover their shops. However, the Sena and other Hindu outfits have threatened to close them down too, sellers alleged. ""We have requested and served notices to every meat selling outlet to shut shop during Navaratri. This time we have not served notices to restaurants, like KFC and other chains, as them serving chicken cannot be seen in the open,"" Shiv Sena's Gurgaon in-charge Sanjay Thakral told PTI. The party workers have also asked owners of non-vegetarian food outlets to shut shop during the nine-day festival. ""We have requested every meat shop owner to close their outlets. Sixty shops have been shut. If the rest 940 shops remain open, then we will have no option but to forcefully shut them down like we did in the previous couple of years,"" Thakral said. There are nearly 1,000 meat and chicken shops in Gurugram. A dispute emerged during the march by workers of Hindu outfits on Wednesday morning to close the shops and local police arrested some of the leaders. ""We have arrested four leaders of Hindu organisations during the march. An FIR has been registered against them under relevant sections of the IPC for disturbing peace. Further investigation is underway,"" Gurgaon police PRO Subhash Bokan said. Asked if the meat shops were forcibly shut, DCP (crime) Sumit Kuhar said, ""We are looking into the matter. No one is authorised to take law in their hands. We will not let anyone forcibly close down meat shops during Navaratri. If anyone wants to voluntarily close his shop, then it is up to him. We have directed all city SHOs to keep a watch on the situation.""

Press Trust of India,"The Congress on Thursday accused the Centre and the erstwhile BJP-PDP government in Jammu and Kashmir of ""spoiling"" the atmosphere in the state and held them responsible for the current situation there, where people are ""afraid"" to cast their vote. The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who hails from the state, said this was not the first time that voter turnout in municipal polls in the Kashmir Valley has been low compared to that in the Jammu region. Senior party leader Ambika Soni alleged that the state and central governments are squarely responsible for the current situation and for bringing the state to a level where the ""fear of bullet forced people not to cast their vote"". The two leaders claimed the previous Congress-National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir had helped normalise the situation and people had been coming out in large numbers to exercise their franchise. But the erstwhile BJP-PDP government and the Centre has brought the situation to that prevailing in the early 1990s, they alleged. ""The Central government spoiled the entire atmosphere in the Kashmir Valley and took us back to the early nineties. ""So I squarely hold the Centre responsible for this, for creating a situation where people are afraid to go to the polling stations,"" Azad told reporters after former PDP MLC Vikramaditya Singh, the son of ex-Union minister Karan Singh, joined the Congress. The second phase of the municipal polls in the state on Wednesday, saw 78.6 percent of over 1.28 lakh voters exercising their franchise in Jammu, while in Kashmir region 3.4 percent of 2.20 lakh electorate cast their votes. The low voter turnout in Kashmir was in line with a meagre 8.3 per cent turnout in the Valley during the first phase of the election. Azad said this was not the first time that there was a huge gap between Kashmir and Jammu regions in terms of voter turnout. ""This is not first time since we had militancy, which has been for almost three decades. In between, of course, things had improved when we were in power. After the BJP and the PDP formed a coalition government, things went from bad to worse. ""So, for this we shouldn't be held responsible, the Centre and the BJP should be held responsible for worsening the condition of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. On being asked about holding simultaneous polls for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and the Lok Sabha, Soni, who is AICC general secretary in-charge of party affairs in the state, said the Congress has fought elections despite tough situations. ""We congratulate all the candidates, but that doesn't change the scenario there... With what face or how are they (BJP) going to convince the people that the law and order situation is in full control. We will assess it after this election,"" she said. After joining the party, Vikramaditya Singh said he was disillusioned with the PDP as it ""failed"" to fulfil its promises and ""betrayed"" the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Vikramaditya Singh had joined the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (JKPDP) at the instance of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and was nominated as a member of the state Legislative Council in 2015. He resigned in October, 2017, both as an MLC and from the party, following differences with the coalition government headed by then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. Azad said Karan Singh had joined Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet heralding a young generation entering politics and now his son, Vikramaditya Singh, has joined the Congress heralding the entry of the new generation. ""Vikramaditya Singh brings with him a rich political legacy and we hope that he will help weaken the BJP and strengthen the Congress in the Jammu region and in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. The PDP-BJP combine had formed government in the state with promises of reducing distances between people of the Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir regions and ushering in development in the state, but just the opposite has happened, Azad alleged. ""Distances between people of the three regions of the state have risen, unemployment and terrorism have also spiked, while development and tourism went down,"" the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said. Vikramaditya Singh said he quit the PDP as ""it betrayed the people of Jammu and Kashmir by not fulfilling the promises made to the people, including safety and facilities like making bunkers for them and farmers living along the Indo-Pak border"". Vikramaditya Singh said he was happy that he was in the Congress to which his father belonged and remained a member for over 50 years. Besides Soni and Azad, Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir was also present at the joining event of Singh.

Indo-Asian News Service," The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Thursday accused the Congress, the BJP and the RSS of using the Supreme Court ruling allowing women in the 10-50 age group to enter the Sabarimala temple to try to topple the Kerala government. Addressing the media after a high-level LDF meeting, LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan claimed that there was a secret pact between the Congress and the BJP/RSS. ""The attempt to overthrow the Pinarayi Vijayan government by raising emotions over the Sabarimala verdict is meant to disturb peace in the state,"" said Vijayaraghavan. He added that the state government was duty bound to implement the apex court directive and it was doing just that. The LDF, led by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), also decided to launch counter political rallies across the state. The first one would be held at Pathanamthitta, the district where the Sabarimala temple is located, on 16 October. It would be addressed by Vijayan. On 24 October, a rally would be held at Kollam. The LDF will soon decide the dates of rallies in other districts this month. Meanwhile, the BJP is leading a ‘long march' to the state capital from Alappuzha which will reach Thiruvananthapuram on 15 October. ""The state government, if it requests the Centre to bring an ordinance against the verdict, I am sure it will be done,"" state BJP President PS Sreedharan Pillai told the media. In the state capital, BJP youth wing members clashed with the police after they were prevented from entering the official residence of Devasom Minister K Surendran. Speaking to the media, Surendran said the BJP had hijacked the protests and was now giving political colour to the Sabarimala verdict. ""The BJP is trying to recreate what they did during the controversial ‘rath yatra'"" of 1989, he said. Various Hindu organisations also launched a ‘long march' to the state capital from Pandalam and will reach Thiruvananthapuram on 14 October to protest against the state government for not filing a review petition against the apex court verdict.

FP Staff,"Soon after Rahul Gandhi demanded an investigation against Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding his role in the Rafale deal and called him a ""corrupt man"", the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Congress president of ""lying"" and said that the entire   is ""corrupt."" Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra asked Rahul the reason for not approaching the Supreme Court if he claims to have all documents to prove corruption. Referring to Rahul's statement that even former French president has said that the Prime Minister of India is corrupt, Patra challenged the Congress chief to produce a statement where Francois Hollande has claimed thus. Patra accused the Congress leader of ""lying through his teeth shamelessly"" in wrongly quoting the former French president. Quoting Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa as saying that the Rafale deal would be a ""game-changer"", Patra said that Rahul is saying the exact opposite. He asked to country to decide if they want to believe in Rahul or Dhanoa, while accusing the Congress chief of playing with national security.  He further said that Rahul stated in the Parliament that there is no secrecy clause between the countries however, the French government issued a statement moments later refuting his claims. During the debate on the no-confidence motion, Rahul had said that French president Emmanuel Macron had clearly conveyed to him that there was no problem in sharing details relating to the Rafale deal. However,  , France said, ""France and India concluded in 2008 a security agreement, which legally binds the two States to protect the classified information provided by the partner, that could impact security and operational capabilities of the defence equipment of India or France."" The BJP leader further said the Supreme Court has also dismissed a PIL (public interest litigation) that had questioned the aircraft's price and sought the deal cancelled. The Congress-led UPA government had jeopardised the country's defence as the squadron strength of the Air Force fell to 31 from 44, he alleged. Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra did not get his share in the Rafale deal and therefore the UPA government cancelled it, he claimed.  Rafale deal is 'clear-cut' case of corruption while reiterating his earlier statement about Reliance Defence being deliberately chosen by the government as the Offset partner for the deal. Dassault Aviation, the company manufacturing the aircraft had issued a statement clarifying on the pact with the Indian government, reiterating that it ""freely chose to partner with Reliance Group"".

Press Trust of India,": Taking his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi to poll-bound Rajasthan, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax, which he referred to as Gabbar Singh Tax, had destroyed India's economy. Addressing a rally in Dholpur's Mania area, Rahul said the prime minister had declared during elections that he wanted to be a ' ' but never clarified who he wanted to guard. The Congress president alleged that he benefited 15-20 industrialists of the country instead of farmers. According to Rahul, the former UPA government led by his party had waived farmers' loans worth Rs 70,000 crore.

Press Trust of India," BSP supremo Mayawati asserted on Tuesday that her party will rather fight elections on its own than ""beg"" for seats in any alliance. Her comments assume significance as she had last week called off talks with the Congress to fight the upcoming Assembly polls in three states together as it did not agree to part with as many seats for the BSP as she demanded. A Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) statement quoting her also lashed out at the Congress and the BJP, saying the BSP will never compromise with the self-respect of the Dalits, tribals, backwards, Muslims, other minorities and the upper castes' poor irrespective of the ""malice and torture"" of the governments run by these two parties. That is why the BSP has put forth the condition of being given a ""respectable number"" of seats to enter into an electoral alliance, Mayawati said, according to the statement. ""What it clearly means that the BSP will not beg for seats in any alliance. If this (respectable number of seats) does not happen, then it will continue to fight polls on its own,"" she said. Speaking on the occasion of the death anniversary of the BSP founder Kanshi Ram, she said neither the Congress nor the BJP works in the interests of the upper castes' poor and the remaining majority.

Ishfaq Naseem,"No posters, no banners, no campaigns. In Kashmir, authorities are geared up for the second phase of the civic polls on Wednesday, but residents continue to be indifferent even a day before the elections. A vegetable vendor in Srinagar's Shaheed Gunj area has no idea whether there are any candidates contesting the election from this ward of the Srinagar Municipal Corporation. When questioned, he got livid and didn't want to talk about the polls. A 42-year-old handicraft salesman, Inayat Ahmad also doesn't know whether there are any candidates contesting from his ward. The Srinagar resident also doesn't want to vote in the elections in protest against the ""continuous bloodshed in Kashmir"". ""How can we take part in the polls when the bloodshed continues unabated?’"" he asked, adding the the elections had affected his business, too, and was ""not doing us any good"". Furqan Muzafar, a 23-year-old who runs a ready-made garment shop in Srinagar's Basant Bagh area, said he was boycotting the polls as he want ""to see Kashmir free"". ""These elections are a sham. There is no point in taking part in the polls when atrocities by government forces continue,"" he said. Besides elections to 19 wards of Srinagar district, the polls will be held from 6 am to 4 pm in the northern districts of Kupwara, Bandipora and Baramulla as well as in the volatile southern parts of Kulgam and Anantnag. Moreover, even though elections were scheduled for 39 municipal bodies in Budgam, officials said polling was cancelled as there were either no contests in a number of wards, or political parties did not field any candidates. Additional Deputy Commissioner (Budgam) Khurshid Ahmad said that out of the 39 wards, no nominations were filed in 20 wards, while candidates in 19 other wards were elected unopposed. In Anantnag, 14 candidates were elected unopposed, three won uncontested from Kulgam, 15 in Baramulla, and nine in Kupwara. In the 13 municipal committee wards of Frisal in Kulgam, no candidate filed their nomination papers. Officials admitted that ""holding the elections didn't make any sense"" when people were unaware of even the names of the candidates contesting from their wards. A senior official in the District Election Office of Srinagar said, ""The candidates have told us that their names shouldn't be shared with the people."" The Station House Officer of Shaheedgunj Police Station said that the list of candidates contesting the polls was not shared ""due to the precarious security scenario"" in the region. ""A total of six polling stations have been set up for the polls here,"" the officer added. MLA from Langate and president of the Awami Ittehad Party, Engineer Rashid said elections were scheduled in his region on Wednesday, ""but people don’t know who are contesting"". Candidates were elected unopposed in nine of the 13 wards in Kupwara's Langate municipality where the polls were scheduled. ""There are no candidates in two wards, and the elections will be held only in two other wards,"" Rashid said. Like the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, the AIP also boycotted the urban local body elections in protest against the central government's move to abrogate Article 35A of the Constitution, which bars outsiders from owning properties in Kashmir. Rashid said that his party ""boycotted the polls as the conditions were not conducive to hold elections."" The handicraft salesman from Srinagar, who is steering clear of the elections in protest against the bloodshed in Kashmir, also asserted that ""if any attempt is made to revoke Article 35A, the situation will worsen in Kashmir, and the people will rise in an agitation like never before"". He added that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir had deteriorated under the PDP-BJP coalition government as well as under the current Governor's Rule.

Asian News International,": West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday held the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responsible for the alleged attacks on the people of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the state of Gujarat. Expressing concern, Banerjee said: ""Whatever is happening in Gujarat, of course, there is provocation and that is why such things are happening. People are scared, and that is why they are leaving Gujarat even after staying there for several years. This is a very dangerous trend, it is a disastrous situation. Why is the BJP not controlling the situation? BJP-ruled states are dangerous, I am concerned."" Non-Gujaratis, especially those hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were allegedly attacked recently after a native of Bihar was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha district recently. Speaking on the issue, Deputy Superintendent of Police of Vadodara, Haresh Mewada said, ""Labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar working in Param Industries and in another company were attacked after a message went viral, which said 'because of migrant workers, state people do not get work. So, make them move out of the state'."" He further said that 13 people have been arrested in the case. ""On the basis of an FIR filed by the injured, a case has been registered.

Asian News International,": Without taking names, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Tuesday urged political parties to end the blame game in the recent alleged violence in Gujarat which apparently led to exodus of migrants especially those belonging to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. She underscored that the Gujarat government should take strict action against those involved in the incident because north Indians are ""not foreigners"". Speaking to  , Mayawati said: ""There is no point of accusing each other. North Indians are not foreigners; they are citizens of our country. I appeal to the Gujarat government to take stringent action against the accused instead of doing politics on this matter."" Around 5-6 October, non-Gujaratis, especially those hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were allegedly attacked after a native of Bihar was arrested on accusations of allegedly raping a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha district. Subsequently, the violence stated to have led to many leaving the state. Voicing her concern over the Gujarat incident after paying floral tribute to BSP founder Kanshi Ram on his death anniversary, Mayawati further said: ""It is sad that people who voted and made Modi ji win from Varanasi are being targeted in Gujarat. The BJP government in Gujarat should ensure that strict action is taken against those responsible for such attacks."" Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ghanshyam Tiwari stated that attacking on migrants is an anti-poor mindset. ""First responsibility of the Gujarat government is to ensure that every citizen is safe in the state. Attacking migrants is an anti-poor mindset. If the state is unable to prevent such attack then the state is complicit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remember that if he cannot protect people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in his own home state Gujarat then he has no place in Uttar Pradesh as well,"" he said. Congress president Rahul Gandhi in his recent post blamed the Modi government for alleged violent attacks on north Indian migrants in Gujarat. The Gandhi scion had earlier tweeted and blamed poverty and unemployment as root causes of the situation in Gujarat. ""The system and the economy are both deteriorating. It is totally wrong to target expatriate workers. I will stand completely against it,"" he had said. On Monday, Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Giriraj Singh, however, accused the Congress of trying to spread hatred in the country.

Sanjay Singh,"Gujarat Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor has changed his tone on the Bihar-Uttar Pradesh migrant issue. He is now trying to strike a conciliatory note, almost saying they all are welcome in the state and claiming that thousands of those who left the state in the past few days didn’t flee under duress or under threat to life but have gone to their native places to celebrate Chhat Puja, which is over a month away. The sudden change in his public attitude is noteworthy. He is supposed to be the one who instigated his supporters on Gujarati versus Bihari and UPites after the most unfortunate incident of rape of a minor. The timing of Thakor’s change of heart is curious. It came after a severe crackdown by the police against those who were fanning hatred and violence against migrants and indulged in rioting at premises which employed workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It also came after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath took up the matter with Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and accused the Congress of supporting the miscreants. Since Monday afternoon the three BJP-NDA ruled states started acting in tandem in building right public perception and pinning Congress down over the issue. It is not difficult to understand what made Thakor reverse his position in a few days. Most of over 400 persons arrested by the Gujarat Police are from Thakor community, belonging to Thakor Sena patronised by Thakor. Some of those arrested are Congress workers. The arrests and the charges under which the miscreants were booked were stringent, which included rioting and dacoity. This leads to a situation where Thakor’s supporters may turn against him -- it is very difficult for the accused persons to get bail when booked under these charges. If they remain in jail for some time there is a possibility that he may face flak from family and close supporters of those booked under relevant provisions of law. That’s certainly not a healthy situation for Thakor. His core support base is from his community Thakor. The community was angry after a minor girl from the community was allegedly raped by a worker from Bihar. The MLA took their anger to a new high but it now appears that it spiralled out of control. The state agencies after initial softness decided to deal with the emerging situation with a heavy hand. That complicated Thakor’s problem. He can ill-afford any anguish of his own community members against him. The business community was very unhappy with the current disturbances and are turning against Thakor Sena and its backers in Congress. Second, there was a belated realisation in Congress that the party does not have to fight election only in Gujarat. It was a national party and has to take care of sentiments of people in other states. Even in Gujarat, only a small section of people are sympathetic of those attempting to chase away migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Though the party leadership was promoting Thakor in party’s hierarchical structure the emerging situation was a grim reminder that he couldn’t be trusted in handling situations like this which have short and long-term implications in Gujarat and in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where Congress is desperately trying to find a foothold. It was also turning Congress its oft-repeated charge against BJP that the latter was creating an atmosphere of fear and hatred on its head. More so, Thakor along with Shaktisinh Gohil is Congress’ central party in-charge of Bihar. The central and state leadership of the Congress was hoping that in alliance with Lalu Yadav’s RJD, the party would be able to improve its tally in 2019 parliamentary elections. Remember, in 2015 JD(U)-RJD- Congress had managed to win elections on   plank. Now Nitish Kumar and JD(U) is on BJP’s side, the pictures of Biharis being forced to flee Gujarat by Thakor’s men could badly hurt Congress’ prospects. In Uttar Pradesh Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have dumped Congress out of  (grand coalition) and the party does not have any realistic hope beyond Amethi and Raebareli. Thakor’s perceived villainous act against migrants from Uttar Pradesh could make Congress’ prospects even worse.",2018-10-10,"Alpesh Thakor,Congress,Gujarat Police,Nitish Kumar,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Shaktisinh Gohil,States,Thakor Sena,Vijay Rupani,Yogi Adityanath","Attack on migrants in Gujarat: Panicky Alpesh softens stand as rowdy Thakor Sena imperils Congress prospects in UP, Bihar",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/attack-on-migrants-in-gujarat-panicky-alpesh-softens-stand-as-rowdy-thakor-sena-imperils-congress-prospects-in-uttar-pradesh-bihar-5346851.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," A combative Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging he gave ""brooms to the poor"" in the name of the Swachh Bharat Mission while allowing his industrialist ""friends to clean money from the banks"". Rahul also levelled a slew of allegations at the BJP-led Centre, claiming it failed to provide relief to debt-saddled farmers while wreaking havoc on the economy with his demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) moves. He accused the prime minister of insulting the people by belittling what the country had achieved in the last 70 years. The Congress president began a roadshow from eastern Rajasthan's Dholpur district, considered the home turf of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, aiming to boost his party's prospects in the assembly elections slated for 7 December. Beginning the roadshow in Mania town, which shares borders with Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, he levelled allegations against the government on a range of issues ranging from the Rafale deal, law and order, and even the attack on people from other states in Gujarat. The Congress chief said it was not a party or a person but the people who by the dint of their hard work made India stand up after Independence. ""They were your parents and grandparents who put in efforts to make India stand but Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that nothing was done in the last 70 years. He says everything happened only after he came to power. How arrogant this person is,"" charged Rahul at a public meeting in Bayana town of Bharatpur during his 150-kilometre long roadshow. The Congress chief, in his public meetings during the roadshow, also said while Modi gave ""brooms to the poor and asked them to clean India under Swacch Bharat Abhiyan and at the same time, he asked top 15-20 industrialists to clean money from banks"". Attacking the Centre's economic and agricultural policies, he said, ""Not a single rupee of farmers' loans was waived by the Modi government"" and the Make In India campaign had ""failed"" with even phones and T-shirts being outsourced from China. The Congress wants phones to be made in India with the tag of 'Made in Dholpur,' he said. Rahul said the prime minister during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls had said he wanted to be a 'chowkidar' but never clarified for whom.  ""Now people are laughing. He never told that whose chowkidar he wanted to be. They got to know later that Anil Ambani is being protected,"" he alleged. Ambani-led Reliance Group has already rejected Congress' allegations. In Rajasthan, Rahul alleged that Modi benefitted 15-20 top industrialists of the country instead of the farmers. The Congress president reiterated his allegation on the Rafale deal that the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited was ignored and an ""industrialist friend"" benefitted from the deal which he claimed was finalised at higher prices compared to rates decided by the former UPA government. He also alleged that people like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Lalit Modi, Vijay Mallya had benefitted under the present dispensation. Rahul claimed that Vijay Mallya had alleged he had met Union minister Arun Jaitley before leaving the country. Significantly, Jaitley has rubbished any charges of impropriety. He claimed the former UPA government waived off farmers' loans worth Rs 70,000 crore but even as bad debt worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore were written off by the present government, not even Rs 1 of farmers was waived. ""Former UPA government gave MGNREGA, brought a tribal bill, rights of food and information, meal to students in schools, waived off farmers' loan worth Rs 70,000 crore. In Rajasthan, the Ashok Gehlot government introduced free medicine schemes but what Narendra Modi and Vasundhara Raje governments did for the poor?” he asked. I went to the prime minister's office only once and that too to raise farmers' issues but Modi remained silent and did not utter a single word, he claimed. ""Demonetisation and GST have finished the country's economy,"" he said continuing the attack. Referring to law and order issues, he alleged, ""A BJP MLA allegedly raped a woman in UP but the prime minister did not utter a word. They say Beti Bachao, they have forgotten Beti Padhao...BJP se Bachao (save from the BJP),"" he said taking a jibe. Targeting Vasundhara Raje, the Congress president alleged that Lalit Modi gave money directly to Raje's son.  However, he did not specify when and why Lalit Modi allegedly paid Raje's son Dushyant Singh. On the attack on migrants in Gujarat, he said youths from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were being attacked and forced to leave. ""Youth trusted Modi but Modi betrayed their trust,"" he charged. Rahul exuded confidence that the Congress would win the assembly elections in Rajasthan. He said the Congress government in the state will work as per people's 'Mann ki Baat'. He also urged people to form a Congress government at the Centre which would work for the poor, farmers and youths. He said people should try making RSS and BJP understand that there is no benefit in ""dividing"" the country. Congress state chief Sachin Pilot targeted Raje, saying she announced free electricity to farmers half an hour before the Model Code of Conduct came in force and asked where she was for over four and a half years.

Press Trust of India,": BJP president Amit Shah Tuesday sought to project the forthcoming elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as a contest between ""individual-centric"" parties and those driven by ideologies. He said the elections in the three states can ""change the nation"". Addressing a convention of youths in Gwalior, the Bharatiya Janata Party chief said the parties that lack leadership and policies cannot provide a stable government. ""Upcoming elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will prove to be ones that can change the nation because the contest will decide whether people elect parties which are individual-centric or those driven by ideology,"" Shah said in an apparent reference to political dynasties. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in the next two months in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram. While first three of the above states are currently ruled by the BJP, the Congress is in power in the northeastern state. Telangana was ruled by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) before Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dissolved the assembly. Lok Sabha elections are slated to be held next year. ""How is it possible for these parties to provide a strong government when they don't have any leader and even their policies are not yet decided,"" Shah said. Targetting the Congress, he said the only agenda of that party is ""Modi Hatao"" (defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi) in contrast to the PM's goal of ""eradicating poverty and corruption"" from the country. He said the BJP is the only party where an ordinary worker can go on to become a prime minister or a chief minister of a state. ""This is the reason why a tea-seller has become the prime minister of our country... Is this possible in Congress, BSP or SP? The main aim of the opposition parties is to make their sons and daughters an MLA or an MP and there is no place for an ordinary worker to claim these positions,"" he said. Shah said most political parties in the country lacked ""democracy"". ""How can leaders of such parties will protect democracy of the nation?"" he asked. ""In such a scenario, there is no possibility of any development in the country. The Congress ruled for 55 years but failed to usher in development,"" Shah said. Referring to the prime minister's ambitious schemes that are aimed at providing power and toilets in every village of the country, Shah said the Modi government is working hard to fulfil this objective. Before addressing the convention, Shah visited memorials of Rani Lakshmibai and Vijayaraje Scindia, popularly known as 'Rajmata'. The Scindia family had ruled Gwalior state during the pre-independence period. ""Those people who lived for the country can only inspire the youth,"" he said. Referring to the 2016 Uri attack and subsequent surgical strike, Shah said, ""Within 10 days of the attack at (the Army camp in) Uri, Indian soldiers entered Pakistan and killed terrorists"". Shah said Madhya Pradesh was brought out of BIMARU tag and turned into a developed state by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The BJP chief also took potshots at the state Congress which is known to be a divided house. ""The Congress has not yet decided on its chief ministerial face while in the BJP, Shivraj Singh Chouhan will become a chief minister again,"" he said. Similarly, it is not yet clear who will be the Opposition leader in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but Narendra Modi will become prime minister again from the BJP, he said.

Press Trust of India,": BJP president Amit Shah Tuesday said ""illegal infiltrators"" took away jobs of youths in the country and alleged that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and other opposition parties had opposed the NRC when 40 lakh such settlers were identified under the exercise. Addressing a convention of BJP workers at Polo Ground in Shivpuri, Shah said the BJP governments would ""drive each and every infiltrator out of the country"" after winning elections in 2018 and 2019. Taking a dig at Gandhi, Shah said he should ""stop daydreaming"" about the Congress coming to power after elections. Referring to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam, he said the BJP government would drive each of the 40 lakh ""illegal infiltrators"" out of the country as the party stands for national security and rights of Indians. ""When the NRC identified 40 lakh illegal migrants in Assam, Rahul baba and parties like the SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Trinmool Congress (TMC) raised a hue and cry and opposed the exercise,"" Shah said. He said the youths of the country lost their jobs to the illegal immigrants. ""These migrants took away the jobs of our youths. They (opposition parties) lacked concern for our youths and for the hunger of the people of this country. We will drive each infiltrator out after winning elections in 2018 and 2019,"" he said. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in the next two months in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram. While first three of the above states are currently ruled by the BJP, the Congress is in power in the northeastern state. Telangana was ruled by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) before chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dissolved the assembly. Lok Sabha elections are slated to be held next year. ""Rahul Baba should stop daydreaming. The Congress' condition is that it would (soon) be difficult to find them even with the help of binoculars,"" Shah said. He said the Congress lacked any issues with which it could go to the people seeking votes in the Madhya Pradesh polls. ""How can the Congress succeed in winning polls in Madhya Pradesh? Will you seek votes from people with the help of a 'raja' (former chief minister Digvijaya Singh who is an erstwhile royal), a 'maharaja' (former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia who is a royal descendant) and an industrialist (state Congress chief Kamal Nath) who have never seen poverty?"" he questioned. Shah said Madhya Pradesh became a BIMARU state in the rule of the then chief minister Digvijaya Singh, whereas Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan pulled the state out of poverty and turned it into a developed state. Digvijaya Singh had helmed the state between 1993 to 2003. ""The state budget under the then Congress government was only Rs 20,000 crore, which has gone up to Rs 2 lakh crore. The per capita income has also shot up to Rs 80,000 from Rs 15,000. ""Simultaneously, power generation has also increased from 3000 MW to 18000 MW under the BJP rule. During the time of the Congress, people of the state used to receive power supply for only 3 to 5 hours everyday,"" the BJP chief claimed. Turning to Rahul Gandhi, Shah said the Congress chief had ""insulted"" jawans by asking for evidence of surgical strike conducted by the Army on terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in 2016. ""During the Congress regime, Pakistan used to threaten India. Our government taught a lesson to Pakistan through the surgical strike. But Rahul baba was asking for the proof,"" Shah claimed. ""After our government conducted the surgical strike, even mediapersons who used to talk about 'Mauni Baba' (a jibe the BJP uses to attack former PM Manmohan Singh) became silent,"" Shah said. He claimed that before the surgical operation, the US and Israel were the only countries known to avenge death of their soldiers, but the prime minister added India's name to the list. Shah announced that the BJP-led governments across the country would celebrate the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founder members of the BJP. Before addressing the convention, Shah garlanded statue of Tatya Tope, a general in the 1857 rebellion against the British, at Shivpuri and recalled his contribution. After addressing BJP workers, Shah travelled to Guna, around 90 kms from Shivpuri, where he held a roadshow, after offering prayers at a Hanuman temple.

FP Staff,"As the MeToo fire rages on, charring reputations as more women narrate their experiences of unsolicited sexual behaviour with Union minister MJ Akbar and actor Alok Nath among those named for their alleged actions, Congress demanded the resignation of the junior minister of State in the Ministry of External Affairs. What could add to the turmoil for the minister, Akbar faces accusations from more than one woman as his once illustrious career as a journalist now nearly stand on the verge of demolition. Congress leader and former Union minister Jaipal Reddy, at a press conference, said, ""MJ Akbar has his own stature of being a veteran journalist in addition to being junior minister with the External Affairs Ministry. Sushma Swaraj could not comment on her own subordinate. Akbar should either come out with a satisfactory explanation or he must resign from his post in the government. We demand an enquiry into these allegations. If Justice Brett Kavanaugh can be asked for an explanation then why not MJ Akbar who allegedly did whatever he did much later in his life than Kavanaugh."" While women from across the media have flooded social media with harrowing stories of their encounter, politicians, Union ministers and leaders of ruling parties had maintained a stoic silence, except Maneka Gandhi. Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Maneka, is the only BJP leader who, so far, has openly reacted to the stream of survivors' accounts, naming prominent personalities, pouring out on social media. Though the minister did not explicitly react to allegations against Akbar, she did assert that the survivors' voice should not be questioned and a probe should be carried out in such cases. Maneka spoke to   after the accusations against Akbar, and others, made headlines: ""There should be an investigation. Those who are in positions of power always use it, whether it is film, media or industry. Whenever women make such allegations, we should take them very seriously,"" she said. ""Women are scared of speaking out thinking people will make fun of them or question their character. Now that women are speaking up we should take action on each and every allegation,"" she added while responding to a questions specifically about a ""big politician"" named in multiple survivors' accounts. Women began to share their encounters with Akbar after journalist Priya Ramani re-plugged her article in   from October 2017. Written after a string of women accused Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, Priya wrote about her experience with Akbar, but did not name him. In the   article, Ramani said that Akbar had invited her to a hotel room in Mumbai for an interview and made uncomfortable advances towards her. She was 23 years old, while he was 43. “I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story. Never named him because he didn’t ‘do’ anything. Lots of women have worse stories about this predator — maybe they’ll share.""    Soon after Ramani shared her tweet, a number of women retweeted and shared their own encounters with Akbar, accusing him of making them feel uncomfortable by calling them to his hotel rooms for interviews, inviting himself to their houses with a bottle of alcohol to even turning up at their houses ""for coffee"". Even as this latest addition to the #MeToo movement took over headlines, Sushma on Tuesday refused to respond when she was asked whether there would be an “internal investigation” into the allegations against Akbar.   and   reporters yell out to her, reminding her that she is a ""woman minister"", and ask her what action she would take against Akbar, but Sushma chooses to stay mum. Even as Sushma refused to comment on the allegations against Akbar, Congress national spokesperson Manish Tewari said the case dates back to when Akbar was a journalist, not a political leader. ""MJ should come up and speak on this. The prime minister should speak on the allegations against his minister,"" he said. ""The minister concerned (Akbar) should speak up. Silence cannot be a way out. It's an extremely serious matter and should be investigated.""

A journalist quoted Ramani’s tweet, saying, “So many of us have an MJ story.”  Another Twitter user, who had tweeted her experience with a ""brilliant, flamboyant editor who dabbled in politics"" on Sunday, revealed on Tuesday that it was Akbar who had called her to his his hotel room to ""discuss work"" and ""made life at work hell"" when she refused his advances"". Another Twitter user said she had gone through an experience with Akbar similar to Ramani's at a hotel in Kolkata in 1995, after which she declined the job offer. “I must clarify, however, that he didn't actually ‘do’ anything. But the whole experience of an interview sitting on a bed in a hotel room followed by an invitation to come over for a drink that evening was rattling and deeply uncomfortable,” she wrote.

""The alliance partners have been called for a meeting by the chief minister in Delhi on 12 October at AIIMS where he is admitted,"" a senior official in the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) told  . During the meeting, Parrikar would discuss ""matters related to the state's governance,"" he said. Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) leader Sudin Dhavalikar, Goa Forward Party (GFP) leader Vijai Sardesai and Independent MLAs Govind Gawade, Rohan Khaunte and Prasad Gaonkar, who are supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led alliance in Goa, have been invited for the meeting, the official said. ""I have been invited for the meeting with the chief minister in Delhi on 12 October. I don't know who else is invited,"" Gawade said, adding that he has not been informed about the meeting's agenda. This would be the first formal meeting chaired by Parrikar since his admission to the AIIMS last month. Highly placed sources said Parrikar is likely to distribute additional portfolios to his Cabinet ministers during this week. ""A discussion is likely in the meeting about portfolios to be distributed to the allies,"" a source said. BJP president Amit Shah had last month said Parrikar would continue as the chief minister and that there would be reshuffle of his Cabinet soon. Later, two ailing ministers Francis D'Souza and Pandurang Madkaikar were dropped from the Goa Cabinet and they were replaced with Milind Naik and Nilesh Cabral. Questions over the stability of the government have been raised by the Opposition Congress because of Parrikar's illness. Goa deputy speaker and BJP MLA Michael Lobo said last Friday that the state administration has ""totally collapsed"" because of the absence of Parrikar and people were praying for his early recovery. The MGP, a key ally in Goa's ruling BJP-led coalition, last Wednesday dismissed questions over the stability of Parrikar government but expressed readiness to face mid-term polls in case the Assembly is dissolved. The BJP, which has 14 MLAs in the 40-member Assembly, is ruling the state with the help of the MGP, the GFP, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and three Independents.

FP Staff,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of initiating Income Tax Department   in connection with an alleged case of tax evasion. At a press conference called after I-T sleuths raided 16 properties with links to Gahlot, AAP spokesperson Atishi told reporters that the Centre was blatantly using internal agencies, such as the I-T Department, Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Delhi Police, to intimidate AAP. ""We must be one of the only political parties in India whose funding comes solely through donations, and also one of the few that receives an income tax notice every day,"" she said. The AAP spokesperson alleged that the BJP was attacking Gahlot only to hinder the party's political progress. She emphasised that Gahlot was being targeted because he was leading the legal battle over the disqualification of 20 AAP parliamentary secretaries. Referring to their disqualification as ""unconstitutional"" and ""illegal"", Atishi said: ""The central government has tried, time and time, again to disqualify our parliamentary secretaries and have a bid for re-election. However, Gahlot's persistence in the case has prevented them from doing so."" She also said that the BJP wants to block the Delhi government's doorstep delivery of services, where, too, Gahlot is at the forefront. The Arvind Kejriwal government had launched the scheme last month, wherein 40 government services can be home-delivered for Rs 50. Launched in association with a private agency, it envisages a ""mobile  "" visiting homes for a nominal fee to help people avail of these services. Kejriwal, too, reacted to the I-T raids on Gahlot, calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to comment on the earlier raids that were conducted on him and Satyendra Jain, Delhi's health and power minister. The CBI had raided Kejriwal's house in Delhi's Civil Lines area in February to collect evidence related to an alleged assault on Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash by AAP MLAs.

FP Staff,"Around 30 percent voting was recorded in the second phase of the municipal body elections in Jammu and Kashmir. In the first six hours of   on Wednesday, 34 percent voting was registered. About 2 percent of the electorate voted in the first five hours of polling in 49 wards of urban local bodies in the militancy-wracked Kashmir Valley, where elections are being held amid tight security, officials said. The urban local body elections, covering 79 municipal bodies with an electorate of about 17 lakh,   in Jammu and Kashmir four phases. Voting for the second phase of the polls in the Valley began at 6 am and ended at 4 pm on Wednesday. People voted amid stringent security arrangements at 544 polling stations across the state. Opposition parties in Jammu and Kashmir saw the decision of the chief electoral officer to open polling at 6 am as an attempt to rig the elections. National Conference leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted that this may have been done to discourage journalists from checking the veracity of the polls. State Congress vice-president GN Monga also said this was another attempt to rig the civic elections. The polling timing for the second phase of the civic elections was modified from 7 am to 6 am, and the voting was scheduled for 10 hours. Election officials said this was done to ensure a better turnout. ""Only 1.8 percent of the 2.20 lakh electorate cast their votes in the first five hours,"" an official said. In five districts of Kashmir, 6.28 percent voting was recorded, with Anantnag registering just 0.8 percent voting till 12 pm. The Sumbal Municipal Body in Bandipora district saw a considerable rise in voting. By 12 pm, 22.2 percent votes were cast in this municipality, an improvement from the 3.4 percent registered in the first phase. The Sumbal Municipal Body falls in the Sonwari Assembly constituency, which is represented by National Conference MLA and former minister Akbar Lone. During the 2014 Assembly elections, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Yaseer Rishi lost to Lone by a margin of 406 votes. Polling in the second phase was brisker in the whole of Bandipora district, with 17.4 percent of 8,300 voters casting their ballots till 11 am, an official said. The poll percentage in north Kashmir's Sopore and south Kashmir's Anantnag municipal areas was 2.3 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. In the second phase of the the urban local body polls, over a thousand candidates — 881 in the Jammu division and 148 in the Kashmir division — were in the fray for 263 municipal wards in both the divisions. As many as 69 wards in the Valley were won uncontested. A total of 3,372 nominations have been filed for the 1,145 wards being contested across the state. The next two phases of the elections will be held on 13 and 16 October. Despite Opposition and arguments that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir was not conducive to hold elections, the state announced the dates for the urban local body polls last month. Two major political parties — the National Conference and the PDP — boycotted the elections, accusing the Centre of not taking a firm stand on protecting Article 35A of the Constitution, which is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court. Militants have issued threats to anyone participating in these polls, because of which the state saw sparse campaigning by candidates. Two National Conference workers were killed last week.

The announcement comes after the Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a report from the Centre on the details of the decision-making process involved in finalising the Rafale deal with France. The three-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph gave the order without issuing a notice to the Centre,   reported. Prior to the apex court's statement, the Centre called the PILs filed in the matter 'politically motivated.' In the PIL, the petitioner, lawyer Vineet Dhanda, had sought a direction to the Centre to reveal details of the agreement and comparative prices agreed upon during the tenures of both the United Progressive Alliance and the incumbent National Democratic Alliance. The bench heard another PIL by lawyer ML Sharma, who had sought to have the hearing adjourned till Wednesday  . In his petition, Sharma alleged discrepancies in the fighter jet deal with France and sought a stay on it. His petition says that the inter-government agreement to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets must be quashed as it was an ""outcome of corruption"" and not ratified by Parliament under Article 253 of the Constitution, as per which, Parliament has the power to make any law to implement any inter-government agreement. Sharma, on Wednesday, made submissions on the loss the State exchequer had incurred because of the contract on the fighter aircraft and the higher price paid for each unit. He also made arguments on the history of the deal. Representing the Centre, Attorney General of India KK Venugopal said the matter cannot be examined judicially as it was ""about national security"" and urged the Supreme Court to not entertain such petitions. ""If a notice is issued, it will go to the prime minister, etc. This is a political petition, not a public interest litigation, and is part of a bitter fight going on between the ruling and Opposition party.

After meeting JDS leaders late on Tuesday night, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal said both the parties would conduct a joint campaign and fight the polls to defeat the BJP.

Press Trust of India,"The Election Commission's (EC) decision to hold by-elections to three Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka on 3 November has come as a surprise to most political parties who questioned the necessity for the exercise in view of the general elections due early next year. Pointing to the short term of about five months those elected in the by-poll would have, Congress and BJP said the Lok Sabha elections would be held within five months. EC had on Saturday announced that by-polls to Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya and Ramanagara and Jamkhandi Assembly constituencies will take place on 3 November. The 
counting of votes will be on 6 November. The by-elections had been necessitated after BJPs BS Yeddyurappa (Shivamogga) and B Sriramalu (Ballari), and CS Puttaraju of Janata Dal (Secular) (Mandya) resigned as MPs on their election to the Assembly in last May. By-polls to Jamkhandi Assembly seat was necessitated following the death of Congress MLA Siddu Nyamagouda, while Ramanagara fell vacant as Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy gave up the seat and retained Channapatna, the other segment won by him in the Assembly elections. The parties welcomed the by-election to the Assembly constituencies and said they would finalise their candidates even as JDS, heading the coalition government with Congress, appeared all set to field Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha in Ramanagara seat. On a visit to Ramanagara on Sunday, Anitha herself said she would contest from the segment. Responding to questions from reporters, initially she indicated she would contest and asked them to wait for two days for official announcement. However, faced with persistent questions, she said her candidature had been confirmed. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Dinesh Gundu Rao said on Saturday they were expecting the Assembly by-polls because it was necessary since the House still has a term of four-and-half years, but questioned the need for holding elections to the three Lok Sabha seats.

Praveen Swami,"His cigarette-lighter looked like it had been born from a nightmare in Guangzhou or Ningbo, a gold-plated box that spat out light in a dozen improbable colours, and a tinny rendition of You Light Up My Life. Javed Shah, police constable-turned jihadist-turned pro-India militia commander-turned prospective Member of Parliament, twirled the lighter obsessively. The pious had their prayer beads; the rich the brands out of Dubai’s malls: this was Shah’s own coat of arms. It was 1996 and India was a holding a Lok Sabha election in Jammu and Kashmir after nine war-torn years. Levels of violence were high: 967 civilians, 785 terrorists, and 164 security force personnel had been killed the previous year in Kashmir, orders of magnitude higher than today. The National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir’s largest political party, had refused to contest. Empty polling stations and streets silenced by curfews marked   on Monday — a strange simulacrum of democracy that seemed designed to illustrate how little more than a decade of democracy has achieved. But the elections are part of New Delhi’s long game in Kashmir — and could have fateful consequences. If that game works, this might come to be remembered as the time Kashmir’s fractured polity began to rebuild itself. Few thought, in 1996, that elections would achieve anything. In some places, the security forces had to corral terrified voters to polling stations, using force to beat-back the impact of jihadist violence. Notably, however, voter turnout was low in some areas where intense coercion was alleged, like Anantnag and Sopore. It was, conversely, high in others where there appeared to be no sign of state pressure to participate in the elections. Politicians read the signs correctly: after years of direct central rule, a large mass of people within Jammu and Kashmir wanted a representative political order sensitive to their everyday concerns. Later that year, elections to the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly brought a National Conference government, led by Farooq Abdullah. The National Conference picked up 37.98 per cent of the popular vote in the seats it contested, and 57 of 81 seats. New Delhi promptly threw figures like Shah — the detritus of its brutal counter-insurgency programme — under the bus, and backed the old political establishment. From 1999, former spymaster Amarjit Dulat set about reviving the political system. His most notable achievement was the creation the People’s Democratic Party—a new iteration of the Opposition Muslim United Front, which once included secessionists like Abdul Gani Lone and the Jama’at-e-Islami. Helped along by the Research and Analysis Wing, the PDP emerged as a major force, eating into the jihadist constituency. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government, hoping to draw back the secessionists into the political space they occupied until 1987, also held a series of secret meetings with secessionist leaders like Yasin Malik and Sajjad Lone. Twinned with this, diplomats Satinder Lambah and Tariq Aziz engaged in a covert dialogue aimed at hammering out a final-status deal on Kashmir. “I think the agenda is pretty much set,” secessionist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said in April 2007. “It is September 2007”, he went on, “that India and Pakistan are looking at, in terms of announcing something on Kashmir.” Jammu and Kashmir was back to where it had been in 1987. The new order, New Delhi hoped, would be able to reconstruct the systems of patronage and influence which had sustained mainstream politics in the state prior to 1988–1989. It worked: but that, it has turned out, wasn’t a good thing. For one, many of the leaders who emerged on Kashmir’s landscape—from former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti to Sajjad Lone or the Mirwaiz—were in politics mainly because they were children of prominent pre-1987 figures. Few had built an independent political constituency or cadre during the years that had passed. Perhaps more important, the leadership showed little ability to move beyond handing out of government contracts and jobs to their faithful. This pre-1987 politics offered nothing to a youth cohort that had grown up amid violence and despair. Like people in many parts of India, Kashmir’s youth found democracy did not mean access to the networks needed for entrepreneurship; that large family spending in education did not guarantee an income at an age their parents had families. From 2006, a new generation of Islamist leaders—Masarat Alam Bhat, his colleague Asiya Andrabi, and their jailed mentor Ashiq Hussain Faktoo—succeeded in capitalising on the anger. The New Islamists cast the political order as agents of a malign, Hindu-chauvinist entity determined to destroy Kashmir’s religious and cultural identity. In its place, they promised a utopia based on Islam. Engulfed by the rage which erupted after the killing of jihadist leader Burhan Wani, mobs burnt down a state-of-the-art dwarf apple orchard owned by well-connected entrepreneur Khurram Mir, cars and homes. The targets tell us something important about the social tensions that underlie youth rage in Kashmir. The New Islamists gave voice to this rage—under the benign watch of the political establishment which hoped to buttress its religious credentials. In 2008, the tensions exploded after the government’s grant of land-use rights to the Amarnath shrine board, a crisis that broke the People’s Democratic Party-Congress alliance government, and cracked apart the effort to rebuild a cosy political order. The violence has continued since, with both the National Conference and PDP failing to contain it. For politics to heal Kashmir’s wounds, it must give the people of the region new ways to imagine their relationship with themselves, and with India. That, however, requires a leadership which has earned legitimacy by transforming the lives of citizens. The village and town-level politicians who emerge from that process might just prove to be the building blocks of that new order.",2018-10-08,"Amarjit Dulat,Burhan Wani,Civic Election In J&K,Civic Polls,Civic Polls In Jammu And Kashmir,CriticalPoint,Election In Jammu And Kashmir,J&K Municipal Elections,Jammu And Kashmir,Kashmir Conflict,Militancy,NC,PDP,RAW","Civic polls in Jammu and Kashmir offer chance to rebuild state's polity, help Valley re-imagine ties with India",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/civic-polls-in-jammu-and-kashmir-offer-opportunity-to-rebuild-states-polity-help-valley-residents-re-imagine-ties-with-india-5340121.html,firstpost,-1,0
Ishfaq Naseem,"The Kashmir Valley witnessed an   in the first phase of the municipal elections. The polls on Monday were held in six districts in the region amid a complete shutdown, observed in response to the call of separatists to boycott the urban local body elections, the first to be held in the state in 13 years. Polling booths were deserted in most parts of Kashmir, besides Kupwara district, where the percentage of votes cast was in double digits. Voters chose to boycott the elections and observed a shutdown called by the Joint Resistance Leadership, a conglomerate of various separatist organisations in the state.  at 7 am and did not pick up over the day. Given the low turnout, the Chief Electoral Officer decided to keep the booths open for two additional hours, as a result of which voting continued for nine hours in the 57 wards in the Valley. By 1 pm, the four municipal wards of Anantnag in Kashmir recorded a polling percentage of 6.1 percent, while it was only 12 percent at a single polling station in Budgam. The turnout at the 16 wards of Bandipora was 2.5 percent, 3.7 percent in the 15 wards of Baramulla, 26.3 percent in the 18 wards of Kupwara and 3 percent in the three wards of the Srinagar Municipal Corporation. Two hours later, the polling percentage was 6.8 percent, 12.9 percent, 3 percent, 4.5 percent, 29.8 percent and 5.9 percent in the districts of Anantnag, Budgam, Bandipora, Baramulla, Kupwara and Srinagar, respectively. When voting ended at 4 pm, the total count was 11 percent; in the districts of Anantnag, Budgam, Bandipora , Baramulla, Kupwara and Srinagar, it was 7.3 percent, 17 percent, 3.4 percent, 5.1 percent, 32.3 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively. The run-up to the elections was marked by lack of campaigning, as people remained unaware about the candidates contesting the local body polls, and political parties being unable to find nominees to field for several seats. In many wards, neither the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nor the Congress could field candidates, even though no militant attacks were reported in these regions for the past few years. Many of the candidates also shifted from their homes to government accommodations in Srinagar city. In the whole of Budgam district in Kashmir, polling was held only at one booth as candidates had  , or election authorities did not receive the nominations before the deadline to submit the papers. In Budgam, 33 wards were to go for the polls, but only 26 candidates had filed their nomination papers, of whom 24 were declared as elected unopposed. This was the one ward where both the BJP and Congress had fielded candidates for the civic polls. Additional Deputy Commissioner (Budgam) Khurshid Ahmad Sanai said that only one polling station was set up in the entire district. ""The elections were held only at ward no. 5 in Budgam municipality. We had set up only one polling station, and the total number of allotted votes was 642. As per the Election Commission of India's guidelines, there has to be one polling station for 1,200 voters,"" he said. ""The elections were to be held for three municipal committees of Budgam, Chadoora and Srinagar, and there were 13 wards each for Budgam and Chadoora and seven for Khansaheb. There were three vacant wards in Budgam and five in Chadoora, while all seven candidates were declared as elected unopposed from Khansaheb,"" he added. However, in the border district of Kupwara, the polling percentage was relatively higher. In the first three hours of voting in Kupwara, over 1,000 votes were cast at 18 wards, where 47 candidates were in the electoral fray. Deputy Commissioner (Kupwara) Khalid Jehangir said ""a good percentage of people came to cast their votes in the district"". In the urban local body elections, while the BJP could not find candidates for a number of wards, it nevertheless made inroads in Kashmir for the first time in the electoral history of the state. Party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said that their 80 candidates were elected unopposed in Kashmir. Both major regional parties — the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference — boycotted the polls in protest against the central government's move to ""revoke Article 35A of Indian Constitution, which bars outsiders from owning properties in Kashmir, among other provisions.

Moreover, despite the low voter turnout and lack of candidates, Jammu and Kashmir Congress vice president GN Monga accused the BJP of rigging the elections. He said the saffron party was using the ""official machinery"" to mobilise voters and was ""openly using muscle and money power to influence the elections"".

Press Trust of India,"The Congress is likely to unseat the BJP from power in Rajasthan, two opinion polls have predicted in what could be a continuation of the state's tradition of over two decades of voting out the ruling party. Surveys carried out by   and   have given the Congress almost 50 percent of the vote share and 142 and 124-138 seats respectively in the 200-member Rajasthan Assembly, with its state president Sachin Pilot leading Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje as the most preferred candidate for the top post. While the   survey is restricted to Rajasthan, the   opinion poll has also predicted the outcome of the Assembly elections in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, giving an edge to the Congress in both the states. The BJP is in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for 15 years. The pre-poll survey has, however, added that a minor swing in both the states can turn the tide in the favour of either of the two main parties due to a very small difference between their projected vote shares. It has predicted 122 seats for the Congress in the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly and 47 seats for the Opposition party in the 90-member Chhattisgarh Assembly. The BJP has been projected to bag 108 and 40 seats in these two states respectively. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had on Saturday expressed confidence that it would register a ""record victory"" in the upcoming state Assembly elections and retain power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Senior BJP leader and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said the saffron party would secure a record victory on the basis of its hard work and development measures, besides the performance of its governments in the three states. In Rajasthan, Pilot leads Raje as the popular choice for the chief minister's post with 36 percent voters preferring him, while the latter is the first choice for 27 percent, according to the   poll, which says former chief minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot enjoys the backing of 24 percent voters. The   poll says Pilot, Gehlot and Raje are the first choice of 32, 27 and 23 percent voters respectively. However, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Raman Singh are the first choice of the voters for the hot seat, despite anti-incumbency sentiments against their governments, the   poll says. The Congress and the BJP have been predicted to bag 42.2 and 41.5 percent votes in Madhya Pradesh and 38.9 and 38.2 percent votes in Chhattisgarh respectively. There is, however, a huge gap in the projected vote share of the Congress and the BJP in Rajasthan, with the Opposition party being backed by 49.9 percent voters against the 34.3 percent share for the ruling dispensation. The vote share predicted by   is 50 and 43 percent for the Congress and the BJP respectively in Rajasthan. The BJP had secured power in all the three states in 2013 by winning 165, 142 and 49 seats in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh respectively as against the 58, 21 and 39 seats of the Congress.

FP Staff,"Juxtaposing the polling pattern in the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir in the state going by the same name on Monday provided an emphatic picture of contrast. While poll booths in Jammu saw voters enthusiastically participating in the electoral exercise for forming new civic bodies, most of their counterparts Kashmir preferred to stay away from the voting kiosks owing to threats from terrorists and separatists despite the extraordinary security cover provided by thousands of security personnel. Notwithstanding the zest shown by voters in Jammu to vote, the indifference in Kashmir towards the democratic process ensured that the voter turnout was a poor one in the urban local body elections when calculated for the whole state in its entirety. About six percent of the electorate voted in the first six hours of polling in 83 wards of urban local bodies in militancy-wracked Kashmir Valley, where elections are being held amid tight security, officials said. Voting for the first of the four-phased elections in the Valley began at 7 am and ended at 4 pm. Polling was brisker in north Kashmir with more than 29 percent of 4,700 voters casting their votes in the first two hours for Kupwara Municipal Committee, followed by 21 percent in Handwara town, the official said. The poll percentage in Bandipora, Baramulla, Anantnag and Budgam municipal areas was around five percent. Polling is being held for only 83 wards in the Valley as 69 wards have been won uncontested. Of the 150 polling stations in the Kashmir division, 138 are categorised hypersensitive. Brisk voting was seen in almost all the wards in Jammu region with Rajouri registering the highest votes while Srinagar in the Valley saw the lowest as a shutdown-call led to subdued polling in the municipal elections that are taking place after 13 years in Jammu and Kashmir. Amid tight security, long queues of enthusiastic voters were seen in almost all the municipal corporation and municipal committee wards in Jammu district where 34 percent polling was recorded in five hours, as Rajouri registered 55 percent and Poonch 47. Voting continued peacefully in Gandhi Nagar, RS Pura, Bishnah, Arnia, Khour, Jurian, Akhnoor, Nowshera, Surankote and Kalakote areas and many other wards. Srinagar registered the lowest count of 3.5 percent in five hours since polling began at 7 am. In the three Srinagar municipal corporation wards of Humhama, Bagh-e-Mehtab and Hamdania colony, 1,001 votes were polled till 11.30 am. In the Ladakh region where biting cold had kept early voters away, saw the process pick up and Kargil district registered 3,470 votes while Leh had 3,164 votes till 11.30 am. A presiding officer was suspended at the Aloosa polling station in Bandipora district for allowing a woman to accompany a voter to the voting counter. Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said no restrictions have been imposed anywhere in the valley although security has been tightened to provide a free and fair environment. No militancy related incident has been reported from anywhere in the valley so far. A mock poll has been conducted at all 584 polling stations. There were defaults in EVMs at four places. Those EVMs were immediately replaced. This time, a large number of independent candidates are also in the fray. This municipal election is also witnessing two significant firsts. In a major development, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are being used for the first time in accordance with the rules that have been amended in 2016. In another first, the ECI is providing voting facilities to Kashmiri migrants by means of postal ballots. Since the migrants continue to be enrolled in their respective assembly constituencies from which the municipal committees or panchayats would derive the rolls, facilities will be provided for them to vote. The urban local body polls were announced in September. Two major political parties — the National Conference and the PDP — have boycotted the elections accusing the Centre of not taking a firm stand on the protection of Article 35A of the Constitution, which is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court. Militants have issued threats to anyone participating in these polls, resulting in absence of any campaigning by the candidates. Two National Conference workers were killed last week. In dozens of wards, especially in south Kashmir, no candidate filed nomination papers. Candidates who are contesting have been moved to safe locations and their details have not been made public. All candidates have been provided with either cluster security in hotels or individually in the Valley. In the wake of the polls, mobile internet services have been suspended in South Kashmir, while mobile internet speed has been reduced to 2G in other parts of the Valley. Around 85,000 voters, including 40,800 women, are eligible to vote in the Valley. Of the 30,074 voters in three wards of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, 1,500 turned up to exercise their franchise at the heavily fortified polling stations. Elections are being held in 422 of the state's 1,145 municipal wards. As many as 1,204 candidates are in the fray for the four-phased municipal polls that will end on 16 October.

Press Trust of India," Karnataka BJP president BS Yeddyurappa Monday rubbished reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the state, terming it ""far from the truth"". He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates for the 3 November Assembly and Parliamentary by-polls in the state will be finalised at the party's core committee meeting on Wednesday. ""All this is far from the truth, unnecessarily such news is being spread. There is no substance in it,"" the former chief minister told reporters in response to a question about Modi contesting from Karnataka. There were reports in certain sections of the local media that with an aim to increase BJP's influence in the South, Modi was likely to contest from one of the southern states, most probably from Karnataka along with Varanasi, the seat that he currently represents. BJP is presently not in power in any of the south Indian states. Karnataka is the only state where the party has considerable presence and has had its government in the past. Yeddyurappa, who has been meeting several party leaders regarding finalising candidates for the Lok Sabha and Assembly by-election, said it would be finalised by Wednesday. ""Day after tomorrow (Wednesday) evening, we have called a core committee meeting where we will finalise our candidates for the three Lok Sabha constituencies and two Vidhan Sabha constituencies and send it to our national president for approval,"" he said. Discussions have taken place about candidates for almost all constituencies that would go for the by-polls, the BJP leader said, adding, ""We will hold further discussions on Monday and Tuesday before finalising the names"". The Election Commission on Saturday had announced the bye-elections in three Lok Sabha constituencies (Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya) and two assembly constituencies (Ramanagara and Jamkhandi). The elections will be held on 3 November and counting of votes will take place on 6 November. The by-elections had been necessitated after BJP's BS Yeddyurappa (Shivamogga) and B Sriramalu (Ballari), and CS Puttaraju of JD(S) (Mandya) resigned as MPs on their election to the Assembly in May last.

Deputy Commissioner of Kupwara, Khalid Jehangir, said that the response of voters to the elections was good. Officials said adequate security has been put in place and no untoward incident was reported. Contrary to the Kashmir valley, where voters have shied away from coming to the polling booths, enthusiasm is being witnessed among the electorate in Jammu where long queues of voters are being witnessed since morning. Due to security reasons, mobile internet services have been suspended by the local administration in the South Kashmir region and some areas of North Kashmir but there is no formal order yet. In other parts of the valley, the internet speed has been reduced to 2G.

Press Trust of India," The Congress and the Election Commission on Monday sparred in the Supreme Court over the pleas by two senior Congress leaders alleging duplication of names in the voters' lists for the upcoming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. A bench comprising Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan reserved its verdict after it concluded the hearing of the pleas during which senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Vikas Singh traded charges over conduct of the polls. Sibal is representing Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Sachin Pilot while Singh is the counsel for the Election Commission of India (ECI). The two leaders also sought random verification of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines in the two states. Singh said attempts have been made to malign an important constitutional institution like the Election Commission and get favourable order by fabricating documents by alleging discrepancies in voters' lists. ""I stand by what I had said earlier,"" the senior lawyer said, adding the poll panel had taken note of the allegations of the Congress party and undertaken corrective measures with regard to discrepancies in the voters list which was evident from the EC's communication of 8 June this year. Despite this, the Congress party alleged discrepancies in their petition in September and this was a clear attempt to malign the institution, he said, adding the leaders have ""casually filed something"" to ""malign"" and ""denigrate"" the poll panel. Observing that free and fair polls is the ""essence of democracy"", Sibal strongly rebutted the submissions of the poll panel and referred to alleged discrepancies and duplication in the voters list, giving illustrations of four assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh. Giving an illustration, Sibal said 36 voters have different details, but their photographs are the same and this assumed significance against the backdrop of 60 lakh fake voters having been found in Madhya Pradesh alone. Also, 24 lakh names have been deleted from the list by the poll panel, he alleged. The plea filed by Nath through advocate Varun Chopra said directions should be issued to publish the voters list in a ""text format as per rules"", instead of the PDF format and expeditious decisions be taken on all complaints before its final publication. Nath also said a direction should be issued to the poll panel to randomly verify VVPAT slips with Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes at 10 percent of randomly selected polling stations in every constituency. On 18 September, the poll panel in its affidavit justified providing the draft electoral rolls in PDF format in Madhya Pradesh without any pictures of voters and said it was done to prevent manipulation of the electors’ data. It had sought dismissal of the petition filed by Nath alleging duplication of names in the voters list as ""not maintainable"", ""completely frivolous"" and ""an abuse of the process of court"". Earlier, the top court had agreed to examine the pleas of Nath and Pilot and had sought response of the ECI and state poll panels of the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It was alleged that as per a survey, in Madhya Pradesh there were over 60 lakh fake voters and similarly, in Rajasthan, there were over 41 lakh duplicate voters. In Rajasthan, the poll panels have added 71 lakh new voters, the plea said, adding that directions be given to remove inconsistencies and conduct free and fair elections.",2018-10-09,"Congress,EC,Election Commission Of India,India,Justice AK Sikri,Justice Ashok Bhushan,Kamal Nath,Kapil Sibal,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Polls,NewsTracker,Rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Polls,Sachin Pilot,Supreme Court,Vikas Singh,Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)","SC reserves verdict on Congress, EC conflict over alleged duplication of names in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan voters' lists",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sc-reserves-verdict-on-congress-ec-conflict-over-alleged-duplication-of-names-in-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-voters-lists-5342861.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," RJD chief Lalu Yadav's eldest daughter Misa Bharti on Monday acknowledged the ""rift"" between her two brothers — Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav but later clarified that despite all differences, the party was a ""big family"". Latching onto her statement, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that Bharti's admittance of infighting in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) would lead to the collapse of the party and its dynasty politics. Addressing party workers in Maner on the outskirts of Patna, Bharti asked them to give up bickering and stay united. ""Even our family has witnessed a rift between two brothers but where do differences not come up? Five fingers of our hands are not equal. But the RJD is like a big family,"" Bharti said. ""We are not lacking in the support base. The challenge is to keep our flock together,"" she added. However, Bharti later claimed that her call for unity among party workers was presented in a distorted manner. Taking to Twitter she said: ""My appeal to party workers to forget their differences and unite in the larger interest of the party is being distorted and presented out of context,"" she tweeted. Maner falls in the Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat from where Bharti had made an unsuccessful electoral debut in 2014. She got elected to the Rajya Sabha later. Bharti further warned that no ""back-stabbing"" will be tolerated by any member of the party. ""The time has come for you all to give up small differences and brace for the bigger challenges and do not give our opponents a chance to exploit the situation,"" she said. State BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, ""Misa Bharti has admitted what we all know. The RJD will crumble because of the infighting within the family that controls the party."" ""The BJP has been fighting against the politics of dynastic rule and corruption. The RJD embodies these evils and it will meet its fate"", Anand said. Said to be a favourite of Lalu Prasad, Tejashwi was appointed the deputy chief minister of Bihar while the elder brother Tej Pratap was given a cabinet berth, after the Grand Alliance of which RJD was a part won the 2015 assembly polls in which the brothers made their electoral debut. At present, Tejashwi-- viewed as more suave and savvy among the two brothers, is the leader of the opposition in the state assembly.

Rayan Naqash,"On Monday, as Jammu and Kashmir underwent the first phase of municipal elections, the voter turnout in the Kashmir region was 8.3 percent as compared to 80.95 percent in the Jammu region. While voting crossed the 10 percent mark in only two districts in Kashmir — Kupwara in the northern part and Budgam in the central part — the Jammu and Ladakh districts saw more than 50 percent turnout, the highest being in Rajouri (81 percent). “We have come out to strengthen democracy,” said Bashir Ahmad Mir, a municipal candidate contesting on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ticket for Bagh-i-Mehtab ward number 74 in central Kashmir’s Budgam district. Mir said that the voter turnout in his ward was not satisfactory, but at least it was something. By the end of the day, only 9 of the ward’s 859 voters had done their bit to “strengthen democracy,” amid heavy security deployment and a near total shutdown across the Valley. Mir said that that the low turnout was largely due to the security threat posed by militants, who had issued multiple warnings to candidates and voters in the run-up to the polls. Besides, Mir wasn’t contesting in his own locality. A resident of ward 16 in the Humhama area in Budgam, Mir could not contest from there as the seat is reserved for women. “Otherwise, there are 250 people in my locality who would have voted for me,” he claimed. “Now those votes have gone to our candidate from my area.” Mir is confident of his victory. In several such municipal wards across Kashmir, candidates have either won uncontested or were up against one or two other contestants. Several candidates across the Valley will assume their offices unopposed. In the early morning, as voters trickled into the high school at Bemina, on the outskirts of Srinagar, several voters were still unaware of the candidates they were voting for. The secrecy, officials say, was necessary to protect the candidates. Only three days ago, the killing of   in Srinagar had led to apprehensions. Despite the killings, Srinagar saw a turnout of 6.2 percent. Most votes, as usual, had been cast in the first half of the day. At Bemina, tension was palpable as voters attacked journalists at a polling station. The police intervened and prevented matters from escalating. Candidates and party workers said that the boycott of polls by the state’s major regional parties — the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party — had impacted the turnout. Sajjad Lone, chief of the separatist-turned-unionist People’s Conference, termed local polls as “the poor person’s votes”. Speaking to reporters during polling in Handwara, Lone said that if the regional unionist parties were serious, “their MPs and MLAs should resign, boycott their salaries and constituency development funds.” Roads were deserted in north Kashmir’s Handwara town in Kupwara district, which saw a voter turnout of 32.3 percent. By 2.30 pm, polling staff at several booths in the town began preparations to wind up, an hour-and-a-half ahead of closing time. The last elections held in the Valley were the bypolls for the   in April 2017. The election saw widespread violence in the Budgam district, taking the security establishment and observers by surprise. Polling was disrupted by protesters at several booths. On that day, at least nine civilians were killed in firing by security forces. Subsequently, the bypolls for the vacant parliamentary seat of Anantnag were deferred indefinitely. This time around, however, the Valley only witnessed minor instances of stone-pelting. No major militant attack took place, despite repeated warnings by the Hizbul Mujahideen of killings and acid attacks against contestants and voters. Police officials credit this to various preventive measures taken ahead of the polls to prevent a repeat of last year’s events. A senior police official said that the “well-calibrated phasing” of the elections helped reduce the incidence of violence. The official said that instances of pre-poll violence were lower compared to the 2005 municipal and 2011 panchayat polls. “It was probably historically the lowest violence,” he said, adding that this was due to a “well-calibrated plan of action that was executed well on the ground.” The officer further said that the summoning of several persons with “adverse backgrounds” and issuing warnings to them through a magistrate under Section 107 of the CrPC had helped prevent an outbreak of violence. According to him, several such men were warned. The municipal elections being conducted peacefully was “work half-done” as it would lift the security establishment’s spirits, he said. However, according to a political activist in Handwara, the atmosphere of peace was deceptive. “The real test will be in the panchayat elections,” he said. “As it is, militants have a smaller presence in the towns. Things will become serious when villages — where most militants are active — go for polls.",2018-10-08,"BJP,Budgam,ConnectTheDots,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Civic Polls,Militants,National Conference,PDP,Sajjad Lone,Srinagar","Jammu and Kashmir civic election: Valley sees low voter turnout, but polling process remains largely peaceful",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-civic-election-valley-sees-low-voter-turnout-but-polling-process-remains-largely-peaceful-5341311.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar called his Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani on Sunday to express concern about migrants from his state being  . Before calling Rupani, Kumar called Gujarat chief secretary JN Singh to understand the gravity of the situation, and how the state agencies have been dealing with the situation so far. Singh, like Gujarat's director general of police, hails from Bihar. The chief minister of a state calling the chief secretary of another state is unusual, and not in accordance with established protocol. But extraordinary situations demand extraordinary measures. Kumar said that the accused in the rape case must not be spared, but there should be no bias against people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The Bihar chief minister appears to have realised that the social cost of migrant workers returning to the state would be huge. With Lok Sabha elections only six months away, the issue may have a political cost too. The situation is the same for Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Like Kumar, Adityanath also spoke to Rupani on the phone. According to an official statement by the Uttar Pradesh information department, the Gujarat chief minister informed his Uttar Pradesh counterpart that in the last three days, no untoward incident has taken place, and the state agencies will ensure that every single person in the state is safe and allowed to live with dignity. Adityanath said that Gujarat is a peaceful state and a model of development, but those who are opposed to it are trying to vitiate the atmosphere. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from Gujarat, but in 2014, he chose Varanasi as his parliamentary constituency. In a way, he chose Uttar Pradesh as his second home, at least for political purposes. Thus, the situation is tricky for Rupani. He has to deal with popular anger — whether real or manufactured by political rivals — against a person accused of the rape of a minor. He has to ensure that the guilty person is brought to book, while desisting from excessively stringent measures against those who are opposed to migrants from central and eastern India. While the accused has been swiftly arrested, harsh measures against those trying to build up anger against outsiders could breed more anger among locals. That was the reason why the state government was initially soft on such elements. However, this later became a national issue, as images surfaced of migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — mostly working in factories and as street vendors — being forced to flee Gujarat. The migrants were seen boarding overcrowded buses and trains to get back to their native places. The stories of people fleeing the state under threat of violence were disturbing. Despite being in their own country, these people became unwanted elements in a state other than their native one. The election process in Madhya Pradesh has begun. Parliamentary elections will follow soon thereafter. The BJP can ill afford the present scenario. Gujarat minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja has said that he has kept the central government posted about the incidents in the state. Neither Modi nor Amit Shah would like to see the situation spiral out of control. After the initial dilemma on how to deal with the situation, the Gujarat government has decided to crack down on those who were trying to fan divisiveness, regional parochialism and violence. Over   have been made. A senior Gujarat official said that Alpesh Thakor, the Thakor Sena (which is said to be promoted by Alpesh) and some Congress workers were the ones who incited hatred and violence. Though no action has yet been taken against Thakor, some Congress members have been arrested. The BJP national and state leadership is clear that it will not allow a situation similar to that of the Patidar agitation in the state. A senior state BJP leader said that there is one issue at the root of both the Patidar movement and the current situation — jobs. There is a perception that migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh get only those jobs which are not taken by locals. But in the current situation of job-related distress, it is easy for a person or a group to arouse passions against outsiders on the issue. This sentiment also had its role in the current problem. Many people in Gujarat have opposed those who expressed their anger against migrants. It disrupted businesses ahead of the Navratri and Diwali festivities, at a time when production and  businesses of all kinds should have been thriving. Rioting and arson at industrial and business establishments was not what Gujarat was known for. The business community petitioned the government against lawlessness, after which the government cracked down. Law and order has been Gujarat’s USP for the past decade-and-a-half. The unfortunate incident of rape, thus, has come as a rude shock. Incidents of rioting, too, have painted an ugly picture. Most of those arrested have been booked under provisions related to rioting and dacoity. Thus, it will not be easy for them to get bail. The Gujarat home minister and director general of police held a press conference to instill confidence among people in the state and outside. The chief secretary held a video conference with all district magistrates and zonal commissioners. The chief minister told the media about how situation has been contained, and made an appeal to the people of his state.

Press Trust of India,": Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) general secretary Sitaram Yechury hit out at the Congress over its stand on the Sabarimala temple issue, saying it would only help the campaign of the RSS-BJP combine against secular-democratic values. He said while the Congress' central leadership had welcomed the Supreme Court judgment as a progressive step, its Kerala unit had opposed the verdict. Yechury said the Congress' stand could not be accepted by any political party which believed in secular and democratic values. ""The Kerala unit of Congress is opposing the implementation of the verdict and is protesting along with the BJP. By such a stance the Congress is only helping the RSS-BJP combine campaign against secular-democratic values and the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution,"" he told reporters. He alleged the BJP and the RSS opposed the apex court's judgment on the issue and were behind the agitations in Kerala. The CPM had earlier welcomed the verdict on entry of women of all ages to the ancient Kerala shrine, saying the verdict upholds equal rights for women. In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court on 28 September lifted a ban that prevented women and girls between the menstrual age of 10 to 50 from entering the temple, stating the century-old Hindu religious practice was illegal and unconstitutional.

FP Sports," Former champions U-Mumba led for large parts but eventually succumbed to the grit of local rivals Puneri Paltan and settle for an entertaining 32-32 draw in the opening day's second game of the Pro Kabaddi tournament here at the packed Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium on Sunday. After inflicting the only all out of the match in latter stages of the first half, U Mumba pulled away from 20-20 at one stage early on in the second period to lead by two points in the dying seconds of the tie. But a successful raid from Monu followed by the Pune defence hacking down U Mumba's star raider Siddharth Desai to the mat dashed U Mumba's hopes of starting afresh after a dismal previous season where they lost four of their last five matches to miss out from the qualification scenario for the playoffs. Nitin Tomar racked up 15 raid points for Pune while Desai scored one less for U Mumba as both the Maharashtra sides fought tooth and nail till the final whistle in an exhibition of fitness shown by both sets of players. With the result, U Mumba have now failed to get past Pune on five occasions in the last six meetings. There was nothing to choose between teams for much of the first period barring U Mumba inflicting an all out on their local rivals who frittered their three-point lead at one point (9-6) to trail 14-18. However, two successful raids from Nitin Tomar coupled with Siddharth Desai failing to get the better of Pune defence helped Pune end the half at 18-20. Post the breather, Monu helped Pune take the first point with a successful raid. Abhishek Singh faltered for U Mumba to level proceedings at 20-20 but Rohit Baliyan restored his side's lead to two points.

Indo-Asian News Service," The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order on a plea by Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath claiming existence of a large number of duplicate voters in the electoral rolls of the state going to Assembly elections in November. The Congress leader has moved the top court seeking that the voter list be made available in text mode, so that it can be scanned to identify the duplicate votes. He stated that they have already identified about 60 lakh duplicate voters in the state electoral rolls. The Election Commission (EC), however, disputed the contention by Kamal Nath and told the bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan that deletion of 24 lakh votes from the voter list was not done after the Congress brought it to their knowledge but by way of its own exercise of checking the electoral rolls. The Congress had written to the Commission on 3 June about the presence of a large number of duplicate voters in the electoral rolls. Alleging that the Congress leader has relied upon documents which he knows are not correct, senior counsel Vikas Singh, who represented the Election Commission, told the bench that it is a fit case for action under Section 193 of the IPC for intentionally producing false documents. Pressing for an inquiry, Vikas Singh objected to the practice of counsel for the petitioners handing over the documents to the bench across the bar and maligning the Commission. Vikas Singh told the court that the Commission has to move with the law as it progresses and has to take steps to protect the data about voters and ensure that it is not misused. Describing data as the king of the commercial world, Vikas Singh said the details in the voter list concerned people above the age of 18, who are of interest to the business world. The Commission defended its decision not to supply the voters list in text mode, citing voters' right to privacy, and said that it is already making changes in its manual. It said that the manual is for its own in-house procedure and not a statutory rules that can be interpreted. Earlier, the EC had told the top court that allegations about the presence of large-scale duplicate voters in electoral rolls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are ""misleading and misconceived"".  ",2018-10-08,"Assembly Elections,Election Commission,Justice AK Sikri,Justice Ashok Bhushan,Kamal Nath,Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee,MPCC,NewsTracker,Supreme Court,Vikas Singh",SC reserves order on Kamal Nath's plea alleging duplicate voters in electoral rolls in Madhya Pradesh,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sc-reserves-order-on-kamal-naths-plea-alleging-duplicate-voters-in-electoral-rolls-in-madhya-pradesh-5340901.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": The Congress on Monday blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani for the attacks and violence on migrant workers in Gujarat and said they should quit if they are unable to carry out their responsibilities. The Opposition also trained its guns on Modi, saying how he would go to Varanasi and face the people of the state who made him the prime minister, after attacks on migrant labour from Uttar Pradesh in Gujarat, a state of which he was the chief minister for long. Congress President Rahul Gandhi held the targeting of migrant workers in Gujarat as ""completely wrong"". Taking to Twitter, he claimed the root cause of violence in Gujarat was the closure of factories and unemployment in the state. ""There is nothing more frightening than poverty. The root cause of the violence in Gujarat is the closed down factories and unemployment there. Both the system and that economy are reeling. Making migrant labour their target is completely wrong. I stand totally against it,"" Rahul tweeted. Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi alleged the ""politics of exclusion"" continues in Gujarat, while the concerned BJP chief ministers have done nothing to protect the interests of their constituents. ""I directly hold Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for this kind of violence and incidents on migrant labour and the kind of pressure being put on them.  If they do not take responsibility for this and provide the 'Ram Rajya' that they claimed, then they should quit their posts as they have no moral right to continue and hold such important positions and undertake responsibilities,"" she told reporters. Chaturvedi alleged this is the BJP's mindset, wherever it gets to power. ""I want to ask Modi ji as to what he is doing on this. You became the prime minister from Uttar Pradesh and sought votes in Bihar and now you are harrassing them and are trying to send them home,"" she said. ""Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is used by Modi only for political gains, while in Gujarat, people of these states are mistreated. Modi was elected to the Parliament through Varanasi, but what is he doing to protect the livelihood of these people?,"" she said, alleging this phenomenon has been seen in Maharashtra too. She charged Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray was also talking of removing people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan from Maharashtra. 
She also said in Assam certain sections were being targeted in the name of NRC. Meanwhile, additional forces were deployed in industrial areas in Gujarat for the security of Hindi-speaking migrants after attacks on them sparked their exodus that prompted the state government on Monday to make an appeal for their return. Assuring security to the migrants, the Gujarat government said 431 people were arrested and 56 FIRs registered in connection with the attacks, as Vijay Rupani appealed to people not to engage in violence. Claiming that no untoward incident had taken place during the last 48 hours, Rupani said the situation has been brought under control by police.

Press Trust of India," BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has given Rs 2,11,000 crore to farmers since 2014 and it was working with a resolve to double farmers' income. He was addressing a gathering in Jaora, which despite being in Ratlam district, is close to Mandsaur town where six farmers were killed in police firing in June last year. ""In his address after forming the government in 2014, the prime minister had said that the poor and farmers are close to his heart. With this theme in mind, his government has done many works for them. It has also constituted a chief ministers' committee for the purpose and the Madhya Pradesh chief minister is its chairman,"" Shah said while addressing a farmers meet.

Aakar Patel,"As the tenure of this government winds down, I have been reflecting on the things that it has done and what they mean for us ultimately as a nation. We are looking at this, of course, after a week in which the markets have shown not much confidence in the government and its economic policies. The rupee is at its lowest in history and still vulnerable. The price of petrol is at its highest in our history and we have no assurance that it will not be even higher before May. The gains of the stock market over the last several months have been erased in three days. As a Gujarati who has been investing in this country and its growth for the last 20 years, I can personally see and feel the damage, as do other investors. The economy has not grown faster in the last five years than it did during the ten years before this government took power. It has grown slower. We say we are the fastest growing major economy today in the world, but that is because China has slowed more than we have slowed: the undisputed fact is that we have slowed. On the positive side, the government can claim with some legitimacy that it had inflation under control for the most part of its tenure. It can also claim strong action against black money, whether or not we can agree that this action produced any results. 
This is the background on the side of economics. Overall, it is highly unlikely that the government will or can tout its economic record when it begins to prepare its campaign for 2019. On the side of unemployment and growth, there are rival claims. There is no good data tracking this in India, but those who have independent means of tracking it say that the jobs situation and particularly the situation of white collar permanent jobs, is not good and certainly no better than before. The government, through the prime minister, has made some claims that run counter to this. If we were to look at the various reservation agitations by the large dominant peasant groups, the Patidars, the Jats and the Marathas, we would conclude that not enough jobs are being created to shift people from agriculture to the modern economy. On the side of foreign policy, we have been taken to the cleaners by China in our zone of influence. China has encroached in our strategic space in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan and of course Pakistan, through its economic and military power. We are less influential today in our neighbourhood, the Indian Ocean zone and South Asia, than we were five years ago. Not one expert in the field will dispute the facts here. All of this I think is the doing of bigger forces than this government. I do not think any government could have resisted China’s muscle flexing, because China actually possesses those muscles and we don't. Similarly I don’t think any government could have made some big difference to the jobs situation or to the price of petrol or the rate of the rupee. There is a limit to what a government, any government, can do. However, to my mind there is one thing that this government has specifically done which no other government has done before. This is to introduce a tone into our politics and debate where there is only one right side. Only one particular view is in the national interest and to oppose it or to be uncomfortable with it is to be a traitor and an anti-national. This is not a change of substance, but a change in tone. The way we debate and argue in India has dramatically altered since 2014. This government has defined the space which it sees as being the national interest, whether on black money or terrorism or refugees or minority rights. It is not possible today to easily put forward your view if it does not fall inside this space. If you are uncomfortable with military power, and the spending of vast amounts of money on machinery that will never be used (we last used fighter planes in combat more than 40 years ago), then you are not a nationalist. If you think that the anthem and flag have their place but that place is not everywhere, then you hate your country. If you want peace with our neighbours, you are a traitor. I do not have to demonstrate or prove that this change has happened. It is immediately obvious and visible to those of us who have seen it happen before our eyes. We have poisoned our own well and now think of many of our own people as enemies. This is the one change that is going to remain with us, no matter who takes power in 2019 or after. We have unleashed a nastiness and viciousness in ourselves that had been bottled up before. This government has helped uncork it, possible forever, and to my mind that is its most significant achievement.",2018-10-07,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Anti-National,China,InMyOpinion,Pakistan,Patidar Protests,Reservation,Rupee,Unemployment","NDA regime's most unique legacy is constant hunt for 'anti-nationalism', unleashing bottled-up viciousness",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/nda-regimes-most-unique-legacy-is-constant-hunt-for-anti-nationalism-unleashing-bottled-up-viciousness-5334911.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"The Congress said on Sunday the collapse of its seat-sharing talks with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for the upcoming state polls will not affect attempts to forge a ""mahagathbandhan"" (grand alliance) of Opposition parties against the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, however, asserted that the party's leadership had gone with its state units' assessment of the prevailing ground situation, and how many seats it could part with for likely allies. It is believed that the alliance talks between the two parties fell through as the Congress was unwilling to cede as many seats in states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as sought by the BSP. Polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Telangana will be held between 12 November and 7 December in what may be a virtual semi-final to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Counting of votes will be taken up together in all the five states on 11 December. ""State units are better aware of the ground situation than the central leadership. They took a decision and the central leadership accepted it,"" Khera told reporters. He, however, added that this fallout should not be linked to talks for forging a grand alliance for the Lok Sabha polls. ""It should not be confused with attempts to forge a 'mahagathbandhan' that is meant for the Lok Sabha polls,"" Khera said.

Press Trust of India," Justifying his party's alliance with Congress, TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday claimed that it was a 'democratic compulsion' due to 'historic reasons' and was done after TRS spurned his offer for a tie up. Naidu also indicated that Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief K Chandrasekhar Rao poured cold water on his plans to emerge as a potent force in south India by aligning the TDP and TRS. ""I proposed (to KCR) that we two should unite. Congress will be restricted to Karnataka. BJP and Congress have no place in Tamil Nadu. “The two Telugu states will have the upper hand in south India if TDP and the TRS joined hands. He told me he will think it over and a week later turned down my offer,"" Naidu said. He was addressing a meeting of the Telugu Desam Parliamentary (TDP) Party on Saturday. A release from the TDP later gave a gist of what Naidu spoke to his party MPs. The Andhra Pradesh chief minister said political alliances were dictated by democratic compulsions. ""We had no other option except to align with non-BJP forces as the BJP was working against us. We have to fight the injustice the Centre meted out to the state and we need support at the national level for this. Hence, we decided to go with like-minded parties,"" he was quoted as saying. Rao wanted that the TDP contest the elections in Telangana and opposed any alliance with the Congress, he said. ""By then I realized he (KCR) fell into someone else’s hands,"" Naidu said, apparently an indirect reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was only due to historic reasons that TDP allied with parties that came forward in Telangana, he claimed, referring to the 'Maha Kutami' (grand alliance) of TDP-Congress-CPI and Telangana Jana Samiti. He also said that the BJP unilaterally broke its alliance with the TDP in Telangana. ""The seed for weakening the TDP was sown then. BJP had a secret pact with (YSR Congress president) YS Jaganmohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh and KCR in Telangana,"" he alleged. ""The TDP's only objective is the well-being of Telugus, wherever they are. NTR established the TDP only for the Telugus,"" Naidu said. The TDP chief also spoke about the need to forge an alternative front at the national level. ""We have only five-six months for this. We have to hold conclaves across the country on issues like Centre-state relations, farmers' problems and Rafale deal,"" he told the TDP MPs. He recalled that 105 MPs had resigned from their posts en masse on the Bofors scandal.",2018-10-08,"Andhra Pradesh,BJP,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,India,K Chandrashekhar Rao,NewsTracker,Telagana,Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS),Telugu Desam Party (TDP),YS Jaganmohan Reddy",Chandrababu Naidu calls alliance with Congress 'democratic compulsion' after TRS turns down offer to unite in Andhra Pradesh,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/chandrababu-naidu-calls-alliance-with-congress-democratic-compulsion-after-trs-turns-down-offer-to-unite-in-andhra-pradesh-5336971.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will spend his MP area development funds on Rae Bareli, a move being seen as an attempt by the BJP to breach the Gandhi family bastion in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. 'Representative' of Arun Jaitley and Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai told  , ""Almost a month back, Jaitley had chosen Rae Bareli district as a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh. The backwardness of the district, despite being represented by a prominent political family, and the various demands which have been emanating from the district, prompted Jaitley   to choose it."" Under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), each MP has the choice to suggest to the district collector for works to the tune of Rs 5 crore per annum to be taken up in his/her constituency. A Rajya Sabha MP can recommend works in one or more districts in the state from where he/she has been elected. Bajpai said, ""The Union finance minister may tour Rae Bareli in the first or second week of November."" However, Bajpai ruled out any possibility of a battle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections between Sonia Gandhi and Arun Jaitley. ""He (Jaitley) will not contest the Lok Sabha elections, but will strengthen the BJP in the Congress bastion,"" Jaitley's representative said. The people in Rae Bareli have been demanding a stadium, a university, solar lights and solar energy-operated pumps in remote villages of the district, Bajpai said, and added that efforts would be made to fulfil all the incomplete works in the district so that people could heave a sigh of relief. He also said Rs 2.5 crore had already reached the chief development officer of Rae Bareli (the nodal person to carry out the works using the MPLADS funds). Rae Bareli is currently represented by Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha, while the neighbouring parliamentary constituency of Amethi is represented by Rahul Gandhi (current Congress president). Prior to this, Indira Gandhi had won from Rae Bareli in 1980, while her elder son Rajiv Gandhi had represented Amethi in Lok Sabha in 1984, 1989 and 1991. Sanjay Gandhi had won from Amethi in 1980. ""Rae Bareli, which remained in darkness, as development eluded it during the the Congress rule, has now started experiencing the first rays of development touching its soil. Whenever any stalwart leader enters a district, it adds a new dimension to the growth saga of the district,"" Bajpai said, claiming that people of Rae Bareli are happy that the Union finance minister will be spending his MP area development funds on the district. Jaitley's representative also said, ""This will help the BJP achieve its mission of bagging more than 73 Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 general elections."" Uttar Pradesh sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the BJP won 71 seats, its ally Apna Dal got two, while the SP bagged five and the Congress won the remaining two. Union textiles minister Smriti Irani, during a recent visit to Amethi and Rae Bareli last month, had attacked the Gandhi family for the lack of development in its stronghold. She had accused the two Congress leaders of failing to develop their own constituencies, claiming that 70 to 80 percent of houses were still made of mud. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Sonia Gandhi had bagged 5,26,434 votes and defeated her BJP rival by a margin of 3,52,713 votes.",2018-10-07,"Arun Jaitley,BJP,Congress,Hero Bajpai,NewsTracker,Rae Bareli,Rahul Gandhi,Sonia Gandhi,Uttar Pradesh","Arun Jaitley to spend MP area development funds on Rae Bareli, says Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-jaitley-to-spend-mp-area-development-funds-on-rae-bareli-says-uttar-pradesh-bjp-spokesperson-5335911.html,firstpost,-1,0

Yatish Yadav," One foggy evening in January this year, SP Vaid, then DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Police played an audio clip on his mobile phone for Home Minister Rajnath Singh. It was an intercepted call from Pakistan in which the handler was directing to carry out targeted killings during the local body polls that the Centre was planning to hold towards the end of that month. Vaid told the home minister that Pakistan would try every trick in its terror book to thwart these elections in the state. As expected the polls were deferred by the PDP-BJP ruling coalition citing gloomy security situation. But, that triggered a debate within the central government on overall administrative issues related to the state while strongly backing an early urban local body and panchayat polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also informed that Pakistan was planning to disrupt the democratic process, as panchayat polls, last held in 2011, would accomplish extraordinary dividends for grass root electoral politics in the state. Months later, the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the Mehbooba Mufti government claiming her party did not live up to its promises though refrained from giving out the main reasons responsible for the break-up. Subsequent events surrounding the legal challenge to Article 35A and the boycott of the panchayat and urban local body polls by National Conference and PDP appeared as another set of roadblock. Though the undeterred Centre is moving ahead with polls with Governor Satya Pal Malik in the driving seat, the polls under shadow of fear and killings of political workers would be the real test for NDA’s political nerves. A senior officer is of the opinion that the successful conduct of the panchayat elections in the state will not only revive popular interest in democracy, but will also act as a bulwark against Pakistan’s machinations. He said that since the 14th Finance Commission had doubled the grants to the local bodies to help in achieving equal opportunity and overall development, the move would fill the empty phrase of development. There is no doubt that local body representatives are needed in good governance because they can give the best to the people, however, in the context of Jammu and Kashmir, the situation is little complex. The real development has eluded the state. In fact, Modi had recently enquired from officers as to why benefits of the comprehensive package announced by him in 2015 were not visible on the ground. Although, an officer indicated that civil administration needed to be proactive, some were of the view that governance deficit and general administration lethargy during the PDP-BJP rule in the state were primarily responsible for it, and it was imperative to deliver results on the development front so that the people of the state may start reaping the benefits. In 2015, Modi had announced a Rs 80,000 crore development package for the state including highway projects, power, health, human resources, urban development, agriculture and developing infrastructure in towns. Sadly, that too doesn’t have any action plan report related to gram panchayats. Now, security agencies are of the view that the overall situation in the state is generally in control with considerable success in neutralising top militant commanders to cultivate the gains. This also provides opportunity for the administration to fill the governance vacuum. Miracle doesn’t happen in emptiness. The NDA government is quietly working on several fronts. Besides increasing remuneration of special police officers last month, the government is also strengthening the counter-infiltration grid in the state. Since a sustained operation against separatist elements to disrupt funding from Pakistan is showing the result, the government is working on another proposal to check foreign channels telecasting anti-national content in the Valley. A proposal is also being mulled to shift the Central Jail from downtown Srinagar to a location outside the city limits after an internal report suggested that it had become a hub of planning for all terrorist activities. Beyond party politics, for a vibrant democracy, there is no easier path than integrating people with the mainstream, and the local body elections are being seen as the transformation that will not only defeat Pakistan’s nefarious design, but also offer a new hope to the people, with maturity and responsibility.",2018-10-08,"Article 35a,BJP,CriticalPoint,Development,Development Programmes In Kashmir,Gram Panchayat,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Local Body Polls,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayat Polls,Jammu And Kashmir ULB Polls,Kashmir,Kashmir Issue,Militancy,Narendra Modi,NC,NDA,Pakistan,PDP,Rajnath Singh,Satya Pal Malik,Separatists,SP Vaid,Terrorism",Successful local body polls in Jammu and Kashmir will act as a bulwark against Pakistan machinations,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/successful-local-body-polls-in-jammu-and-kashmir-will-act-as-a-bulwark-against-pak-machinations-5333811.html,firstpost,-1,0
K Nageshwar,"TRS chief K Chandrashekar Rao, in his election campaign meetings, has been repeatedly   and invoking Telangana pride. Rao's tirade against Naidu has transformed into a sort of social media war between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which is reminiscent of the bitter divide which was seen during the movement for a separate state. Addressing a series of meetings in the poll-bound state in Nizamabad, Nalgonda and Wanaparthy, the TRS chief called Naidu a “thief” and “traitor.” Tearing into the Congress-TDP alliance, a fuming Rao said, ""People should not support the traitor of Telangana. He is an evil person, a thief who got caught (a reference to the notes-for-votes scam allegedly involving Naidu offering inducement to an MLA to vote in his party’s favour in the elections to the Legislative Council). Do we want such a person to rule us? Aren't the years of enslavement that we suffered enough? We no longer need to be slaves to Delhi and Amaravati."" Rao is obviously angry over the attempts of the Opposition parties — Congress , TDP, CPI and the Telangana Jana Samithi — to form a   to take on his party. The election in Telangana, necessitated by the premature dissolution of the Assembly, is due to be held on 7 December. In fact, Chandrababu Naidu had led the Telangana unit of the TDP from the front during the 2014 elections and afterwards. But after the alleged notes-for-votes scam surfaced, he slowly retreated from active politics in the state. This cost the TDP dear in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Hyderabad has a significant proportion of people who hail from the Seemandhra region that constitutes the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh. This section of the population is generally considered to be disinclined towards parties espousing sub-regional Telangana pride. The TDP, with its electoral partner BJP, won 20 Assembly seats (15 on its own) in 2014, most of which were from the city. However, the party was decimated in the GHMC elections, which were swept by the TRS. Political observers, and even TDP activists, attributed this to the absence of Chandrababu Naidu from the campaign. Naidu has acquired the image of having placed Hyderabad on the global IT map. Now, with the TDP joining the Congress-led Opposition combine, Rao fears a repeat of the 2014 election. Since 2014, the TDP saw many desertions, with the TRS poaching almost all of its legislators. Despite this, the TDP enjoys some support in the state, especially in Hyderabad and a few other pockets like Khammam and Nizamabad, where there is a sizable numbers of voters who originally hail from Seemandhra. The TDP and Congress claim that Rao is acting at the behest of Narendra Modi due to the latter's animosity towards Chandrababu Naidu. The TDP chief has, in fact, alleged that Rao has colluded with Modi to target him. He, however, said that he would not respond to personal attacks by Rao. The post-bifurcation period had initially seen bonhomie between the chief ministers of the two Telugu states. Rao had joined the celebrations in Amaravati when the prime minister inaugurated the new capital of Andhra Pradesh. Further, when asked about roping in Naidu into his proposed federal front, Rao had described him as his best friend. The TRS has extended support to Andhra Pradesh’s demand for special status. All this was seen as a strategy to woo the Seemandhra electorate, which forms a decisive vote base in several constituencies in Telangana. However, as the TDP moved towards the Congress to challenge Rao, the bonhomie turned into hostility. Rao’s strong attack on the TDP is not just an angry outburst over Naidu's attempts to form a broad Opposition combine with the Congress. It is a calculated strategy to turn the election into a Rao-Naidu fight, so as to rally the people of Telangana against the alleged machinations of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister. The TRS believes that this would dissuade the Telangana voter from preferring the Congress-led mahagatbandhan, of which the TDP is a part. The movement for a separate state of Telangana was primarily against the domination of the Andhra-based political leadership. The two Telugu states still have many unresolved issues, like sharing of the waters of the Krishna and Godavari rivers; dividing joint properties, etc. Naidu, being the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, has obviously defended the interests of his state. The Andhra Pradesh government objected to the prestigious Kaleshwaram and Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation schemes in Telangana. The high court is still undivided. There is a widespread perception that Naidu is responsible for the undue delay in the bifurcation of the judiciary. The wounds of bifurcation are still fresh. The TRS and Rao want to appeal to precisely this Telangana identity in order to question the TDP. Thus, Rao wants to frustrate the attempts of the Congress to mount a joint Opposition fight against the TRS in the upcoming Assembly elections. It is difficult to predict to predict the gainers and losers from this renewed battle. However, the battle will have major implications for Telugu society.",2018-11-01,"Amaravati,Assembly Election 2018,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,Hyderabad,K Chandrashekar Rao,KCR,PoliticsDecoder,TDP,Telangana,Telangana Assembly Election 2018,TRS",K Chandrashekar Rao's tirade against Chandrababu Naidu is aimed at invoking Telangana pride ahead of polls,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/k-chandrashekar-raos-tirade-against-chandrababu-naidu-is-aimed-at-invoking-telangana-pride-ahead-of-polls-5335211.html,firstpost,-1,0
Jyoti Punwani,"Will the Opposition in Maharashtra form a united alliance against the BJP in 2019? On Saturday, the Congress again expressed unwillingness to join any formation that has the AIMIM in it. 
Until AIMIM Aurangabad MLA   last month, of a tie-up between Asaduddin Owaisi and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, it was almost a given that the Congress-NCP combine would ally with the Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, a front comprising all anti-BJP parties in the state as well as the two parties of the Left. Jaleel’s announcement, met with skepticism by Ambedkar’s allies, took concrete shape on 2 October, when Owaisi and Ambedkar jointly addressed a mega rally in Aurangabad. Till now, the Congress had cited the AIMIM’s ""communal politics’’ as unacceptable. But on Saturday, an MPCC member pointed to Owaisi’s speech at the rally as the reason they couldn’t team up with this new alliance. In his half-hour speech, the Hyderabad MP spent far more time lashing out at the Congress than at the ruling party in the state and the Centre. Significantly, he referred to the Congress as the ""Nehru-Gandhi parivar’’, a phrase popularised by the BJP. This was not Owaisi’s usual audience of Muslims. More than half the ground was packed with Ambedkar’s supporters. Billed as the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Shetkari Adhiveshan (farmers’ meet), the crowd comprised OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, with a large number of women. Accordingly, the fiery orator changed tack. Though he started as usual with the invocation recited at the start of every Muslim meet: ""Bismillah al Rahman al Rahim’’, it was followed by ""Namaskaar’’ and only then ""Assalamualaikum."" Gone were the frequent references to Allah; the parallels drawn between heroic episodes of Islamic history and the atrocities heaped on Muslims in India today; the evocative cries of "" ’’ and "" ’, all of which have always enabled Owaisi to drive his overwhelmingly Muslim male audience to a frenzy. So how did the AIMIM chief address this new audience? Having always appealed primarily to Muslim identity, he used the same marker here. He simply used the name given by Ambedkar to his new front. ""  (you in a position of responsibility among the bahujan vanchit community),’’ Owaisi exhorted his audience. "" …’’ (Today, the people of the bahujan vanchit samaj have united),” he said. As if this was not enough, Owaisi thought it necessary to list all the castes gathered there, right at the start, and again during his speech, reading out their names from a slip of paper. Obviously, the names from Maharashtra were unfamiliar to the MP whose primary base has always been the old city of Hyderabad. Muslim victimhood has always been the mainstay of Owaisi’s speeches. A litany of the major communal riots, with graphic descriptions of the brutalities Muslims were subjected to in them, are constants in his speeches. In Aurangabad, he omitted these but chose to recount instead the indignity that the Mahar caste was subjected to by the Peshwas in Maharashtra: the earthen pot that they had to carry round their necks to spit into, and the broom they had to tie round their waists. One wonders what the Mahars, proud Ambedkarites, felt about this narration in the 21st century, of a practice abandoned more than a century ago. Normally, Owaisi projects himself as the messiah of Muslims. But his half-hour speech in Aurangabad was a paean to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Owaisi said that Ambedkar, ""by giving us the Constitution, gave us — the bahujan vanchit samaj — the status of human beings."" But while praising Ambedkar, Owaisi made sure to run down the Congress, which he, using Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala’s words, mockingly referred to as the ""  (sacred thread wearing) party’’, one which has ""Brahmin blood in its DNA’’. ""Let me teach you the history these others won’t,’’ he told his audience, specifically asking young Muslims to pay attention. Citing instance after instance when the ""Nehru-Gandhi parivar’’ had slighted Ambedkar, he informed the audience that it was with the help of the Muslims of Bengal — the Muslim League there — that Ambedkar had got a place in the Constituent Assembly. Later, in the 1952 general election, Nehru had campaigned the most against Ambedkar. Then came the punchline: ""We (Muslims) lifted Babasaheb Ambedkar on our shoulders and put him in the Constituent Assembly; now we will put his grandson in the Lok Sabha.’’ This was a selective rendering of history. Jogendra Nath Mondal, who ensured that Ambedkar entered the Constituent Assembly, migrated to Pakistan, became a minister and later returned disillusioned. As for the 1952 election, Prakash Ambedkar had himself said in a TV interview that the person most opposed to Dr Ambedkar’s candidature was the CPI’s SA Dange. But half-truths suited Owaisi’s twin goals well. Not only could he appeal to Muslim pride in having helped Ambedkar, he could also destroy the Congress’ reputation. ""On the one side, you have Narendra Modi and on the other, the party that has Brahmin blood in its DNA. Where will you, vanchit bahujan samaj go?” he asked. Calculated to wreck any chance of a Congress-Prakash Ambedkar alliance, the AIMIM chief’s speech has probably also put paid to the possibility of a broad united front in the state against the BJP in 2019.",2018-10-07,"AIMIM,Asaduddin Owaisi,BJP,Congress,Maharashtra,Nehru-Gandhi Family,PoliticsDecoder,Prakash Ambedkar,Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi",Asaduddin Owaisi demolishes chances of broad anti-BJP alliance in Maharashtra with diatribe against Congress,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/asaduddin-owaisi-demolishes-chances-of-broad-anti-bjp-alliance-in-maharashtra-with-diatribe-against-congress-5336131.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,": DMK chief MK Stalin Sunday flayed the Election Commission (EC) for not announcing by-elections to two Tamil Nadu assembly constituencies citing monsoon as the reason and said it was not a 'justifiable' decision. Expressing 'surprise' at the EC's decision, he said by-elections had been held in the state in the past during the North East Monsoon season, between October-December. ""The by-poll for RK Nagar constituency, held to fill the vacancy caused by the death of late chief minister Jayalalithaa, was conducted only during the monsoon season in December 2017,"" he pointed out. The EC while announcing poll schedule for five states and by-elections in Karnataka Saturday had said Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan had written a letter asking the commission not to announce the poll dates as there was forecast of cyclones and rains in the state. ""The EC putting off by-polls citing a letter by the state chief secretary and the monsoon does not appear to be a unbiased and justifiable decision,"" Stalin said in a 
statement. By-polls are due in Thiruvarur and Thirupparankundram Assembly constituencies which fell vacant following the demise of DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi on 7 August and AIADMK MLA AK Bose on 2 August respectively. Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat had said the EC would announce the by-poll after ascertaining the situation. Stalin said by-polls for three assembly constituencies in the state when Jayalalithaa was hospitalised in 2016 were also held during monsoon season in November. Claiming that the ruling AIADMK was afraid of facing elections, he accused it of avoiding the by-polls through the Chief Secretary. Senior AIADMK leader and Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai sought to dismiss the Opposition party's charge and said the EC was an independent and powerful body which none can influence.

FP Staff,"The first phase of urban local body (ULB) polls begin in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, but many here are ""clueless"" about the exercise with most of them complaining about not knowing their candidates or even when to vote. As many as 584 polling stations will be set up in Jammu where the first phase of the four-phased local body elections will take place on 8 October, officials said on Saturday. A total of 4,42,159 electorate will vote to elect their representatives among 743 candidates at 584 polling stations including 505 polling stations for municipal corporation Jammu and 79 for municipal committees, district election officer, Ramesh Kumar told reporters in Jammu. Shoaib Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar from an uptown locality, said people in his ward do not know who the candidates are this time. The summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is going to vote in the first phase. ""Ask anyone here if they know who the candidates are. Everyone will tell you, they have no idea. There is too much secrecy,” Ahmad, who works in a private company, said. He alleged the government was only interested in ""showing"" that an election was held, but not with the conduct of the polls in a proper manner. While 447 candidates are in the fray for the 75 wards of municipal corporation Jammu, 296 candidates are trying their luck in the 79 wards of seven municipal committees. A total of 422 wards spread over various districts of Jammu and Kashmir are going to polls in the first phase. A police official said the prevailing situation in Kashmir does not allow candidates to campaign openly as there is a threat to their lives. While separatists have called for a boycott of the polls, militants have threatened to target persons taking part in these elections. ""The candidates have been given security and most of them have been taken to secure locations, but the situation is such they cannot campaign. The threat is not only from militants, but from mobs as well,"" the official said. The complains of not knowing the candidates were not limited to the city. People in many other areas of the valley expressed ignorance regarding the details of the polls in their wards. Ishfaq Ahmad, a resident of Ganderbal, which is voting in the last phase on 16 October, said such is the level of secrecy that people are joking that only the candidates themselves know they are standing in the elections. ""We have no idea who is contesting from our ward. There has been no campaign or door-to-door canvassing by anyone so far. Even the government has not put the details of the candidates on the election commission website. There are simply no details anywhere. Only the candidate would know that he is contesting. Perhaps, even their family does not, such is the secrecy,” he said. He said ""most of the people would boycott the polls"", but relatives and friends of the candidates would exercise their franchise. Another potential voter here, Khalid said he was earlier excited about voting but now he believes the polls should be put on hold till there is an improvement in the situation. ""The government says the situation does not permit them to provide details of candidates. In that case, they should have delayed the polls till there was some improvement. I was excited to vote, especially since EVMs were introduced. However, I do not have essential details for voting, so how and why will I vote?"" he asked. Apart from the secrecy regarding candidates, people in some areas of the city here do not know when to vote. ""Forget about who is contesting, we do not even know when is voting taking place in our area,"" Ghulam Qadir, a resident of Sekidafar area in the city said. He said he has seen many elections, but ""nothing like this has ever happened"". ""People are clueless on the date of voting. The government should have advertised in newspapers with poll details on a phase-basis. Most of the people here do not know their ward numbers. Nothing like this has ever happened,"" Qadir said. A senior Congress leader said the atmosphere in the state was not conducive for polls, but the party decided to contest after the Centre ""forced"" the elections on the people. ""This is the most low profile election in the history of the state.  We have not seen anything like this. The atmosphere was not conducive for the polls, but it was thrust on us by the Centre,"" he said.

The Congress chief, speaking at the   Leadership Summit said the RSS was running 1,30,000 schools across the nation.  ""These numbers are so big,"" Rahul said at the summit in Delhi. Twice. Now, any organisation would be pleased to take this statement—having built such a vast network of its educational institutes—as a compliment. More so coming from a known adversary. However, the Congress chief was not offering a compliment, nor did the RSS take it as a pat on the back. Through his statement, Rahul was asking: Who funds these institutions? After speaking to RSS leaders and taking a look at the website of 'Vidya Bharati Akhil Bhartiya Siksha Sansthan’,  ascertained that Rahul was bit off the mark: Vidhya Bharati ran 23,320 schools and number of Ekal (single teacher) Vidhyalaya was 76,611. So that's around one lakh schools (including primary, secondary, intermediate and teachers' training schools). Returning to Rahul's original charge: What is the source of funding? His argument was the BJP-ruled states were diverting funds meant for the public to RSS run schools. He also said that BJP MPs and MLAs were contributing money out of their MPLADS (Members of Parliament Local Area Development Fund Scheme). Rahul said this while responding to a query on “subversion of institutions” by the government. He gave the impression that growth of Saraswati Vidyalayas and Ekal Vidyalayas run by RSS affiliates were a phenomenon associated with government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP governments in various states. The schools, associated with “one particular ideology”, were growing in number due to the patronage of BJP governments and diversion of resources which should otherwise have gone to government schools, Rahul alleged. Atul Kotari of Bharatiya Siksha Utthan Nyas said these institutions don’t seek funds from the government. ""We seek donations a large number of people. Influential persons from society donate for the cause. Ekal or one teacher schools, are run in forest, tribal and hilly areas including in Kashmir and North East 'in areas out of reach of government schools'"" Kotari said. RSS Alkil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Arun Kumar said it should be clear that the RSS does not run schools. ""Mohan Bhagwat recently made clear that the only work the Sangh does is “vyakti nirman” (building an individual) and it is incumbent on these individuals to pursue work which they deem fit,"" Kumar said. ""It’s true that Vidya Bharati and Ekal Sanstha are run by individuals built by the Sangh. They work with the support of the people and work under the established legal order. All donations are collected in a transparent manner through banks and many known personalities are associated with this mission."" Yet another RSS leader, speaking to   on the condition of anonymity, denied Rahul's allegations. He argued that today, the BJP and its associates rule 20 states and things would have been different if it were suggested that the educational work at these institutions be done under official patronage. “We have developed a unique model, where each school is run by a committee which includes one swayamsevak and some prominent persons of that area. Since teachers in these schools work with a nation building mission, they work at a far lower salary than those in government and private schools. We build a 'guru-shishya' tradition in these schools,"" he said. Their argument is that these schools pre-date the emergence of BJP and are spread in areas where BJP does not have any substantive presence: Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, and Jammu and Kashmir. West Bengal, for instance, has 290 Vidya Bharati schools and Odisha has 1,000 schools. The first RSS-affiliate school was opened in 1946 in Kurushetra. The second in Gorakhpur in 1952. Then they began expanding to various parts of the country. Different committees were formed in different states and Vidya Bharati was established in 1977 for the purposes of better coordination and structured exchange of ideas. Fifty lakh students are enrolled in these schools. Naturally, that figure should be of concern for the Congress president. And his charge that the resources for these schools came from BJP MPs and MLAs through their MPLADS? RSS Delhi wing prachar pramukh Rajeev Tuli said he had no idea about this. However, considering some contributions from an MPs fund was made to a school building, these must have been done through established legal processes because of existing guidelines for spending under these schemes, he added.",2018-10-05,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,2019 Lok Sabha Polls,BJP,Congress,Grand Alliance,India,InMyOpinion,Mahagathbandhan,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,Politics,Rahul,Rahul Gandhi,TheySaidIt","Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of using public funds to run RSS schools; pramukhs, swayamsevaks rebut Congress chief's charge",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-accuses-bjp-of-using-public-funds-to-run-rss-schools-pramukhs-swayamsevaks-rebut-congress-chiefs-charge-5326831.html,firstpost,-1,0
TS Sudhir,"All through the Jayalalithaa years, O Panneerselvam was seen as Amma's prostrator-in-chief. The ultimate loyalist who despite being made chief minister twice when Jayalalithaa had to step aside, never sat in the CM's chair. That mask of docility came off in February 2017 when he rebelled against VK Sasikala's leadership of the AIADMK after being asked to step aside as the chief minister. Tamil Nadu was led to believe that here was an anti-corruption crusader with a spine. That mask of sacrifice for the sake of ethical politics got ripped off in August when he decided to do a   and work as deputy to Edappadi Palaniswami, originally appointed by Sasikala. He tried to justify his decision by publicly admitting that had Narendra Modi not advised him, he would not have agreed to play second fiddle in a government where he was chief minister thrice before was it. Now if TTV Dhinakaran, the leader of the rebel group of the AIADMK who has since floated his own party, is to be believed, there was yet another mask that OPS was wearing all this while. On 12 July 2017, OPS had a clandestine meeting with Dhinakaran arranged by a businessman during which he reportedly apologised to him for his revolt and evinced interest in joining hands once again. But despite making this offer, OPS merged his outfit with the ruling AIADMK led by EPS a month later. In the last week of September 2018, OPS reportedly reached out to Dhinakaran through the same businessman and also his son and brother. The message this time was that he wanted to get rid of EPS and help appoint Dhinakaran to an important position. Dhinakaran claims he refused to meet OPS and instead chose to expose Panneerselvam's double face. OPS did not deny the meeting but in his version, it was Dhinakaran who took the initiative for the meeting. ""I met Dhinakaran due to political courtesy and it is not a crime. The meeting was arranged by the other side which kept calling me,"" explained OPS. Asked if he tried for a meeting last week, OPS dismissed it as a bluff by Dhinakaran and denied any plot to overthrow EPS. ""Why should I try to destabilise this government. I am deputy chief minister and part of this government. I will never become the chief minister through the back door,"" he said. What this revelation has done is to hit at Panneerselvam's credibility. Picture this. A sizeable number of AIADMK cadre had thrown its weight behind OPS supporting his '  (holy war)' against Sasikala, Dhinakaran, and company. But unknown to any of them, he was meeting the same Dhinakaran he was claiming to fight. Also Dhinakaran's party colleagues knew all along that such a secret meeting had taken place but till this was outed on Friday, not a single person in the ruling AIADMK knew about it. This disclosure has irked his close aides and has created a trust deficit vis-a-vis him. In fact, realising the damage it was doing to the AIADMK's image of a united front, early on Friday, state electricity minister P Thangamani waded into the controversy by accusing Dhinakaran of sending a mediator requesting for a merger and that the ruling AIADMK leadership spurned the offer. Another senior AIADMK leader close to Panneerselvam, KP Munusamy rubbished Dhinakaran's claims, denying any meeting between OPS and Dhinakaran. Now that OPS has accepted that he did meet Dhinakaran, Thangamani and Munusamy have been left with egg on their faces. Given the BJP leadership's antipathy to the Mannargudi family, Modi is not likely to be pleased about the fact that the man he backed in Tamil Nadu was doing his own thing on the side, without keeping anyone in the loop. Why did Dhinakaran decide to expose Panneerselvam considering he had kept the meeting a secret for over a year? He claims that after he turned down the request for a meeting, OPS on 30 September mocked him at a meeting in Mannargudi asking ""how will a small pin dismantle a mountain"". That's when Dhinakaran says he decided to show the true colours of OPS to the world. But the real intention seems to be with an eye to set the cat among the AIADMK pigeons ahead of the Madras High court verdict in the case related to the Speaker's disqualification of 18 MLAs belonging to the Dhinakaran camp which is expected next week. If the court quashes the Speaker's decision, it will push the Tamil Nadu government into a minority and it is here that the revelation that Panneerselvam was meeting Dhinakaran secretly, would expose the fault lines. There is also the caste angle to this entire drama. Panneerselvam in terms of stature and seniority is the tallest Thevar leader in the ruling party today. The other biggies in the state cabinet are all from the Gounder community — EPS, Thangamani, municipal administration minister SP Velumani and education minister KA Sengottaiyan. The Delhi face of the AIADMK M Thambidurai is also a Gounder. A weak Panneerselvam will mean Dhinakaran emerges as the tallest Thevar politician in Tamil Nadu and he could leverage that to woo the MLAs from the community on to his side should the court verdict go against the government. With a dented image, Panneerselvam will no longer have the moral stature to command loyalty of the MLAs from his community and region. EPS will have reason to be pleased with Friday's developments. His competitor within the party and the government has diminished in stature. And while Dhinakaran may succeed in bringing down the government if the court quashes the Speaker's decision, he will find it tough to take control of the AIADMK. This is because 28 of the 135 AIADMK MLAs who were elected belong to the Gounder community and will rally behind the biggies, who apart from wielding political clout are also moneybags. EPS has stayed in office for 18 months despite all odds and even his critics credit his survival skills.",2018-10-06,"AIADMK,Dharma Yudham,E Palaniswami,EPS,J.

Press Trust of India," The Telangana Rashtra Samithi would not ally with the BJP or support it in the next Lok Sabha election as the regional party was secular and the two parties had ""very strong differences of opinion"", TRS leader and IT Minister KT Rama Rao said. Rao, son of caretaker chief minister and TRS supremo K Chandrashekar Rao, also dubbed as "" "" (weak combine) the proposed grand alliance of Congress, TDP and some other parties for the coming Assembly election in the state. He made the comments during an interaction on Twitter on Thursday. ""We are an extremely secular party which carries people of all hues and shades and all sections of society. We don't believe in polarising based on community and based on any other criteria that divides us. So, the question of joining (hands with) BJP or aligning with them does not arise,"" Rama Rao said. He was replying to a question if the TRS would support BJP in next year's Lok Sabha elections. ""We don't see eye-to-eye on a number of counts. In fact, we have very strong differences of opinion,"" he added. He charged the Congress and the TDP with ""doing a great deal of injustice"" to the people of the state, especially for those who championed the cause of statehood for Telangana. According to him, the Congress and the TDP have given a ""golden"" opportunity to the people of Telangana to shoot two birds with one stone — hit the two parties with one vote. ""My request is to vote them out of Telangana and ensure that TRS is elected again,"" he said. He expressed hope that the TRS would win the coming elections, necessitated by the premature dissolution of the Assembly by the government led by the party. Rama Rao said he was focused on ensuring the return of party chief Rao as the chief minister. He said the TRS was considering including an ""unemployment allowance"" in its election manifesto. He also claimed that no government had done as much as theirs for the youth, especially for the unemployed. ""We have already issued notifications for 90,000 (government) jobs to be filled in the last four years and recruitment of nearly 40,000 persons has been done,"" he said. As for criticism of the government by some Opposition parties, Rama Rao said political parties in a democracy have every right to criticise.

FP Staff,"The Election Commission, which was   the polling schedule in four election-bound states at 12.30 pm on Saturday afternoon, has rescheduled the time of its press conference to 3 pm. However, the move has garnered much attention as Congress Spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala hinted in a tweet that the shift in time schedules was only to accommodate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Ajmer rally. While Surjewala was careful not to lay any direct allegations on the Election Commission which is an independent body under the constitutional statute, he did insinuate that the hurried change in the timing of presser was because it clashed with the prime minister's rally in poll-bound Rajasthan. He tweeted: According to the Election Commission rules, the Model Code of Conduct kicks in right after the dates of polling are announced in a state. The MCC has several sections regulating the canvassing process ahead of the election, including the announcement of populist schemes by the ruling dispensation just in the run-up to the polls. Modi who will address a rally in Ajmer, marking the end of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's Gaurav Yatra is likely to make some last minute announcements to woo the voters. Moreover, Surjewala's allegations are important in view of the fact that earlier too, there was a controversy relating to the announcement of poll dates. In March this year, the Opposition had accused the poll panel of  leaking the dates of Karnataka elections to the ruling party when BJP's Information and Technology cell head Amit Malviya  election and counting before the Election Commission could announce it through a press conference. The claim was fiercely contested by the ruling party, which in turn, pointed out a tweet put out by another   15 minutes before the election schedule was announced. The poll panel reacted by launching an enquiry into the alleged leak. Both the BJP and Congress in turn defended their social media satraps by saying they caught the dates through some media reports. The poll panel will announce the election dates in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Mizoram at 3 pm today.

Suhit K Sen,"Speaking at a media conclave on Friday, Congress president Rahul Gandhi remained confident that his party could work out a nationwide alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. His confidence stems largely from the fact that though BSP chief Mayawati had torpedoed a seat-sharing deal with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan a couple of days ago, she had conceded the honesty which United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Rahul showed in pursuing an alliance. Rahul helpfully pointed out that alliance in states and an alliance at the Centre were two different animals and the indications he had were that the two parties would 'come together' for the national elections. That is an imponderable. There would be little profit in expending time speculating on the possibilities, given the facts that the elections are a distance away and that Mayawati is a mercurial customer at the best of times. But there's something else that the Congress president also said is significant. ""We were,"" he said, ""flexible in states. In fact, I was more flexible than some of our state leaders."" What does this mean? Quite obviously, it is a more nuanced re-statement of what Mayawati had said herself: that while the Gandhi’s were honest about the alliance, it was sabotaged by state Congress satraps. How far this is true, and in what exact way, is not the point, but that both Gandhi and Mayawati share this perception, is. This speaks volumes about the functioning of the Congress. It means that state leaders are free, ultimately, to decide on important aspects of party policy such as pre-election alliances. In a theoretical way, this might not be a bad thing. It is eminently desirable that vital party issues be debated and discussed at every level before a determination is reached. That theoretical position would work, however, if the Congress had had, in all other ways, a democratic institutional structure and culture. It doesn’t. Intra-party elections are a distant memory and legislature parties have no freedom to elect their leaders. The principle of electing a part of the Congress Working Committee was junked after the second split in the Congress in early 1978 led to the creation of the Congress (I) led by Indira Gandhi. From the point of view of the Congress’s larger interests, the failure to cement an alliance is bound to have adverse consequences both with regards to the Assembly elections, later this year, in the two states mentioned and the putative negotiations over a nationwide alliance for the 2019 elections. Gandhi was publicly optimistic when he said the failure to sign a deal would not have an adverse impact on his party’s prospects. But it certainly will in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where an alliance could have lengthened the odds on the existing regimes considerably. In Rajasthan, an alliance would have served as a token of good faith. In other words, Gandhi, or an emissary, should have been more involved in the minutiae of negotiations and asserted the high command’s jurisdictional authority. Another significant statement made by Gandhi pertained to his prime ministerial aspirations. He was undoubtedly diplomatic when he said he was a candidate for the top job if other parties in a proposed alliance were agreeable to his candidature. But in such matters it is hard to be too diplomatic. The Congress president would have been better advised to have let well alone. This is not the time to discuss prime ministerial ambition. Finally, Gandhi did come into his own when he took the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on, headlong. He made several important points, all valid. First, he said that the time had passed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi could keep blaming the Congress for everything that was falling off the precipice: the economy mainly. The BJP will find it difficult to rebut the robustly pointed at the price the country was paying for ‘hatred’: the decimation of the economy signalled by the implosion of the stock market, the unchecked slide of the rupee, farmers’ suicides and much else. It remains for Gandhi to translate this rhetoric into outcomes, which is the crucial, if unfinished, piece of business that will finally count. To do this he will have to streamline his party so that it works as a synchronic chorus, rather than singing from a perplexing array of hymn sheets. He will have to ensure that the party pursues the issues he has been indefatigably hammering away at, at every possible level. Unfortunately, the Congress has not been attacking the BJP on its beleaguered fronts with anything like energy and vigour. If that is the result of a lack of conviction and a loss of morale, it will be up to the boss to inject adequate quantities of both into the party.",2018-10-26,"Assembly Election 2018,Bahujan Samaj Party,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,BSP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,Congress,Congress Working Committee,Kamal Nath,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Mayawati,PoliticalPlay,Politics Of Hatred,Rahul Gandhi,Rahul Gandhi As PM,Rahul Gandhi Leadership,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Sachin Pilot,Samajwadi Party","'BJP at war with its own people': Rahul Gandhi is spot on, but translating rhetoric into outcomes remains the test",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-has-gone-on-war-with-its-own-people-rahul-gandhi-is-spot-on-but-translating-rhetoric-into-outcomes-remains-the-test-5330211.html,firstpost,-1,0
Debobrat Ghose,"The Election Commission on Saturday announced the beginning of the biggest periodical living room drama that this country revels in. By announcing the schedule for elections to the five state Assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Telangana, it has set the agenda that will dictate the national affairs in the weeks to come, and also set pace for the biggest jamboree of all, the Lok Sabha election 2019. According to Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat, barring Chhattisgarh, rest of the four states will have polling in single phase. The first phase of polling in 18 Left-Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected Assembly constituencies in Chhattisgarh will take place on 12 November and second phase for rest 72 seats on 20 November. While the single-phase polling in Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram will take place on 28 November, Rajasthan and Telangana will go to polls on 7 December. Much before the announcement of polling dates, political parties — especially BJP and Congress — had begun sending their star campaigners to these poll-bound states to better their chances in the upcoming contest. Even on Saturday, ahead of the EC announcement of the polling dates at 3 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally at Ajmer in Rajasthan, while his political rival and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is on a day-long tour to Morena and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP, which has been on a winning spree for the last several elections, needs to win in these Assembly polls too. The results of the three big states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan – where the BJP is currently in power – will be crucial as those are likely to set the tone for the bigger contest in 2019 when the Lok Sabha elections will be held. On the other hand, Congress will be desperately seeking to retain Mizoram – one of the three states where it is in power – and simultaneously win in at least two more states going to polls, if not all, as claimed by the party. Given Modi’s constant attention to the North East, the party’s active outreach in the region, and recent expulsion of popular Mizoram Congress vice-president and state Home Affairs Minister R Lalzirliana, retaining Mizoram will be a big challenge for the Congress. Congress has better chances of winning in Rajasthan under the joint leadership of Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot. Of the three big states, this is the only one where the Congress and the BJP have been taking turns at running the state. In the last elections, the BJP had ousted the Congress government to come to power. The game changers, however, will be Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh that have been with the BJP for 15 years each. In Madhya Pradesh, where BJP’s longest serving chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is battling anti-incumbency, the Congress has been trying to show its strength of unity with senior leaders like Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia leading the poll battle. But, Congress’ failure to get into a pre-poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in both Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh is worrying for the party. The factionalism in the state units of Congress can’t be ruled out. Chhattisgarh, where the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress had a neck-and-neck battle in 2013, with a difference of only one percent vote share, former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi’s alliance with the BSP would pose a tough challenge for the Congress. Moreover, Congress in the state doesn’t have a strong face unlike in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The Pradesh Congress has been attacking Chief Minister Raman Singh over corruption and mis-governance. If the Congress pulls a rabbit out of its hat and wins both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, it will not only turn around its own fortunes but also drastically change the course of national politics. It would be nothing short of upsetting BJP’s apple cart. In Telangana, on the other hand, the ruling party – the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) – has already clarified that it would neither ally with the BJP nor be a part of the Congress’ proposed ‘ ’ (grand alliance). The TRS will pose a challenge to both the BJP and Congress. The Congress president on Friday,   ahead of 2019, exuded confidence and said that his party would win in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Congress is visibly confident because by winning the bypolls early this year, it had cleared the litmus test, which could be seen as a sort of semi-final to Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. If Congress wins in these two states, Gandhi's leadership as party president will gain respectability. It will pave way for the Congress getting an upper hand while striking an alliance with other Opposition parties ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Despite failing to stitch an alliance with the BSP in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress president has already expressed confidence of entering a national alliance with the BSP. The ‘Modi factor’ that helped BJP attain phenomenal results in the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the Assembly polls thereafter is now part of Indian political folklore. If the BJP succeeds in retaining its power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan – or at least in two states, and also makes it in Mizoram, Modi’s winning charisma will become bigger than ever before.

Press Trust of India," NCP president Sharad Pawar will not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, party leader Jitendra Awhad said on Saturday. Putting to rest speculations that Pawar will contest from Pune Lok Sabha seat, Awhad told reporters that Pawar had already made it clear in 2014 that he will not contest the Lok Sabha polls again. ""Pawar has told the party not to consider his name as he will not be a candidate. In today's meeting, Pawar said he is not in the (LS) race and nobody should propose his name,"" said the NCP MLA from Mumbra-Kalwa, in neighbouring Thane district. Awhad also denied that the NCP chief had opposed the candidature of Parth Pawar, son of senior leader Ajit Pawar, for the Mawal Lok Sabha seat. ""Preliminary discussions are on. The name will be finalised after discussions with party workers,"" Awhad said. The former Union agriculture minister is currently holding a two-day meeting with NCP leaders and functionaries at the party's state unit office to discuss candidates for the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for next year. The meeting started on Saturday morning. Party sources said Pawar met party workers and leaders from Aurangabad, Raigad, Pune, Baramati, Shirur, Mawal, Nashik, Dindori, Dhule, Jalgaon, Raver, Parbhani, Beed, Kolhapur and Hatkanangle. ""He discussed probable candidates and assured that meritorious party workers would be given a chance. When party leader Ankush Kakade suggested that Pawar himself contest from Pune, he  (Pawar) brushed off the suggestion saying he had already declared in 2014 that he would not contest Lok Sabha polls again,"" NCP sources said. After the meeting, when party leader Chhagan Bhujbal was asked about the demand for Pawar to contest the 2019 LS polls, he said that he wished the NCP chief attained ""a high post"". The NCP plans to stake claim to Jalna, Aurangabad, Dhule and Hatkanangle LS seats, all four of which had Congress candidates in 2014 as per the alliance agreement between the two parties. The Hatkanangle LS seat is currently held by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana's Raju Shetti. He quit the NDA and allied with the Congress recently. In another development, former Maharashtra NCP chief Sunil Tatkare told reporters that he was willing to step aside if Bhaskar Jadhav, another former state party chief, was keen to contest from Raigad Lok Sabha seat. Tatkare had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Raigad against Shiv Sena leader Anant Geete. Geete is the the heavy industries minister in the Narendra Modi government. ""I will work for his (Jadhav) win. If Jadhav is interested, I am willing to withdraw. I am not interested in contesting Lok Sabha polls. More than my candidature, I want to ensure victory of a secular government. If Jadhav is interested, I am supporting him,"" Tatkare said. The NCP has demanded a 50-50 seat-sharing formula for the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats in its alliance talks with the Congress. The two parties had entered into an alliance in 2014 and the Congress contested 27 seats while the NCP put up candidates on 21 LS seats.",2018-10-06,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Congress,Jitendra Awhad,Maharashtra,Nationalist Congress Party,NCP,Sharad Pawar,Sunil Tatkare","NCP leader says Sharad Pawar will not contest Lok Sabha polls, has asked party members not to propose his name",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ncp-leader-says-sharad-pawar-will-not-contest-lok-sabha-polls-has-asked-party-members-not-to-propose-his-name-5332001.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Union Minister Arun Jaitley Saturday said mahagathbandhans in India are tried, tested and failed, saying if such an alliance is formed again then 2019 will be a contest between a stable government led by a strong leader and an ""anarchic combination"". Expressing confidence about the BJP's win in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he said this is not a time for India to test an anarchic kind of combination when it is on the growth path. Giving historical accounts of mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in India, Jaitley said, ""You tried it under Chandra Shekhar, it was partly tried under VP Singh, it was tried under Charan Singh and it was tried under IK Gujaral and Devi Gowda. It's an experiment where policy gets killed and the longevity of the government is a few months."" ""So, these (mahagathbandhans) are tried, tested and failed ideas much that they sound very fancy. In order to have a big alliance, you must have a large nucleus and smaller groups aligned around them. You cannot have a nucleolus of a handful of people and you cannot have an alliance of political parties whose interests are regional,"" the finance minister said at the HT Leadership Summit in New Delhi. Jaitley's comments have come in the run-up to the upcoming assembly polls in some major states and also the Lok Sabha elections. These remarks assume significance amidst talk of formation of a grand alliance of opposition parties to defeat the BJP in 2019. He further said ""you cannot have an alliance with parties whose leaders are maverick or they want to be in an alliance to have criminal cases to be closed. If you get together this kind of a crowd then 2019 will be a choice between a stable government with a strong leader versus a completely anarchic combination"". Observing that history had provided India with a great opportunity, he said, India has been growing fast consistently despite the global slowdown and other factors. ""So, therefore, this is when we need coherence, governance and policy. This is not the time where you can go in for an anarchic kind of combination. I think aspirational societies never commit suicide. So, I am very clear what will happen in 2019,"" he said. Dismissing Congress President Rahul Gandhi's allegation that the Narendra Modi- led government is responsible for mounting bad loans in the banking sector, Jaitley said, ""I think some people need to grow up and understand these issues. Debate on these issues has to be a grown-up debate."" The total amount of debt given till 2007-08 was about Rs 18 lakh crore by public sector banks in the country and when the global slowdown began this Rs 18 lakh crore went up to Rs 55 lakh crore in 2014, he said. Year after year, he said, the previous UPA government was asking banks to grow their lending by 31 percent. ""So the undeserving and unstable projects were all been funded. That's when the bank loot started. So the Congress president must realise that this was the genesis of the problem,"" he said. The second crime that they committed was instead of accepting the problem of additional capacity, banks were asked to roll over the debt when the borrower started defaulting, he said. Citing an example of Vijay Mallya without taking his name, Jaitley said: ""in one of the most controversial cases where a person has escaped to the UK, it was the RBI which wrote to the SBI to please give him (Mallya) the second restructuring"". So you have managed the system to such an extent that the RBI telling State Bank of India that someone should be given a second restructuring, he added. Mallya, who is currently in the United Kingdom, has been charged with defaulting on bank loans to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore.",2018-10-06,"2019 Assembly Polls,2019 Lok Sabha Elections,Arun Jait;Ey,Congress,Mahagathbandhan,Narendra Modi,NewsTracker,Rahul Gandhi,United Opposition","Arun Jaitley says mahagathbandhans in India tried, tested and failed ideas, outcome of 2019 LS polls 'clear'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-jaitley-says-mahagathbandhans-in-india-tried-tested-and-failed-ideas-outcome-of-2019-ls-polls-clear-5330701.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service,"Accusing the Congress of working for only one family and practising vote-bank politics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asked the people to keep it away from power, breaking the state's tradition of alternating power between the Congress and the BJP every five years. Addressing a meeting marking the completion of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's month-long ""journey for pride"", he said ""while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not have the habit of lying as it works on the mantra of 's ' and 'sarva jana sukhay' (interest of all), the opposition is fond of doing vote-bank politics"". ""Those who do vote bank politics, they enjoy the issue of Hindu-Muslim, old-youth, forward-backward, this caste that caste and man and woman,"" he said in his address to party activists in this religious town, where the BJP lost a prestigious Lok Sabha bye-election earlier this year. ""Wherever they get the opportunity they try to divide the society,"" Modi said about Congress adding that it was easy to divide but very hard to unite. ""And the BJP believes in uniting the society,"" he said. ""And this vote bank politics is not limited to elections, but it keeps on going for long."" He said that the result of the vote-bank politics was that the poor who voted for them keep on cursing them for five years. Modi also said that Rajasthan has a tradition of alternating between Congress and BJP every five years and expressed confidence that this time that tradition would be broken. ""This time it should be changed. This time, let us keep Congress away from power in the state and elect the BJP,"" he said. ""The BJP government in the state believes in accountability and thus we believe in presenting the report card of the works our governments has done, whether it's Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh or Chhattisgarh. ""The BJP never hides its face while giving the report card to the people. But the Congress keeps on spreading lies,"" Modi said. ""For 60 years the Congress followed the tradition of vote-bank politics,"" he said. Accusing Congress leaders and workers of worshipping one family, Modi said: ""When I came here, (Chief Minister) Vasundhara Raje told me that the Congress leaders are not present in the Assembly, they do not raise any questions, they do not participate in debates. ""They do not do anything like this because they are busy serving one family, they are busy in worshipping one family. ""For them their high command is one family, but for the BJP our high command is seven and half crore people of the state. Should such forces be allowed again to come to power?"" asked Modi and answered himself, ""We don't have to allow them to come to power again."" Modi said that the Congress which failed in the government in the last 60 years also failed as the opposition. ""Earlier I had said that there should be a clever opposition, dedicated to people, they should have sensibility of people's problem, keep a tab on the government's works, participate in debate and give ideas to the government. ""But it was unfortunate that they have not only failed in the government but they have also failed as an opposition. ""They don't do hard work, thus they have taken the help of lies and false propaganda. And when we dare them for a debate they flee,"" he added. Modi said that after 60 years, the country is in the right direction. ""And they should not be given another chance,"" he said. Attacking Congress President Rahul Gandhi for his hug in Lok Sabha, Modi said, ""There are people who think that they can change the course of their politics with a hug."" Modi also asked the Congress what had stopped them from increasing the minimum support price (MSP) for the farmers. ""Why didn't you increase the MSP for farmers? Who stopped you from doing so? ""We (BJP) did that. We increased the MSP of the farmers and now you (Congress) people have a problem with the Modi government that how I did this. And now as nothing is left for the Congress they are, every morning, manufacturing a new lie,"" he said. Modi also said that about Rs 62,000 crore will go to farmers every year after every farming season. ""Congress never thought for farmers. Farmers have now insurance for crops like never before. So they never dare to debate over development. Why is the Congress not fighting election on facts?"" he asked. Highlighting the works of his government, Modi said that it brought relief for women against triple talaq. ""We do not discriminate on the basis of religion. I thank Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan governments for death sentence against rapists. Now the justice has been fast-tracked. And the demons with such mentality should be scared,"" he said. He also said that now 30 percent women are working in government departments, which is not seen in many of the developed nation yet. ""Our government also gave maternity leave for 26 weeks,"" he said. Hailing the Rajasthan chief minister for implementing the Central Government's task of electrifying all villages in the state, he said, ""When Vasundhara Raje came to power, about 13 lakh people were living in the 18th century (darkness). We had promised electrification for all. We provided electricity to 13 lakh people. Those who are yet to get electricity, the Rajasthan government and the Centre are working for them,"" he said. Modi also said that about two lakh hectare will have irrigation facilities through water from Chambal. The work on the technical survey in 13 districts are on and after that we shall start the work so that 40 percent people of the state will get sweet water to drink,"" he said. The 200-member Rajasthan assembly will go to polls on December 7, where the BJP is in power. The term of the Rajasthan Assembly expires on 20 January, 2019. Slamming the Congress for questioning the second anniversary of the surgical strike as Parakram Parv, Modi said: ""When last week I came to Rajasthan to pay tribute to the brave soldiers, they spread lies that I was going to sound the poll bugle. ""But I was here to celebrate the valour of our armed forces, I was here to celebrate the second anniversary of the surgical strike. "" He said that the surgical strike which was carried out in September 2016 showed the valour of our soldiers. ""But what has happened to Congress?

Press Trust of India," The Congress Wednesday compared RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement on early construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya with the noise made by frogs during rains and accused the RSS-BJP of sending Lord Ram to ""exile"" after every election. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP and the RSS were like ""Kalyug's Kaikeyi"" who remember Lord Ram four months before every election and then send him to exile after it. ""During the season of rains and elections, a number of frogs make noise and that every noise does not become a reality. Lord Ram is everywhere and in the country,"" Surjewala told reporters. ""At one time in Satyug, Kaikeyi had got Lord Ram banished to a 14-year exile. In today's Kalyug, 'Kaikeyi BJP and RSS' have sent Lord Ram to an exile of 30 years. ""After every election, they send Lord Ram to exile and remember him four months before every election. What is the character of BJP and RSS? Ram in their speech and Nathuram in their thought. This is the truth of the BJP.,"" he said. Surjewala said the Congress believes that the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue is pending before the Supreme Court and whatever verdict comes all sides should abide by it and the government should implement it. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said even opposition parties cannot openly oppose a Ram temple in Ayodhya as the deity is revered by the country's majority.

Sanjay Singh,"Minutes ahead of vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha on 17 April, 1999 Mayawati sprung a surprise on then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the entire lot of the ruling BJP. Till that morning and before entering the House, she had assured the support of five BSP MPs to the Vajpayee government, but when her turn came, she gave a brief speech and concluded by saying that her party would vote against the motion. That stunned the treasury benches, because the scales had been tilted. The voting process began immediately after and rest is history — the Vajpayee government lost the vote of confidence by one vote. And in doing so, she proved that she along with her mentor Kanshi Ram was best practitioner of real politik, who could even startle the likes of Vajpayee, LK Advani and Pramod Mahajan. That incident also sent a lasting message about her: Don't ever take Mayawati for granted. Two decades later, the Congress under Rahul Gandhi's leadership seems to have completely forgotten those lessons about her. It took her affectionate hugs with Sonia Gandhi in Bengaluru during the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy as a done deal for a grand alliance with the BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and in Assembly elections where the Congress' will would prevail over her. In a way, the party's top brass appear to have taken her support for granted. Rahul went around the country and abroad talking about the Mahagathbandhan or grand coalition in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (together accounting for 122 Lok Sabha seats) and claiming, on-record and off it that this alliance was going to finish off the BJP in next General Election. He even predicted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's defeat in the Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency. The Congress leaders conveniently forgot that she was a hard-boiled politician, who has risen through the ranks because of sheer personal grit and overpowering ambition. She is the one who keeps the other side on tenterhooks till the last minute. The bargain always has to be in her favour. If she makes a mistake or two, she learns from them and returns the favour in due course. Even in Bengaluru, the pictures of  Mayawati and Sonia featured Rahul in the frame as a mere bystander, standing by his mother's side without exchanging words or conveying positive body language with regional leaders. It was clear that she would accept Sonia as a partner even a leader of larger coalition, but wouldn’t accept Rahul as leader. In one single shot, she punctured the hype around the 'one nation, one Opposition to Modi and BJP' Mahagathbandhan fostered by the Congress and the like-minded. Calling the Congress ""casteist and communalist"", just as the BJP was for her, she concluded her press conference on Wednesday by saying, ""One thing I want to make absolutely clear. Considering the Congress' attitude, my party will not fight elections with the party at any cost. With this important announcement I am ending this media briefing."" Consider her charge against Congress: That ""the truth is Congress in the name of a coalition wants to finish BSP"". Although she made a villain out of Digvijaya Singh, a look at what she said about the Congress makes it clear that she smartly used the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader as an easy pretext to dump the party. Consider her words: ""Congress party  …  …   Congress   Gujarat  …"" The essence of her message was that the Congress was drunk with arrogance and misinformed notions. She went to add how Congress had ill-treated Dr BR Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram. Mayawati sent out a message to her social constituents by making it public that while negotiating for an alliance in Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress leadership was not giving the due honour and dignity she felt her party and its supremo deserved. She made it public that the Congress was offering nine to 10 seats out of a total of 200 seats in Rajasthan, 15 to 20 out of 230 in Madhya Pradesh and five or six out of 90 in Chhattisgarh. By stitching together an alliance with Deve Gowda’s JD(S) in Karnataka, OP Chautala’s INLD in Haryana and Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress in Chhatisgarh, and a proposed alliance with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party and Ajit Singh’s RLD in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati is effective forming a Third Front without saying so in as many words. The JD(S) and INLD have proposed her name as a prime ministerial candidate in 2019. Her own party is pitching her for the top slot. She is open to alliances with smaller parties in other states. She has also been smart in her utterances against the Congress. She blasted the party alright, but has not said anything personally against Sonia or Rahul. That is designed to keep the support line open from the Congress, if need be and keep that one percent chance of a pre-poll alliance for 2019 alive, provided the Congress can bend to her whims. The BSP chief with zero seats in the Lok Sabha has outsmarted Rahul and the Congress both in perception and political astuteness.",2018-10-04,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,BJP,BSP,Kanshi Ram,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Sonia Gandhi","Mayawati walks out of 'mahagathbandhan', outsmarts Rahul and Congress in perception and political astuteness",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mayawati-walks-out-of-mahagathbandhan-outsmarts-rahul-and-congress-in-perception-and-political-astuteness-5316601.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," At least two BJP candidates and one from the Congress have publicly announced their withdrawal from the urban local body polls in Kashmir. Ghulam Hassan Bhat, who claims to be BJP's constituency president for Dooru in Anantnag district, on Thursday said he has decided to withdraw from the contest and also resign from the membership of the party. ""The BJP government has been there for the last 4.5 years but none of the promises made by it have been fulfilled. The people were sold dreams of free (domestic cooking) gas connections and Mudra loans but nothing happened,"" Bhat said. He said his supporters have also resigned from the party and several other BJP candidates for the Dooru Municipal Committee have withdrawn from the polls. Mohammad Maqbool Mir, who had filed his nomination papers as a Congress candidate for the Hajin Municipal Committee in north Kashmir's Bandipora district, came all the way here to announce his withdrawal. ""There is no pressure on me, but I wanted to withdraw from the contest. I went to election office and filled a withdrawal form but the officer there kept delaying me on one pretext or the other. I was then told that my withdrawal form cannot be accepted as the deadline had lapsed,"" Mir told reporters in Srinagar. Mehrajuddin Raina, the BJP candidate for a ward in the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC), announced his withdrawal from local bodies polls through a video message. ""I apologise to my people with folded hands and assure them that I will not repeat this mistake again,"" Raina said. Militants in the Valley have threatened to target anyone who takes part in the urban local bodies and panchayat elections, but none of the withdrawing candidates made any mention of these threats. The threats have had a major impact on the election for the civic bodies in Kashmir as 177 wards had no candidates, while 151 wards each had just one candidate. There are no signs of any campaigning for the polls anywhere in the Valley. Major regional players — the National Conference and the PDP — have boycotted the polls on the grounds that state's special status under Article 35-A of the constitution was under threat due to the legal challenge to this provision in the Supreme Court. The boycott by these parties has come as a major boost for the BJP, which has so far seen 60 of its candidates getting elected unopposed. The state government has said it has made elaborate security arrangements for the contesting candidates to ensure smooth, free and fair polls. Besides the existing security forces, including police, additional 400 companies of central paramilitary forces have been brought in to secure the election process.",2018-10-04,"BJP,Congress,Ghulam Hassan Bhat,India,Jammu And Kashmir,NewsTracker,Politics,Srinagar,Urban Local Body Polls","Jammu and Kashmir urban local body polls: Two BJP candidates, one from Congress announce withdrawal",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-urban-local-body-polls-two-bjp-candidates-one-from-congress-announce-withdrawal-5318001.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sameer Yasir,"Firstpost ***  With political parties desperately looking for candidates in south and north Jammu and Kashmir, where  , Srinagar is presenting a positive picture. According to the chief electoral office, in all the wards of the summer capital, dozens of candidates have submitted their nomination papers. This is in sharp contrast with the situation, particularly in districts in South Kashmir, where the Bharatiya Janata Party's migrant candidates have won many seats because of the lack of opposition. In Shopian district, all migrant Kashmiri Pandit candidates won the wards on BJP tickets, with no local resident filing nomination papers. In North Kashmir's Sopore area, the saffron party's candidates won unopposed as the Congress could not find candidates to contest the polls amid fears of militant attacks. But in Srinagar — a hotbed of militancy in the 1990s — the situation is completely different, with people from even the old city — the hotbed of separatist sentiments — contesting. Although militancy has staged a comeback in Srinagar after a long gap, the candidates participating in the municipal elections are openly roaming in their respective wards and urging people to vote for them. When the   and  , it was feared that the BJP and Congress would find it difficult to field candidates. But contrary to such speculations, both national parties announced candidates from the state capital. Also, a number of families, mostly husband and wife and a few young girls, have also filed their nomination papers as Independent candidates, surprising many. ""Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan is not going to take care of   (the region's need for electricity, roads and water) and other local concerns of the state. It is the duty of the elected representatives of this state,"" said Mohammad Aqib Rinzu Shah, an undergraduate who still is in college. Shah said the state government and its elected representatives from the volatile South Kashmir were forced to flee after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, and later, they forgot to carry out even basic development work. ""The funds were, spent but where did they go? If you ask them (legislators), they have no answer. We pay taxes and development is our right,"" said Shah, a 21-year-old resident of Srinagar's Kral Sangri area. Much against the advise of his friends and family, Shah filed his nomination papers from Brain municipality's ward number 2. His opponent is a former activist and spokesperson of the National Conference, Junaid Mattu, who   against the party's decision to boycott the municipal elections. He is fighting the election as an Independent candidate. Mattu’s resignation was a big surprise. Many consider him the National Conference's proxy candidate, and the party has not issued any statement on such accusations. Instead, it only said that it was ""pleased to accept his resignation"". Mattu, who was a close confidante of National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah, is also seen an ally of  , who heads his faction of the People's Conference. According to reports, Lone will return to the People's Conference, from where he started his political career, once the elections are over. There are also rumours that he may be elected the mayor of Srinagar. Shah describes his contest as ""jihad against the BJP"". However, his detractors see it as a ruse to join politics. He said he has the support of some 40 odd boys and a few girls, who are also in the electoral fray. Shahrish Ahmad, a 29-year-old who submitted her nomination papers for a ward in Srinagar's old town, said: ""There is nothing wrong with fighting for basic issues. Why should people brand us traitors? Same people will then come to us to do their work. Our fighting these elections should not be seen as a vote for India or Pakistan, but for repairing small bunds, footpaths and graveyards."" There are 79 municipal bodies in Jammu and Kashmir, which includes two municipal corporations in the twin capital cities of the state, six municipal councils and 71 municipal committees. For the Srinagar Municipal Corporation, which has the highest number of 6,63,775 voters, nearly every other political party has fielded proxy candidates. For 74 of its wards, 330 people, including women, have filled nomination papers. While the main regional parties are out of the contest, it has brightened the chances for the BJP and the Congress. This is something that has caused some degree of consternation in the Valley. ""By contesting the elections, at least we can stop the BJP from coming to power in the center of the city. They have put Hindu candidates in the electoral fray in the Kashmir Valley rather than choosing a candidate from our community in this Muslim-majority place. We can't allow this to happen,"" Shah said.",2018-10-04,"BJP,BJP Candidates,ConnectTheDots,J&K Panchayat Polls,Jammu And Kashmir,Kashmir Local Elections,Kashmir Polls,National Conference,People's Democratic Party,Srinagar,Srinagar Municipal Corporation,Urban Local Body Polls","Jammu and Kashmir local body polls, Part VI: In Srinagar, local residents file nomination papers to ensure BJP loss",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-local-body-polls-part-vi-in-srinagar-local-residents-file-nomination-papers-to-ensure-bjp-loss-5316801.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The government on Thursday  . Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the Centre had decided to reduce excise duty by Rs 1.50 a litre and had asked oil companies to absorb another Re 1. The price cuts will be effective midnight. While the lowered prices come as a much-needed relief for commuters, this reduction in excise duty — only the second in the four years of the BJP-led NDA government — will make a dent of Rs 10,500 crore in the state exchequer. While announcing the decision, Jaitley asked state governments to match the Central government’s move with a similar reduction in sales tax or VAT. And within minutes, a number of states began to announce their decision to give citizens additional relief of Rs 2.50, bringing the total fuel price cut in these states to Rs 5. However, what could be unsurprising to many is that this decision was announced only by BJP-ruled states. Within minutes of Jaitley’s announcement, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted saying his government had “also decided to give additional relief” of Rs 2.50 on fuel rates in the state. “This will give huge relief to common citizens,” he added. “The central and state government are working together to give more and more relief to the people,” he told  . Soon after, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani echoed Fadnavis, “reciprocating positively to the finance minister’s announcement”.  Besides poll-bound Rajasthan and  , the governments of  , Assam,  , Jharkhand, Goa, Uttar Pradesh and   also announced cuts by Rs 2.50. Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath hailed the Centre's move as a ""great relief to the common man"". Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal tweeted that his government made the decision to “ease the burden on common people”. Assam minister   said this tax cut will “mean a loss of revenue” of Rs 400 crore for the state.  Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das said he was “grateful from the heart” to Jaitley and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this decision, as it will bring “great relief to the common man”. The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya Pal Malik, too,   in the prices of petrol and diesel, bringing down the rates of fuel by Rs 5 in the state. Ailing Goa chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, too,  . In a veiled statement politicising the subject, the finance minister had said this will be a test for those states whose leaders were only tweeting and indulging in lip sympathy. “Last time also only BJP and NDA-led state governments had reduced VAT. This time, if other state governments don’t do it, then people will question them,"" Jaitley said. While the decisions by the BJP-ruled states was expected, there was also a near immediate refusal by non-BJP states to cut fuel rates. Not giving into the threat of being questioned by the people, the governments of Kerala, Karnataka and Puducherry all made it clear that they will not be following suit and petrol and diesel prices will remain unchanged in the states. The Central government has been refusing to reduce the excise duty on fuel since May when the rates of petrol and diesel first surged and then again from mid-August. To bring some relief to citizens, three states had reduced fuel rates in August, including West Bengal. On Thursday, however, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said a fuel price cut of at least Rs 10 per litre was needed in the current scenario. ""This government at the Centre is not bothered about the well-being of the masses... They are only interested about their party,"" she said.

Press Trust of India," Eight months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi rebuffed him for similar remarks, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said Thursday ""not even a dog"" from the homes of RSS and BJP leaders had died for the country's independence.

Press Trust of India," Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu said on Thursday an Opposition alternative to the BJP-led NDA will emerge ""automatically"" even without its prime ministerial face being declared for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Naidu, a former BJP ally who quit the NDA early this year over the Centre's refusal to grant special status to Andhra Pradesh, also offered to play a ""pivotal"" role to bring all the Opposition parties together to forge a united front. ""An alternative (front) will emerge automatically. People are angry with the Modi government and they will choose an alternative,"" Naidu, 68, told   in an exclusive interview. Naidu also felt non-selection of a prime ministerial candidate by an Opposition front ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls will not hurt its prospects. ""I do not visualise any problem if the PM candidate of the opposition front is not decided before the polls."" ""As a responsible citizen, I will work out (an alternative). Definitely I will play my role as a responsible citizen. We will be instrumental in bringing all parties together who are keen to work in the interest of the nation,"" Naidu said.

""No one could predict a prime ministerial candidate in some past situations."" He felt the choice of the prime ministerial candidate will depend on various circumstances. At the same time, he said it will not be prudent to declare the candidate before the polls as sometimes the plans to forge an Opposition alliance could get sabotaged. ""Whoever emerges as consensus will be the one. If there is a consensus before the poll, it is great,"" he said. Asked if he is in the race for the prime ministerial post, Naidu said, ""I will never go to the Centre. I have never been an aspirant for any post or for any role at the Centre."" Asked how an alternative Opposition front plans to defeat the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, Naidu said, ""I have been in the politics for the last 40 years. I became chief minister in 1995 and worked in the NDA and UPA. I have seen it all."" ""The situation has never been so bad. The country is in a miserable state now. This government has failed in its duty towards people. They will choose an alternative.""

Press Trust of India,": The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Thursday alleged that the Congress was ""forcing"" people to attend Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's rally on 7 October at Lambi. Singh will hold the rally at Lambi, home turf of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, to take on him over his ""misleading claims"" on sacrilege incidents, while Akali will hold a rally at Patiala, Singh's home constituency on the same day. ""Congress party's desperation to put up a face saving show at Lambi after getting unnerved by the SAD's historic rally at Faridkot has paralysed government functioning with seven ministers camping at Lambi to force people to come to its aimless and bogus show on 7 October,"" senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said in a statement in Chandigarh.

Indo-Asian News Service," The Congress has termed as ""double-standards"" the reported assurance of the Indian government to Bangladesh not to deport the people whose names did not figure in the NRC, saying the BJP has consistently called such people infiltrators.

Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said, ""Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) has announced Rs 2.50 cuts in petrol and diesel prices. Reciprocating positively to the finance minister's announcement, the government of Gujarat has also decided to reduce Rs 2.50 on both petrol and diesel.

First, we will see the order and then make a decision on petrol and diesel. Each and every state has its own situation, so first let the letter come.""

Press Trust of India,"Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the Congress allegations of reduction in the number of Rafale jets being purchased from France is baseless and asserted the Modi government is in fact buying 36 fighter jets in fly-away condition as against 18 proposed during the UPA regime. The Congress has demanded the government explain why instead of 126 Rafale fighter jets, only 36 are being purchased if they were cheaper under the NDA deal than the one worked out by the UPA. Denying suggestions that the controversy around the deal is tarnishing the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, she said the Congress campaign is based on ""baseless"" arguments. The Congress campaign over the Rs 58,000-crore Rafale deal is almost sabotaging the Indian Armed Forces' operational readiness, the minister said. Sitharaman alleged the support for the Congress campaign against Indian Armed Forces is reflected in our ""not-so-friendly"" neighbour Pakistan. ""Look at what the UPA's own deal was. At that time already number of our (IAF's) squadron were reduced to 32-33 from 44. ""In their deal also there was a provision of purchase of 18 fighter jets in fly away conditions, and rest were to be later produced,"" she said, replying to a query on why the number of Rafale being purchased from France was reduced from 126 to 36. ""In fact, we increased the number of fly away condition purchase from one squadron (18) to two squadron (36). Looking at the emergency requirement, when the prime minister went to France, he inquired what can be delivered immediately. ""And on the basis of that this figure (36 jets) was finalised,"" she said, adding the first of the planes will be available to India in September 2019. Regarding the remaining number of fighter aircraft, the defence minister said the procedure to acquire them for the Indian Air Force is going on. ""So the numbers have not been reduced,"" she stressed. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had earlier sought to know why the BJP-led NDA government was buying so few Rafale fighter jets if they were cheaper as claimed by it. Talking to reporters in Tamil Nadu, Chidambaram had said the UPA government had decided to buy 126 Rafale aircraft. ""They claimed that the fighter jet was cheaper... In that case they should tell how they (jets) are cheaper... They are not revealing... Besides, if the cost of the plane is cheaper, then why not buy more jets? Why is the government buying only 36 jets?,"" the former Union minister had said. Asked about the cost of one Rafale fighter jet bought under the NDA deal, Sitharaman said the figure has already been revealed on the floor of Parliament. Asked if the controversy over the deal is tarnishing her government's image, she replied in the negative. ""But I am afraid, the campaign which the Congress is doing, with half truth and baseless arguments, is almost sabotaging Indian Armed Forces' operational readiness. ""And strangely the support for the Congress campaign against our armed forces is reflected from our not-so-friendly neighbour,"" she said, without naming Pakistan. Asked about the perception that armed forces officers are fielded to spell out government's view on defence deals, she said the government neither tells them to speak on any issue nor stops them from speaking on any subject. She declined to elaborate on the statement of Union home minister Rajnath Singh that ""appropriate"" action has been taken to avenge the death of a BSF soldier at the hands of Pakistan.

Indo-Asian News Service," The Rafale fighter jets are being brought to attack Pakistan but the Congress was trying to give a ""weapon"" in Islamabad's hands by questioning the deal, the BJP said on Monday. Addressing a press conference in Delhi at the party headquarters, BJP Spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of speaking in the same tone as Pakistan speaks to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government. ""Whatever India has spoken in United Nations, Pakistan has always protested. But it is unfortunate that a senior Congress leader is openly condemning statement of Sushma Swaraj ji (External Affairs Minister). This is not only against the established Indian traditions but also sounding in tune with Pakistan. Shashi Tharoor, who used the term Hindu Pakistan earlier, seems to be standing with Pakistan,"" he said. His remarks came in the wake of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's criticism of Sushma Swaraj's speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), saying the Pakistan bashing was aimed at the voters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""We want answers from Congress. He (Tharoor) should apologize to the nation for his negative statement,"" he said. Trivedi said if it would have been an isolated incident then it could have considered in a different way. ""But since sometimes back, incidents took place one after the other where the Congress and Pakistan's intent, language and style appears to be on same page,"" he said. Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's criticism of Modi, he said the Congress leaders were using similar words against the prime minister. He also drew similarities between Pakistan's criticism of RSS and Congress President Rahul Gandhi's remarks against RSS in which he compared the saffron organisation with Muslim Brotherhood. ""  (When the issue of Rafale comes, the Congress speaks in the the same language as Pakistan speaks. Rafale has been brought to attack Pakistan and they are trying to give a weapon in the hands of the Pakistan...question arises..why is it?),"" Trivedi said. He also hit out at Congress saying Mahatma Gandhi was called Father of Nation, not father of Congress party. ""Rahul's Congress has lost the moral rights to be called the Congress of Mahatma Gandhi. The Congress' thinking has got degenerated,"" he said. The BJP leader also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi, saying his entire projection of being a Shiv Bhakt was a farce. ""A news has come that in Prayag three Congress workers have been expelled from the party for raising slogans of 'Har Har Mahadev' and 'Bam Bam Bhole', said Trivedi, claimed that it suggested Gandhi's entire projection of being a Shiv Bhakt was a farce.

Press Trust of India,": Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari Monday told the Supreme Court that he had broken the seal of a premises here as a ""symbolic protest"" against the illegal action of officials of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and was willing to accept the role of 'sealing officer' as suggested by the apex court. He said he was willing to assist in executing the directions with regard to sealing and if the court-mandated monitoring committee was dissolved, he would make the city a ""better liveable and lawful place"" within four years. Tiwari, a Member of Parliament from the north-east Delhi constituency, said he had not ""disobeyed"" any orders of the apex court. Tiwari, against whom the apex court has issued a contempt notice for allegedly breaking the seal of a premises which was being run in violation of the Delhi Master Plan, claimed that the monitoring committee and EDMC were misusing the authority of the court by trying to sensationalise the whole issue. In an affidavit filed in the court, he said that no contempt was committed by him as he has not disobeyed the orders of either the court or the monitoring committee, and EDMC officials had sealed a premises in Gokalpuri area without following ""due process of law"". He has also referred to the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act 2011, and said that this law extends the protection to unauthorised colonies across the city from sealing and demolition action. ""The deponent (Tiwari) had broken the EDMC seal as a symbolic protest against the illegal action of the EDMC officials as they carried out the sealing action contrary to the specific provisions of law and also contrary to the principles of natural justice,"" he has said in his affidavit. He further said that since the sealing action in the case was not initiated under the orders of the court or under the direction of monitoring committee, no contempt was committed by him. ""It is most respectfully submitted that if this court dismisses/dissolves the monitoring committee, the deponent (Tiwari) shall, as a 'sealing officer', make this city a better liveable and lawful place within four years,"" he said, adding that he would not adopt a ""pick and choose"" method in doing the work. He has claimed that the EDMC has dragged the monitoring committee in the matter with a sole intention to gather ""media glare and publicise"" the whole issue. He said that on September 16, when he had gone for a visit in his constituency, he came to know about the sealing of an alleged ""illegal dairy"", and when he inquired from EDMC officials about it, they were not ready to offer any satisfactory explanation. ""Since no explanation was coming forth from the authorities, the mob which had gathered there, were turning violent against the illegal sealing action. Hence as the representative of the area, the deponent (Tiwari) was forced to take some affirmative protest action against the illegal sealing in order to control the agitated mob,"" he said. ""Otherwise there would have been many untoward incidents. Hence, in order to control the mob and to prevent the law and order situation, the deponent (Tiwari) was forced to do symbolic affirmative protest action against the illegal sealing action done by the EDMC officials,"" he said. He has claimed that the monitoring committee was set up by the apex court to oversee implementation of orders of the court but it was never the scope of the panel to take actions, in unauthorised colonies since they are protected under the 2011 Act. ""The officials of the corporation under the garb of the monitoring committee is acting in an absolutely arbitrary manner and creating terror in the mind of the general public,"" he has said in his affidavit. Accusing the authorities for adopting 'pick and choose' method, the MP has questioned as to why no actions have been taken in areas like Okhla, Jamia, Shahin Bagh, Noor Nagar, Johari Farms having five to seven storeyed buildings. ""If the authorities are acting without following the rule of law, without complying with the principles of natural justice, the public at large will be forced to take laws in their hands and if such a situation arise, neither the political leaders nor the courts or the authorities concerned will be in a position to stop the public,"" he said. Tiwari termed the situation as ""some what identical"" to the situation in the pre-independence era where Mahatma Gandhi was forced to call for the 'civil disobedience movement'. He also claimed that the monitoring committee was acting in ""an absolute arbitrary manner and abusing the powers"" conferred on it by the apex court. Claiming that he has not disobeyed any orders of the apex court, Tiwari has urged the court to drop the contempt notice issued against him. On 25 September, Tiwari had appeared before a bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur in pursuance to the contempt notice issued to him for allegedly breaking the seal of a premises. The court had directed him to file an affidavit within a week explaining why contempt proceedings not be initiated against him.

FP Staff,"Karnataka minister and brother of Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, HD Revanna is in the midst of a fresh controversy once again. The Minister of Public Works Department decided to shuffle the postings of officials in the department, but what caused discontent amid staff and raised alarm in the Congress camp was the unprecedented transfer of 700 officials in a single day. The move apparently rattled Congress ministers, who lined up at the Chief Minister's Office to take up the issue with Kumaraswamy. According to local website   several senior Congress leaders, including at least five ministers and a dozen MLAs, met Kumaraswamy on Monday and urged the chief minister to stall all transfers of PWD officials immediately. The report quoted Congress sources as saying that a message was relayed to the chief minister that if his brother does not mend his ways, the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress alliance government may ""fall any time"". Meanwhile, the officials were also miffed that the transfer orders were issued abruptly, that too mid-year. Large-scale reshuffling in postings and ranks are usually pushed to the end of academic and financial years to ensure that families can relocate easily and officials can take charge from their predecessors smoothly. According to  those transferred include 191 assistant engineers, 150 junior assistants, 200 assistant executive engineers, 20 executive engineers, 10 superintending engineers and 130 clerical staff. In July, too, Revanna had undertaken a   exercise, when he had decided to move around 200 engineers from various categories and departments. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has highlighted the issue of transfers in Karnataka, whereas the ruling JD(S) has brushed it aside as a ""routine"" movement. According to  report, Revanna did not make the decision unilaterally, and Kumaraswamy knew about it. A JD(U) MLA was quoted as saying by the newspaper that transfers followed requests from MLAs, ministers and officers, and were a routine move undertaken by any government. In August,   for flinging biscuit packets at flood victims at a relief camp in Karnataka's Hassan district. As the video clip went viral on social media, besides being aired by TV channels, netizens and BJP leaders called Revanna's action insensitive.

Sandip Ghose,"  *** I first heard of ""Bangali Doctors"" in a film on primary healthcare in South Rajasthan. It was a documentary was based on the work of a well-known Udaipur-based NGO, Seva Mandir, and produced by Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, a renowned economist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Little did I expect to encounter this term again several years later in a tribal village of Madhya Pradesh. These ""Bangali Doctors"" are like German silver — neither Bengali nor doctors. They are quacks. I recall from Banerjee's film that the original ""Bangali Doctors"" were half-trained paramedics. They came to came to Rajasthan from Eastern Bihar, then part of larger Bengal. Successive generations adopted the title and also brought along people from their villages over the years. These quacks form a vital link in the healthcare chain. They are the next port of call after the village "" "" (voodoo practitioner). Only after them comes the state primary health centre. We were at the tiny tribal hamlet of Pandutalab in Dewas district, 70 kilometers from Indore. The Mahila Jagat Lihaaz Samiti ran a Communitarian Natural Resource Conservation in the village. It was a field centre of an NGO formed by social activist Rahul Banerjee and his wife Subhadra Khaperde. Rahul, better known as Rahul Indori, is a civil engineer from IIT-Khargapur. He also holds a PhD in environmental planning and management. Subhadra comes from a Dalit marginal farmers' family in Chhattisgarh's Kanker district. She is also a grassroots social worker and activist. The couple has worked among the tribals of Madhya Pradesh on a range of subjects and thus know the lay of the land as well as the back of their hands. Lunch was free-range   chicken curry and a unique tribal-style okra cooked in butter milk. While devouring the food, I asked Rahul about the central government's Ayushman Bharat scheme. I wanted to know whether he thought it would be a game-changer. He was sceptical. He thought it was likely to miss the proverbial wood for the trees. The foundation of a successful public health programme is its primary health outreach. Most illnesses start as primary health problems. They need immediate attention, otherwise they escalate into emergencies or chronic health problems. The government-fun primary health infrastructure in rural areas is inadequate and dysfunctional. Therein lies the menace of quacks and ""Bangali Doctors"". After three terms of Shivaraj Singh Chauhan as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, this was appalling. Will this lack of development work against him? The community members working in the farm are not so sure. First, a few of them understand the difference between good and poor healthcare. Caught in a time warp and lacking exposure, they accept it as their lot. What matters to them is money, and "" "" has showered them in cash in the recent months. Among them, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna was a big hit. It is another matter that the village headman took Rs 20,000 in cash for every application cleared. Still, a roof over their head makes a world of difference. But is this enough to secure their votes? Much depends on the selection of candidates and ground mobilisation. The Congress does have presence in the region. But like most places, it is faction ridden. While the BJP seems ahead right now, a ""wave"" could change this fact. Back in Indore, given a choice between   and  , I am partial towards the latter. The best was to please an Indori, I discovered, is by saying that their   is better than what they make in Pune. That puts their guard down for all tricky questions. At first, they deflect the question towards the Lok Sabha polls, saying, ""No one can stop Modi- ."" But when pinned down to the Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, they say, "" (there's no problem in Malwa)."" The earlier bravado is missing. "" ."" The stress on the east and central regions are real. If they are correct, BJP president Amit Shah's rallies in the east are on hold. The party is waiting for the "" "" to change. Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath is giving his all to these elections and will make a difference in Chindhwara and its adjoining regions. To counter the Congress strategy, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has stepped up its booth-level work. They have now assigned two workers at every booth to cater to 50 voters as against one booth worker earlier. While technology and digital outreach will be a force multiplier for the RSS, the Congress is not sparing any money or efforts either. The BJP's confidence seems to stem from two counts. First, the huge sums Chouhan has doled out under the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana on minimum support price (MSP). Farmers have had a good soya bean yield and reaped a double bonanza with the MSP scheme. Other minor sops, such as capping electricity bills for farmers at Rs 200, have been good draws, as well. But not everyone is happy with "" "" generosity. The trading community that had to bear the brunt of the Goods and Services Tax believe it is their money that is funding these doles — a case of robbing ""Pappu"" to pay ""Pidi"" that they don't like. It is here that Congress leader Digvijaya Singh comes to the rescue of BJP loyalists. They are confident that as long as Singh is around, Congress unity is going to remain a mirage. The highway from Indore to Ratlam is not in the best condition at the moment. Although not better than the US beltways — as Chouhan had claimed — it is still one of the best roads in the country. Having sized me up by now, the driver was quick to recall the condition of the roads during Singh's tenure. Only for that, people should not vote for the Congress, he remonstrated. He must have suffered in those times, and the memory was still raw, I thought. An eternal point of difference between the folks of Indore and Ratlam is the quality of the  . Residents of Ratlam claim that their products are superior beause of the quality of the local water. I am not a   connoisseur to be able to pass judgement, but on this trip, I found that there was divergence in their political views, as well. On the day of my trip, a central minister was visiting the nearby towns of Alote and Taal for rallies. At both places, the towns traders called for shutters to be downed as a mark of protest, unhappy with amendment to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The anger is swelling. If allowed to gather momentum, it will make a heavy dent in the BJP’s upper-caste vote bank. Contrary to popular perception, Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party contesting the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls solo may benefit the Congress. It will split any gains the BJP was hoping to make with SC/ST votes. So it is a potential double whammy for the BJP that has left its most die-hard supporters flummoxed. A couple of my old associates from Mandsaur were down. I asked them whether there was any residual strains of the riots last year. They smiled and said everyone knew the real story. Last year, there was a bumper crop of opium. According to my associates, the opium mafia had engineered the riots, which provided them cover to smuggle out the excess (undeclared) yield. The state erred in its assessment, and the situation went out of hand. ""  (everything is peaceful now). With a bountiful of soya crop and MSP, there is real  now, they said, punning on the word to imply a change of mood. On the way back to Indore, I stopped for a tea break at the small town of Badnawar. The shop owner we called upon was very clear about his choice — the memories of Congress misrule were still raw in his mind. He said with a lot of emotion, "" (We're angry with the chief minister, but that doesn't mean we'll hand over the keys to our house to a thief).""

Press Trust of India,"The Congress Working Committee (CWC) Tuesday called for a ""second freedom struggle"" against the Narendra Modi government to combat the ideology of ""hate and violence"", saying the same reason had led to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Holding its meeting at Mahadev Bhavan, Sevagram Ashram, in Wardha district of Maharashtra on the 149th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the CWC also condemned the use of force against protesting farmers on their way to the national capital. Addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the CWC has passed two resolutions recalling the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to the ""Indian thought process, its soul and body"". ""(Former prime minister) Lal Bahadur Shastri's call of ' ' is not just a slogan but a way of life. We will continue to fight for farmers' rights,"" he said. Surjewala said the second freedom struggle will be against the Modi government for practising politics of ""hatred, divisiveness, fear, polarisation, crushing dissent and debates"". ""The Modi government is against India's plurality and is indulging in politics of revenge, falsehood and betrayal. It is easy to talk about Gandhi  in speeches. It's just political opportunism,"" he said. The CWC underscored the hypocrisy of those who vilified Gandhi and his thoughts, but are brazenly championing it now, he said. ""The second freedom struggle will be against the government that practices politics of hate, vendetta, threat, murder, intimidation, crushing healthy debate and dissent,"" he said. ""Farmers who had come to seek grievance redressal were beaten up and lathi charged. Water canons and tear gas was also used. We condemn the autocratic Modi government and the prime minister who is drunk with power. We express solidarity with the farmers and resolve to redress their grievances if voted to power,"" he said.

Debobrat Ghose,"On 14 July, 1942, the Congress Working Committee meeting in Wardha adopted Mahatma Gandhi's proposal to launch the Quit India movement the following month in what became the   to turn the British out of India. On the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma on 2 October, 2018, the Congress Working Committee is revisiting history by meeting in Sevagram Ashram, Wardha, to launch a movement to get the country rid of BJP and the power it wields today. The slogan that has been coined to carry this new 'movement' of the Congress has a catchy ring to it in Hindi —   (War against loot, lies, fear and divisions, Sevagram again). In this crucial election year, Mahatma Gandhi's service to the nation is being pressed into service again by the Congress, the party under whose banner he fought for the country's freedom. Besides, it's a discreet attempt at reclaiming the leader who was appropriated by the BJP with the inauguration of Narendra Modi's tenure in 2014. Political watchers may remember Modi's strong push to claim two prominent Congress leaders of pre-independent India — Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel — for the nation at large, soon after he became the prime minister, leaving the Congress befuddled. The Modi government is getting Patel’s statue— the ‘Statue of Unity’— the world’s tallest statue — built in Gujarat as a tribute to the leader. With ‘Sevagram again’, the Congress is definitely dipping into history to not only reclaim Gandhi as the party's icon but also to perhaps have his ideologies help the party deliver results in the forthcoming elections. Will the history lesson, however, help Congress connect with the electorate that is hungry for clean governance and development? Even though Gandhi continues to be relevant in 21st century India, will the Congress succeed in convincing the electorate about its honesty to follow Gandhi? “Median voters of India are not looking to the past but are concerned about the future. Ninety percent of young Indians will not get influenced by past references that Congress has been trying to use to resurrect party’s future. Rahul Gandhi who’s relatively youthful is saddled with a geriatric team of leaders, which is unfortunate,” MD Nalapat, political analyst and director, department of Geopolitics, Manipal University told  The Congress has planned a series of events to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi. The party will give a call against the Modi government – ‘to free the country from the atmosphere of corruption, fear, intolerance and violence’ at Wardha, on 2 October. The Congress will kick-start the day by offering prayer at Bapu Kutir, Sevagram Ashram. It’ll be followed by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting at 12.30 pm at the same venue. According to sources, the party after remembering the contribution of Gandhi in the nation’s freedom struggle may pass a resolution against the BJP-led government at the Centre for the alleged rise in intolerance, violence and an atmosphere of fear. After garlanding the statue of Gandhi near Collector’s office, a procession in the form of ‘Padyatra’ will be taken out from Babasaheb Ambedkar statue to Circus ground, where a ‘Sankalp Rally’ has been organised. “The CWC had adopted Mahatma Gandhi's proposal to launch the Quit India movement at Wardha on 14 July, 1942 against the then exploitative British rule. Today again there’s a need for a struggle for deliverance from the BJP government, which has become a symbol of corruption, arrogance and exploitation. Today, after 71 years of Independence, following the footsteps of Gandhi, the Congress party led by its president Rahul Gandhi will fight against socio-economic evils like corruption, bank scams, Rafael scam, farmers’ distress, growing unemployment, atrocities against women and dalits, etc, so that people can get rid of BJP rule,” said AICC in-charge, Communication, Randeep Singh Surjewala. Besides Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi are expected to participate in the day’s event along with top party leaders. The party will also   from 2 October. Named as ‘Mission Rs 500 crore’, the campaign will conclude on the birth anniversary of former prime minister Indira Gandhi on 19 November. The Congress party, which had faced a major electoral debacle in 2014 Lok Sabha election, lost one state after another in subsequent years. At present, the party is in power in Punjab, Puducherry and Mizoram, and is an alliance partner in Karnataka. With five state polls around the corner and the forthcoming 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress needs solid issues to take BJP head on. The party’s plan to enter into a pre-poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party in poll-bound states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh has already fallen flat. The Congress also requires to reposition itself as a strong anti-BJP force in order to fulfil its ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) dream. At present, Congress is also failing to create a mass movement like Mahatma Gandhi’s Quit India Movement, to win over voters. However, political pundits may differ with Congress’ justification and strategy of using Mahatma Gandhi and Wardha, to launch an attack against the Modi government. “The fear that Congress is talking about that the people are facing under the present government is due to the harsh bureaucratic laws. Since Independence, the successive Congress governments, instead of bringing any reforms to our system, retained the harsh colonial laws enacted during the British rule. Subsequently, former Union minister P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal during the UPA tenure also introduced harsh laws. The root cause of the problem is the immense and unholy power of the bureaucracy,” said Nalapat. “Today Congress is raising this issue and has announced to go for an agitation programme similar to Quit India Movement because Narendra Modi is the prime minister. Congress is not looking for a change in the root cause, but only in the present leadership. Why Congress was silent during the UPA regime? If they come to power again, the same atmosphere of fear that Congress has been referring to will be there,” he said.",2018-10-01,"BJP,Congress,Congress Working Committee,Mahatma Gandhi,Manmohan Singh,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel,Sevagram Ashram,Sonia Gandhi,Wardha",Congress set to dive into history to reclaim Mahatma Gandhi at Wardha meet as party readies itself to combat Narendra Modi,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-set-to-dive-into-history-to-reclaim-mahatma-gandhi-at-wardha-meet-as-party-readies-itself-to-combat-narendra-modi-5296841.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service," A 40-year-old CPM newspaper in Tripura,  , has been ordered closed by the government on technical grounds, leading the Marxists to accuse the state's BJP government of committing an ""illegal"" act. The west Tripura district magistrate passed an order closing down the Bengali daily, alleging discrepancies in the changeover of the management. Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) leader and the newspaper's founder-editor Gautam Das on Tuesday said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ""pressurised the district magistrate to do the illegal work as the newspaper was critical to the state government's misgovernance and ruling party's undemocratic ways"". The BJP denied the allegations. The District Magistrate and Collector, Sandeep Mahatme, after conducting four hearings between 12 September and 1 October, passed an order on Monday night to suspend publication of the newspaper which began publication in 1978. Das said that since the BJP-IPFT (Indigenous People's Front of Tripura) government came to power in March, massive attacks had been unleashed on Left leaders and cadres. The circulation of   fell to 45,000 per day, leaving 1,000 vendors and hawkers jobless. ""The BJP government tried to stop issue of government advertisements to the newspaper but they could not do so due to an order of the Gauhati High Court,"" Das said. The newspaper was originally owned by CPM. In 2012, the ownership was handed over to a registered society. Last month it was transferred to a newly formed trust. ""All the procedures have been done and everything was conveyed to the Registrar of Newspapers through the district magistrate,"" he added. Terming the Monday action as a ""black day"" for the Indian media, Das said that even during the Emergency in 1975-77 no newspaper was forcibly closed down. ""At the behest of BJP, the district magistrate has done the most undemocratic and illegal act. The district magistrate even violated the judicial procedure,"" the Left leader said. He said the management of the newspaper would soon seek justice from the appropriate forum. He said over 200 journalists and non-journalists would now become jobless. BJP spokesman Mrinal Kanti Deb said the BJP had no hand in the district magistrate's action. ""The CPM had hidden facts about the management. They have cheated the people. The district management has only curbed the illegality of the management of the newspaper,"" Deb told the media. In New Delhi, the CPM said: ""This is a brazen attack on the freedom of the press.

Press Trust of India," The AAP leadership in Delhi on Tuesday asked its MLAs in Punjab to start looking for potential candidates ""with a clean image"" for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In a meeting in the national capital, under the chairmanship of AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, senior leaders of the party discussed several issues, including its preparation for the 2019 polls, reaching out to former leaders. However,the eight dissident  MLAs led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira stayed away from the meeting. The meeting was also attended by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and the party's Punjab in-charge Manish Sisodia. ""We have been asked to look for suitable candidates for 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" AAP legislator from Sunam, Aman Arora, said. ""We will look for candidates with good character and a clean image, and it will be the main criteria for shortlisting a candidate,"" he said. These candidates can be from among volunteers, senior leaders, those who are contributing to the cause of Punjab and are connected with the people and working for them, Arora said. In 2014, the AAP had won four out of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. In the meeting, it was also pointed out that people were angry with the Congress government in Punjab for its alleged failure in honouring its poll promises.The SAD has already been rejected by the people, Arora said. On the issue of persuading the Khaira group, Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said efforts were being made to convince them to come together and fight for Punjab.

Press Trust of India," Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of following divisive politics and making false promises, Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the people ""tried"" the BJP leader but his government ""got punctured"" and it was time to trust the Congress to take India forward. The Congress president invoked Mahatma Gandhi's ideals of adherence to truth and communal harmony to hit out at the Modi government and alleged the prime minister was fighting against the same ideals for which the Father of the Nation sacrificed all his life and took three bullets. Addressing a rally in Wardha to kick off the Congress' programmes in the 150th birth anniversary year of the Father of the Nation, Rahul Gandhi also targeted the Modi government over the Rafale fighter jet deal and on issues related to defaulter businessmen Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya. ""The thieves of India, with the help of Narendra Modi, turned lakhs, crores of black money into white. Modiji took money out of your pockets and put it in the pockets of (fugitive businessmen) Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya,"" he said. ""You tried Modiji (gave a chance to him). The vehicle (the Modi government) failed, got punctured, its engine exploded, it did not work. He broke your trust...now you trust the Congress, the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi to take India forward,"" Rahul Gandhi said at Wardha in Maharashtra, where Mahatma Gandhi's Sevagram Ashram is located. The Congress chief also led a march, covering a part of the four-kilometre distance in his vehicle and the rest on foot, to mark Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and to give a message against what the party called the ""atmosphere of fear"" in the country. Senior party leaders KC Venugopal, RPN Singh, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Jyotiraditya Scindia, state unit president Ashok Chavan, Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and others joined Rahul Gandhi, as he began the march after garlanding a statue of the Father of the Nation near the district collector's office. Rahul Gandhi was greeted by thousands of people who waved at him and jostled with each other to catch a glimpse of the Congress leader. People as well as Congress workers lined up both sides of the road, giving some tough moments to Gandhi's security personnel. Wardha district has traditionally been a bastion of the Congress. The party leadership was in Sevagram village, located around 10 km from Wardha district headquarters, to attend the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Tuesday. The Congress is seeking return to power at the Centre and also in Maharashtra following its drubbing at the hands of the BJP in last polls. On soaring fuel prices, the Congress chief accused Modi of taking money from the pockets of the common people and putting it in the pockets of ""15-20 richest"" individuals. ""The   (watchman) is doing it and doing it for them (the rich). He (Modi) is not a  , but   (partner in crime),"" he alleged. Reacting to his charges, the BJP said the Congress leader was a ""tape recorder of lies"" and his party's fortunes will go down as swiftly as he resorts to ""falsehoods"" to target the Modi government. Rahul Gandhi accused Modi of insulting Mahatma Gandhi and every citizen of the country by stating in his Independence Day speech that ""nothing had happened in India"" before he became the prime minister. ""Gandhiji talked about uniting the country. Modiji talks about breaking up the people of the country,"" the Congress chief said. He alleged the prime minister pitched one religion against another, one community against another and spread hatred among people. ""Gandhiji insisted on speaking the truth...I want to ask you, when Modiji made the promise of depositing Rs 15 lakh in the account of every person, was he speaking the truth or did he lie?"" he asked the crowd. The Congress leader alleged Modi also ""lied"" by promising to create two crore jobs every year and giving a fair price for farm produce. ""When I asked Modiji about the Rafale deal (in Parliament), Modiji avoided eye contact. He would look here and there, up and down. But Modiji could not speak by looking the nation in the eye, because he was lying,"" the Congress chief alleged. The Congress chief also accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of writing off loans worth Rs 3.20 lakh crore of ""15-20 richest people"", but not granting loan waiver to farmers. He promised that his party would waive farm loans if it was elected to power. On demonetisation, Rahul Gandhi said, ""all the friends"" of the prime minister entered the banks ""through the back door"" and turned their black money into white, while the common people lined up outside the banks to deposit the scrapped currency. ""The thieves of India, with the help of Narendra Modi, turned lakhs, crores of black money into white.

Sameer Yasir,"For the first time in the electoral history of Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to take control of, at least, seven municipal committees in Kashmir Valley unopposed in the elections. This comes after the two main regional parties — National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party — decided to boycott the urban local body polls in protest against the Centre's plan to scrap the special status of the state. At least 60 candidates of the BJP have won their seats unopposed, and a majority of them fall in the volatile region of south Kashmir where, out of 20 municipalities in five districts, only four are likely to go to polls. The municipalities which are likely to be headed by BJP candidates are Devsar, Qazigund, Pahalgam, and Ashmuqam in south Kashmir, and Shopian and Sopore towns of north Kashmir. ""We have 350 candidates contesting in 600 municipal wards spread across 10 districts of the Valley. Our 60 candidates have won without fighting the elections. Out of them, six are Kashmiri Pandits,” Altaf Thakur, the BJP's spokesperson in Srinagar, said on Tuesday at his office. ""After the first phase of nominations for elections was over, the rush of the candidates increased. We had to select among dozens of candidates. People have reposed faith in democracy and we will live up to their expectations,"" Thakur said. The 624 wards in Jammu and Kashmir are scheduled to go for the four-phase polls from 8 to 16 October. The National Conference and PDP’s decision to not fight the elections seems to have played a big role in handing over these municipalities on a platter to the BJP. What has surprised many is the Congress’ inability to field candidates in many of the seats in one of the most volatile seats of Sopore which is represented in the state Assembly by the Congress. ""There is an atmosphere of fear in Sopore town and its adjoining areas, especially after a spate of mysterious killings due to which we could not find any candidate,"" a senior Congress leader said, wishing anonymity. On 29 September, the biggest surprise came when a former militant, Farooq Ahmad Khan, alias Saifullah, who gave up arms under the 2010 rehabilitation policy announced by the Omar Abdullah government for Kashmiri militants living in Pakistan, was selected as a candidate from old city Srinagar city. Khan says there is no problem in being a former militant who gave up the path of violence and wants to lead a normal life. ""After I came back (from across the LoC) under the rehabilitation policy, people like me have been facing many hardships. Some have even committed suicide. Even children of many returnees were not allowed to join schools,"" he said. ""People might ask why I fought on a BJP ticket but I would like to tell them that unless and until we engage with the political circumstances surrounding us, nothing will be solved. And I will work with dedication for the people who were given false hopes in all these years,” Khan said. The municipal polls will be held in four phases across Jammu and Kashmir on 8, 10, 13 and 16 October in which 16,97,291 electors are eligible to vote in around 1,145 wards. The biggest militant organisation in the Valley, Hizbul Mujahideen, has threatened to carry out acid attacks against people who contest in the elections and those who file nomination papers. Without taking any risk, many candidates, particularly from south Kashmir, were put up in hotels in Srinagar, the capital, by the state administration. The state government also announced recently that the candidates, who will contest the municipal and Panchayat polls, will be covered under an attractive life insurance policy.

Sanjay Singh,"At Sevagram in Wardha, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi  on Tuesday. The pictures were purposefully leaked by an insider to the media to suggest that mother and son, former and serving Congress president, were committed to the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. That, perhaps was their way to associate with Mahatma’s thrust on   (cleanliness) and self-help. In politics, symbolism carries meaning, but it becomes meaningful only if such acts are followed by some plan of action, effective work on the ground and a continued adherence in life. What concerns people at large, polity and Indian society, is the resolution officially adopted by the Congress Working Committee under chairmanship of Rahul—in the presence of Sonia, the guiding light of party—that Congress is launching a second Independence movement to oust the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, just as the Congress launched the Quit India movement against the British in 1942, under the leadership of the Mahatma. The Congress resolution passed on Tuesday notes at the outset: “At the end of its intensive nine-day meeting at Sevagram, the CWC on 14 July, 1942, adopted the ‘Quit India’ resolution demanding immediate independence for our country... Today, a new freedom struggle is the urgent need of the hour—a massive movement to combat the forces of divisiveness and prejudice, to confront the Modi government whose politics is the politics of threat and intimidation, the politics of polarisation and divisiveness, the politics of crushing debate and dissent, the politics of imposing an artificial uniformity in a nation of extraordinary diversity, the politics of hate and vendetta, the politics of subverting all constitutional values, principles and practices, the politics of lies, deceit, fraud and subterfuge.” The way the Congress planned their Wardha programme and drafted their resolution gives one the sense that the party wants to put their chief on same pedestal as the Mahatma and expects him to engender the same sort of mass mobilisation against Modi and the BJP as the Mahatma did against the British. In effect, post May 2019, the Congress wants a Modi-  Bharat. After all the criticism it made against Modi for his 2014 poll catch phrase (Congress-  Bharat), the Congress leadership is attempting to treat the same path, albeit without saying it in as many words. The question: Does the Congress resolution to launch a second independence movement have the desired popular support? So far, the people have not responded to Rahul’s angry outbursts against Modi:“Gabbar Singh”, “sainiko ke khoon ki dalali”, “Hindustan ka chowkidar chor hai”, “thug ka sardar” and so on. The last parliamentary election and state Assembly elections in in two dozen states since 2014 proved that the people have rejected the Congress chief's call and reposed their faith in Modi. Neither the Congress resolution, nor Rahul’s speech at the meet, outlined how it would unleash a second independence movement to throw the Modi-led BJP out of power. Its resolution gave a slight hint: “The Quit India Movement launched under leadership of Mahatma Gandhi was an unprecedented, spontaneous peoples’ uprising to bring freedom for our country from colonial rule.” Ironically, around the time Congress brass were meeting in Sevagram to lay claim to be the rightful inheritors of the Mahatma’s legacy, Modi was holding a programme of public significance: Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention where United Nations Secretary General, representatives of 50 nations and a lot of people working in this area from various parts of the country were present. Modi marked the 149th birth anniversary of the Mahatma with the pledge that India will be clean and free from open defecation by 2 October, 2019. Modi’s Swachh Bharat programme is centered around the Mahatma's philosophy of cleanliness. To show his respect for the Mahatma, Modi personally escorted foreign dignitaries such as Chinese president XI Jinping and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe to Gujarat's Sabarmati Ashram. Congress leadership realises Modi is trying to appropriate the Mahatma's legacy, or is at the very least, trying not to allow the Congress to be the sole inheritor of his legacy. It party’s resolution said: “The CWC notes that appropriating Mahatma’s legacy may be politically expedient for some, but imbibing his principles and values in thought, word and deed is impossible for those who see in the Mahatma only electoral opportunities. One may borrow the Mahatma’s spectacles (Swachh Bharat logo) for publicity campaigns, but implementing his vision will remain unfulfilled unless his principles are followed.” The Congress has only five to six months to turn its Wardha resolution of a “new freedom movement”into a popular resolve to throw Modi and BJP out of power. For a change, the burden of expectations will be on Rahul.",2018-10-03,"BJP,Congress,Congress Working Committee,InMyOpinion,Mahatma Gandhi,Manmohan Singh,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel,Sevagram Ashram,Sonia Gandhi,Wardha",Congress calls for 'second freedom struggle' against Modi govt: Rahul running out of time to convert resolution into revolution,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-calls-for-second-freedom-struggle-against-modi-govt-rahul-running-out-of-time-to-convert-resolution-into-revolution-5310691.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": NCP general secretary Munaf Hakim Friday said he had quit the primary membership of the party and claimed it was ""difficult"" to defend its image after Sharad Pawar ""supported"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rafale fighter jet issue. Pawar, speaking to a television channel Wednesday, said that people ""do not have doubts"" over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intentions (in the Rafale deal). ""I don't think people have doubts about Modi's intentions personally,"" Pawar had told the news channel. Hakim, a former chairman of the Maharashtra State

Press Trust of India," The Congress on Friday hoped that the Maharashtra Police will conduct investigations in the Bhima Koregaon violence case as per the law and not according to the ""whims and fancies"" of the BJP. The Supreme Court on Friday refused to interfere with the arrest of the five rights activists in connection with the case and declined to appoint a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe their arrest. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in a 2:1 verdict, refused the plea filed by noted historian Romila Thapar and others, seeking the immediate release of the activists. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the apex court has decided that police will conduct the investigations in the case and no one can be held guilty before conviction in a court. ""We hope that any person who is found in any clandestine activity against the Indian state would be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law rather than according to the whims and fancies of (BJP chief) Amit Shah who has already seen the writing on the wall in the five election-bound states,"" he told reporters. Polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram are scheduled this year. Therefore, ""frustrated and scared"", Shah, fearing defeat in these poll-bound states, is prone to making intemperate remarks, and the Congress rejects them, he told reporters. Shah, attacking the Congress for its alleged support to Maoists, fake activists and corrupt elements, has said ""there is only   and it's called the Congress"". The BJP chief's response came after the Supreme Court judgment. The Congress leader said, ""I do not think the law or the Constitution permits anyone to be held guilty without the verdict of a court"". Shah has been a ""Tarhipaar"" (externed) and has been in jail. ""He should know what that is — it is only on conviction that anybody is found guilty,"" he said.

Sameer Yasir,"Firstpost ***  As the countdown to elections to urban local bodies (ULB) and panchayats begins, the electoral process in the Kashmir Valley is throwing up surprises with each passing day. While some candidates of the BJP have been elected uncontested from municipal committees in south Kashmir, a ‘youth activist’ has plunged into the electoral fray along with two family members in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district. Baramulla district has two councils, 88 wards and 91,632 voters. The councils will go to the polls on 8 October. Touseef Raina, along with his mother, Fareeda Begum, and brother Shahid ul Islam, are fighting the urban local body elections for the Baramulla municipal committee. After the previous urban local body polls, two sitting councillors of the municipal committee were killed by militants for having participated in the polls. On Friday, Raina, 27, sat along with a group of young boys in a room of a government quarter in Rangwar area of Baramulla to discuss his poll strategy. Decorative balloons hung from the walls. A day earlier, it was Raina’s birthday. The state government gave him official accommodation near a garrison of the Indian Army, which was like a birthday gift for him. The young man, who had once interviewed Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin in Pakistan as a cub reporter, is mindful of the dangers involved in fighting urban local body elections. He said he believes in strengthening the concept of grassroots democracy and empowering people. “I am telling people that those who get elected should be held accountable. My basic focus is strengthening the essence of democracy at the grassroots level,” Raina said with an uneasy smile on his face. Asked why his mother and brother plunged into the fray, he said that many people approached him seeking to become part of his group, but he refused, saying that he could only take care of people who are his family members and some of his friends in case the situation turns ugly. Along with his two family members and three friends, Raina is fighting the election as an independent candidate. “Such is the level of the threat that I thought I could only secure people whom I could accommodate with me if the situation turns bad,” Raina said. The biggest issue, he says, is the development of the town and the banks of the Jhelum river, which passes through Baramulla, “The river bank is filthy, which makes me sad,” he remarked. Raina, a resident of Sangri Colony in Barmaulla town, graduated in journalism in 2014. After a brief stint in journalism, he started the Global Youth Foundation, which he says fights against injustice and for the underprivileged. Raina says that the young generation of Kashmir faces issues which should not be clubbed with the conflict in the region. “For example, the Kashmiri sentiment is with Article 35A and 370, but   and bloodshed have given us nothing. Our leaders need to change their strategy. Every day, our youth are being killed.” The decision of the two biggest political parties, National Conference and PDP, to boycott the polls has opened up the electoral field for many new faces, including the BJP. It is for the first time that the saffron party has won an election uncontested in the Kashmir Valley. The boycott by regional parties has turned the tide in favour of the BJP, which has fielded candidates from almost every constituency. Five BJP candidates were declared elected in the absence of any opponent in the municipal elections from the volatile region of south Kashmir. According to BJP leaders, the party's candidates won uncontested two seats of Achabal, two seats of Kulgam and one seat of Devsar municipal committees. With the region reeling under protests and militants threatening to carry out attacks on those who participate in the elections, no other party or independent candidate had filed nomination papers from these wards. The state BJP president Ravinder Raina said the BJP is committed to fighting elections from each and every ward and constituency in Kashmir, “We are hopeful that people will come out and cast their vote. This will help in strengthening grassroots democracy, and people will cherish the fruits of development,” he said. However, the regional parties, who have boycotted the polls, are crying foul, “In absence of the two main political parties, these elections are nothing but a fraud that is being played on the people of Kashmir in the name of democracy,” National Conference leader Nasir Aslam Wani said.",2018-10-04,"Article 35a,Article 370,Baramulla,BJP,ConnectTheDots,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Local Body Polls,Ravindra Raina,Touseef Raina","Jammu and Kashmir local body polls, Part V: Boycott by NC, PDP opens up field for BJP, independents",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-local-body-polls-part-v-boycott-by-nc-pdp-opens-up-field-for-bjp-independents-5287431.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit on Saturday demanded de-recognition and withdrawal of symbol of the parties which have announced that they will boycott the upcoming urban local bodies (ULB) and panchayat polls in the state. ULB elections are scheduled to take place in four phases beginning 8 October and the panchayat polls will be held in November-December in nine phases. Four parties – National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bahujan Samaj Party – have announced that they will be boycotting the polls. ""The BJP urges state chief electoral officer to de-recognise those political parties which have announced (their decision to) boycott ULB and panchayat polls,"" the party's state spokesperson Anil Gupta told reporters. He said NC, PDP, CPM and BSP are state or national level parties with reserved election symbols and are mandated to participate in all elections according to Section 29A(5) of Representation of People Act, 1951. ""Elections are the core of the democratic process and afford people an opportunity to express their will. By boycotting the elections, these political parties have not only betrayed the people of the state but also disrespected the Constitution which they had pledged to safeguard while applying for recognition of their respective political parties,"" he added. Gupta said, ""Suppression of the democratic process by these parties also amounts to gross violation of human rights"". ""The chief electoral officer needs to immediately take up the issue with the Election Commission of India to de-recognise these parties and freeze their election symbols,"" he said. He added he has already filed a petition in this regard. The NC and the PDP are boycotting the polls over Article 35(A), which grants special rights and privileges to the ""permanent residents"" of the state and is facing legal challenge.

Press Trust of India," Nationalist Congress Party's founding member Tariq Anwar Friday quit the party and announced he is giving up his Lok Sabha membership, saying he left aggrieved by the party's national president Sharad Pawar's ""clean chit"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rafale deal. Amid speculation about the veteran Bihar leader's next move ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress said Anwar was ""welcome"" to return to the party from where he started his political career. Anwar was the Bihar Congress president in the 1980s and had represented his current parliamentary constituency Katihar as a Congress MP, before he joined hands with Pawar and deceased Meghalaya leader PA Sangma to form the Nationalist Congress Party in 1999. The NCP later allied with the Congress and Anwar served as a Union minister in the UPA-II government. The announcement, made by Anwar in his parliamentary constituency, is seen as a politically significant development for possible alignments in Bihar, where Congress, NCP and RJD have been part of the 'grand alliance or Mahagathbandhan' against the BJP and its allies. The Mahagathbandhan camp leaders lauded Anwar's decision, with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) urging Pawar to review his stand on the issue. The JD(U), headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and an ally of the BJP, termed Anwar's move opportunistic and aimed at ""greener pastures"". Anwar's Katihar constituency has a large number of Muslim voters and any indication towards his party or party leaders being sympathetic towards the BJP or Modi government could be politically incorrect, party leaders said. Notwithstanding the Modi wave, Anwar had managed to win 2014 Parliamentary poll from Katihar as the NCP had fought at that time in alliance with the RJD and the Congress. In a statement after making the announcement before journalists in Katihar, 67-year-old Anwar said he was resigning from the posts of the NCP's national general secretary and as its leader in the Lok Sabha, besides giving up the party's primary membership and vacating his parliamentary seat. Anwar's move came a day after media reports quoted Pawar having told a Marathi news channel that he did not think people had doubts over the prime minister's intentions in the Rafale fighter plane deal. Pawar's reported statement was lauded by BJP chief Amit Shah who asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to take a cue from his ally and place national interests above party politics. The Congress and other Opposition parties have been targetting Modi and the NDA government over the Rafale deal alleging corruption and crony capitalism. The government has denied the charges. An NCP spokesperson, however, issued a clarification terming the media reports quoting Pawar as ""misleading and confusing"" and claimed the party chief has had not given a clean chit to Modi. 
Anwar, however, said in his statement he was aggrieved by Pawar's statement since Modi has been given a clean chit over his intention despite the prime minister having not cared to prove himself clean in the Rafale deal. Anwar alleged the prime minister is fully involved in the Rafale deal and it was also substantiated by former French President Francois Hollande, referring to his reported remarks about France being left with no option in Dassault selecting Reliance Defence as an offset partner as part of the multi-billion dollar deal. The Bihar leader said he completely disagreed with Pawar's version, which he said has shattered the faith of countrymen in the Opposition. Lauding Anwar's step, senior Congress leader Prem Chand Mishra said his party would be keenly watching his next political move and if he chooses to return to the party (Congress), he would be most welcome. In New Delhi, senior NCP leader and Rajya Sabha MP DP Tripathi confirmed that Anwar has quit the party. RJD spokesman and MLA Bhai Virendra said his party welcomes the bold stand taken by Anwar. ""We urge Sharad Pawar, who is a senior and widely respected leader, to review his stand on the issue,"" he said. JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, however, said Pawar had only aligned himself with the popular sentiment in the country. Calling it an act of opportunism, Prasad said Anwar has quit his party shortly ahead of Lok Sabha polls and, perhaps, he will find ""greener pastures"".",2018-09-28,"Amit Shah,BIhar,BJP,Congress,JD(U),Katihar,NCP,NewsTracker,Rafale,Sharad Pawar,Tariq Anwar","NCP founding member Tariq Anwar quits, says he felt aggrieved by Sharad Pawar's 'clean chit' to Modi in Rafale deal",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ncp-founding-member-tariq-anwar-quits-says-he-felt-aggrieved-by-sharad-pawars-clean-chit-to-modi-in-rafale-deal-5284201.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service,"If you thought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections would be fought by politicians on issues concerning the common citizen, think again! For the politically-crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 220 million people, is all set to see a keen contest of affection for Hindu gods in the mother of all battles in 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a second term for himself. Yes, you got it right, read on. This time, it is Lord Ram yet again for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Lord Shiva for the Congress and Lord Vishnu for the Samajwadi Party (SP) who will spearhead elections in the interesting times that lie ahead of the general elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is also not averse to drumming up support by taking names of Hindu gods and positioning itself beyond the cliched image of being just a party of Dalits. And so it's not just the saffron camp that is sharpening its armory with the name of Lord Ram for 2019. All parties relevant to the contest are on the drawing board trying their best to project themselves as the champions of soft Hindutva and trying to wash away the image of being ""pro-Muslim"", something that hit their image hard in 2014, when Modi, riding on this perception, romped home with a big mandate in the state. While the BJP has once again started the drum-beating on its commitment to the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya and has set its eyes on the team of holy men to help it sail through once again, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliate units like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are working on the ground to ensure a ""repeat of the Hindu wave of the 90s"" when the Ram temple issue was at its peak, paying political and electoral dividends to the BJP. The Congress, which was hurt the most by being portrayed as a party of Muslims, this time is trying very hard to shrug off its image. And so the prefixes of ""Thakur, Pandit, Hindu Hriday Samraat"" can be seen against names of its political stalwarts in hoardings and posters. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, thanks to his many visits to temples in recent times, is now being portrayed by party cadres as a ""Shiv  "" who has just returned from the divine abode of the deity, Kailash Mansarovar. During a recent visit, Rahul was welcomed in his Amethi parliamentary constituency with hundreds of posters showing him as a Shiv  . Small-time party workers and leaders can be seen delivering speeches on how great a Hindu Rahul is and how much he follows the rituals of the religion he belongs to but does not flaunt it on his sleeve. Overzealous Congress supporters seem to be going overboard, as well. This week, the Congress president looked annoyed when he was greeted by party men at the Bamrauli airport in Allahabad with slogans of "" "" (glory to Lord Mahadev). The last time, these slogans became part of campaigning were in Varanasi in 2014 when Modi began his campaign in the holy town. Rahul Gandhi was greeted with slogans of "" "" at Chitrakoot when he visited a temple recently. The BSP has in the past dabbled with slogans like the "" "" (It is not just an elephant [the party symbol] but the trinity of Hindu Gods). This is part of the BSP's effort to break the image of being a Dalit-run dispensation and of working for the "" "" (entire society). ""We will certainly use this slogan again to our benefit,"" a senior party strategist averred. Surprisingly, and interestingly, the SP this time is trying the hardest to maintain its distance, at least overtly, from the Muslim community and not come across as their champions at the cost of Hindus. ""We were wrongly portrayed as a Muslim-appeasing party. This time we are careful and will reply to the rumors of the BJP deftly,"" a senior party leader said. SP chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has publicly announced that he is getting a temple of Lord Vishnu constructed at his native village Saifai. Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya of the BJP chuckled at this ""change of heart"". ""I am happy that he missed no opportunity to appease Muslims but is now chanting the name of Hindu gods... it shows the power of the Hindus,"" he said. Rajya Sabha member and former SP general secretary Amar Singh, however, trashed the "" "" (change of heart) of the SP president and dubbed it a ""drama for votes"". Whom the gods will side with and who will get the blessings of the voters is for time to tell but, for now, the gods are going to be busy in the election season as everybody is wooing and propitiating them for electoral and political dividends.",2018-09-30,"2019 Elections,General Elections,Hindu Gods In Elections,Hindu Rashtra,Hindutva,Lok Sabha Polls,Narendra Modi,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Ram Temple,Shiv Bhakt,Uttar Pradesh","Lord Ram for BJP, Shiva for Congress, Vishnu for SP: Hindu gods likely to take centrestage in UP ahead of 2019 polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/lord-ram-for-bjp-shiva-for-congress-vishnu-for-sp-hindu-gods-likely-to-take-centrestage-in-up-ahead-of-2019-polls-5289591.html,firstpost,-1,0

Indo-Asian News Service,"Over 81 percent of the around 55,000 electorate on Sunday cast their votes in the bypolls to panchayati raj institutions (PRI) in 11 blocks in Tripura, an official said. The Tripura State Election Commission (SEC) and police officials said that except for some minor squabbles in northern parts of the state, no untoward incident was reported from the 11 blocks. The by-elections to 3,386 seats — 3,207 gram panchayat seats, 161 panchayat samiti seats and 18 zilla parishad seats — were scheduled for Sunday, but polling was necessitated only for 11 blocks because most of the seats were filled with candidates elected unopposed. These seats fell vacant after large-scale resignations of elected representatives of the Left and other parties after the BJP-led coalition came to power in Tripura in March. Some of the three-tier panchayat seats were lying vacant, also due to death of PRI representatives. ""The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier won unopposed around 96 percent of the gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats and all 18 zilla parishad seats in Tripura,"" the SEC official said. Nearly all parties, including BJP's junior partner Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), following large-scale violence during electioneering, had been demanding rescheduling of the 30 September panchayat elections to ensure participation of all parties. The Opposition Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM)-led Left Front, the Congress and the IPFT, a tribal-based party, had separately urged the SEC to reschedule the election process as they claimed that ""massive violence prevented their nominees from filing papers"". State BJP spokesperson Mrinal Kanti Deb said the Opposition, especially the CPM, could not find suitable candidates and also that most people are not interested to contest as candidates of Left parties and the Congress. CPM leader Gautam Das told the media: ""There was no conducive atmosphere for holding free and fair elections. Out of 35 blocks, non-BJP parties were not allowed to file nominations by supporters of the ruling party in 28 blocks. That's why we were demanding rescheduling of the panchayat elections, but the state poll panel did nothing positive.""",2018-09-30,"BJP,Congress,CPI(M),Gram Panchayat,IPFT,Left Front,NewsTracker,Panchayat Polls,Tripura,Tripura Bypolls,Tripura Panchayat Polls,Zilla Parishad",Tripura panchayat bypolls record over 81% voter turnout; 'minor squabbles' reported from northern parts,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/tripura-panchayat-bypolls-record-over-81-voter-turnout-minor-squabbles-reported-from-northern-parts-5290851.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi had a meeting with the newly-constituted West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) and its new chief Somen Mitra on Saturday. The signals that the meeting seemed to send out seem, at first sight, equivocal. When Mitra replaced Adhir Choudhury on 21 September as PCC president, the appointment was widely seen as an attempt to clear the decks for an understanding with the Trinamool Congress. Chowdhury has always been steadfastly against the Trinamool Congress and his personal animosity against its boss Mamata Banerjee is well known. Mitra is, however, seen as a more flexible leader. Even though Mamata parted ways with the Congress while he was president of the Bengal unit of the Congress, he had later left the party and briefly joined the Trinamool as well. He thus has connections with the ruling party. On assuming office, Mitra had initially been guarded. He had not categorically ruled out the possibility of joining hands with the Trinamool, but he had said that even though an alliance with the party would yield fruits in the short term, it would not be wise when seen from a long-term perspective. He had also said that the Congress needed to steady its ship before entering into any alliance. Rahul seems to have echoed that sentiment at Saturday's meeting. It has been reported that leaders present at the meeting later said that the party president made a few important points: First, Mitra said, he made it clear that the central leadership would not impose its views on the state unit of the party because he understood that a top-down approach would not work; second, he stressed that the party should not compromise on its 'dignity' while negotiating a prospective alliance. Rahul is reported to have said that even if the party failed to get a single seat in Bengal to maintain its dignity, it would be acceptable. After the meeting, Mitra reiterated his position that the party must find its feet before thinking about an alliance, which suggests that this view was endorsed by the party president. All this rhetoric about dignity and self-sufficiency may sound good, but it hardly masks the fact that the Congress has a long way to go before it finds its feet in Bengal. It won't happen in anything resembling a hurry — certainly not before the time comes to take hard decisions in the context of the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The facts speak for themselves. The Congress had a presence in only two districts: Malda and Murshidabad. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, its voteshare was just under 10 percent, less than that of the Left Front or Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It got four seats (the Left Front and BJP got two each) because its votes are concentrated in these two districts. In the 2016 Assembly election, its voteshare was 12.3 percent, but it was in an alliance with the Left Front, which doubtless boosted the share of its vote. In the interim, several things have changed. In this year's   elections, the BJP emerged as the second largest party in Bengal and the only credible opponents of the Trinamool Congress, supplanting the Left Front. Although the dynamics of the   and Lok Sabha are obviously different, no one seriously doubts that the outcome of this year's elections will be replicated in 2019. More important, the Trinamool Congress has destroyed the parent party's redoubts in Malda and Murshidabad. In Murshidabad, the Congress was wiped out, with the BJP limping to the finish line way behind the ruling party. In Malda, it fared somewhat better, but it is clear that the Trinamool now holds the whip hand in that district as well, with the BJP eating into Congress support. If the Congress decides to fly solo, it is unlikely that it will win anything in Bengal; Rahul's zero out of 42 seats worst-case projection could play itself out. It may, at best, win one seat. Even if the party ties up with the Left Front, its prospects don't look great. The combined voteshare of the two was 31 percent in 2016. Since then, both the Left and the Congress have significantly lost ground — the first to the BJP and the second to the Trinamool. If the Congress decides against entering an alliance with the Trinamool, it will succeed in inconveniencing the ruling party to some extent, especially considering the fact that the BJP's challenge is becoming more credible even though it is far yet from being a real threat. The Congress has to contribute saliently towards stitching together a nationwide Opposition alliance against the BJP. Who can contribute more to this enterprise? The Left, which is likely to win not more than 10 seats in 2019, or the Trinamool, which is likely to get around 40 seats? The Congress 'high command' must ask of itself a fundamental question: Is it worth pursuing the chimera of self-sufficiency in Bengal just to make a point at the cost of losing a valuable ally on the national stage? The answers will, or should be, plain to the high command, which is why, presumably, Chowdhury was replaced with Mitra. One does not know what Mitra was thinking when he reported Rahul's reluctance to impose New Delhi's views on the PCC, but from where we stand it does sound like a bit of a joke. The Congress high command has been imposing its views and leaders, like Mitra, on PCCs for four decades or so. Nothing has happened that we have been informed about yet that could have transformed the Congress party into a party imbued with the spirit of inner-party democracy. Don't be surprised, then, if Rahul's next significant statement on Bengal announces an alliance with the Trinamool Congress.",2018-10-01,"Adhir Choudhury,BJP,Congress,Left Front,Mamata Banerjee,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Somen Mitra,Trinamool Congress,West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee",Rahul Gandhi meets new Congress West Bengal state unit: Party president doesn't rule out tie-up with TMC in 2019,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-meets-new-congress-west-bengal-state-unit-party-president-doesnt-rule-out-tie-up-with-tmc-in-2019-5292071.html,firstpost,-1,0
Debobrat Ghose,"In an election year, when nothing is more important than votes, Congress president Rahul Gandhi doesn't seem to be getting a handle on which vote bank to woo and to what extent. He has tried to   on several occasions recently. The latest attempt has been to show his devotion to Lord Ram. With Rahul too jumping into the Ram melee, it would be interesting to see who eventually benefits from it — the Congress or the BJP. Interestingly, poll-bound Madhya Pradesh has provided Rahul with a unique platform to experiment and launch himself in several avatars. First, he kicked off his poll campaign in August by visiting the   and paying obeisance to Lord Shiva. Later, after his return from Kailash Mansarovar, he was hailed as a Shiv bhakt, with hoardings put up across Bhopal. Further, at Chitrakoot in Satna, he has been projected as ‘Ram-Bhakt Pandit Rahul Gandhi.’ However, as part of his newly-acquired avatar, will Rahul support the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and take a stand against damaging the 'Ram Setu' for the Sethusamudram project? Such political positions will be contrary to those that the Congress has taken in the past. According to political pundits, Rahul’s approach towards soft Hindutva is an effort to come out of the clutches of the Congress’ traditional ""Nehruvian secularism"" and win over Hindu voters. “Through his new avatars, Rahul wants to communicate to voters that while he is the president of the ""secular"" Congress, he is not anti-Hindu. During the UPA regime, the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi followed Nehruvian secularism and sided with the Wahabis, who form only 2 percent of the Muslim population in India. This led to resentment among the majority community and moderate Muslims; and the Congress is paying the price,” MD Nalapat, political analyst and a professor of geopolitics at Manipal University, told  . “After having adopted this new avatar, Rahul ought to get into action and publicly clear his stand on the Ram Mandir and Ram Setu. It would be cheap politics to merely resort to narratives in election rallies and take no positive action. On the one hand, he projects himself as a Ram-bhakt, and on the other hand, he attacks Narendra Modi and the BJP on the Ram Mandir issue,” he said. Indeed, the Congress campaign in Madhya Pradesh this time borrows heavily from the BJP repertoire. Besides Rahul, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh completed a ‘Narmada Yatra’ and promised to build a ‘Sri Ram Van Gaman Path’ that the BJP never did. State Congress chief Kamal Nath has promised to build a cow shelter in every panchayat in the state. “The Congress, which has come under pressure from the RSS and BJP, has been talking of soft Hindutva, and has sought to put on a cloak of liberal Hinduism. This move is nothing but an attempt to win Hindu voters, while keeping an eye on the upcoming elections to the state Assembly and the Lok Sabha. However, people will come to know the party's real face. The Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, has been compelled to follow this path because its policy of appeasement did not bring welfare to Muslims. At the same time, this policy alienated Hindu voters,” Anil Saumitra, Madhya Pradesh BJP convener and media relations in-charge, told  . Bhopal-based senior journalist Prabhu Pateria added, “The Congress is following the BJP line to win over voters from the majority community. The party wants to get rid of its ‘secular’ tag that has proved to be damaging for it. The Congress now wants to identify itself with the majority community. Therefore, Rahul Gandhi has visited temples, participated in the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, become a Shiv-bhakt and Ram-bhakt, and performed Kanya-pujan—which ways to assert Hindu symbolism. Now, the Congress wants to create a new image for itself based on secularism and soft Hindutva. But to what extent it will pay off remains to be seen."" Ironically, it was Rahul's father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi who stirred the hornet's nest of politics over Lord Ram in the first place. It was he who got the doors of the Ram Lalla temple unlocked in 1986 and allowed devotees to offer prayers there daily. This move came in the aftermath of the Shah Bano case, after which the BJP and Sangh Parivar had accused him of minority appeasement. “Rajiv Gandhi did not have the mechanism to put his modern ideas into practice due to the people around him. His ideas got sabotaged,” remarked Nalapat. Though the Congress government unlocked the Ram Lalla temple, it was the BJP which reaped benefits from it. Rahul's new avatars may mean several things to several people. But it definitely proves one thing — that the BJP's success in the complicated game of elections has forced even the avowedly secular Congress to embrace Hindu symbolism blatantly. Never in recent memory has a Congress president openly declared his religious credentials favouring one religion over another. Clearly, vote bank politics muddles all ideologies and the Congress, with its support having declined in the past five years, has fired a shot in the dark. The Congress, which is trying to refashion itself, faces a challenging task of juggling secularism and Hindutva. “Rahul needs to come out of the shadow of the UPA in order to establish himself as the leader of the new Congress, a party in which people can have faith. As of now, Rahul’s Congress is nothing but UPA-III, with most leaders from the UPA regime still present. How can people accept that the ‘corrupt UPA’ is claiming to fight against corruption? Rahul also must make his stand clear on secularism. This is a big challenge for the Congress,” added Nalapat. In the past, all mainstream political parties except the BJP had shunned the Hindutva narrative like the plague. It remains to be seen if the Congress president's evident attempt to foreground his Hindu identity will change the party's electoral fortunes.",2018-10-26,"Assembly Election 2018,BJP,Congress,Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Omkareshwar Temple,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Ram Temple,Secularism",Rahul Gandhi tests 'soft Hindutva' in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh as Congress borrows heavily from BJP's electoral strategy,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-tests-soft-hindutva-in-poll-bound-madhya-pradesh-as-congress-borrows-heavily-from-bjps-electoral-strategy-5283511.html,firstpost,-1,0

TS Sudhir,"Is this the Telangana version of the cash-for-votes template perfected in the Tamil Nadu elections? The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) candidate from Yellareddy constituency, E Ravinder Reddy was caught on camera negotiating a deal with a group of women for Rs 5 lakh. He wanted 50 such women groups to take an oath while passing a resolution that all of them will vote for the TRS candidate in the   in Telangana. ""Organise meetings with 50 groups. You should unanimously take an oath that you will vote for the TRS and I will give you Rs 5 lakh,'' Reddy is heard saying in the video that is being circulated over social media. ""Will it be possible with Rs five lakh, sir?'' the women are heard bargaining, asking for more money. At which point, one of Reddy's aides chips in to ask the women to do this first, as if holding the carrot of giving more money once the work is done. On 24 September, Ravinder Reddy's Facebook page posted photographs of a group of people from Ramreddy mandal, promising to support him. It is difficult not to put two and two together. In the last couple of weeks, several groups in select villages in constituencies in Telangana have adopted this modus operandi in favour of the TRS. It started with Telangana irrigation minister Harish Rao, who is also chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's nephew, in his Siddipet constituency. Rao has represented Siddipet since 2004. Whatsapp groups were flooded with pictures and videos of resolutions passed by villagers in favour of Harish Rao. Half a dozen community groups also pooled in Rs 30,000 to contribute to the nomination amount that Rao would have to submit along with his candidature papers. Transport minister Mahender Reddy followed suit with a group of Muslims taking a similar oath inside a mosque in Tandur constituency. The decision to indulge in political activity inside a place of worship came in for criticism, forcing the person who had organised the oath-taking ceremony to apologise. Armoor TRS candidate Jeevan Reddy accepted a copy of a resolution passed by a group of weavers in front of a Ganesha idol. A group from Chinna Arepalli village in Dubbaka similarly promised to vote for TRS candidate S Ramalinga Reddy. Telangana Assembly Speaker Madhusudhana Chary was the recipient of a resolution passed by 150 voters in Mulugu Ghanpur mandal in Bhupalapalli. About 70 people took a pledge to vote for Warangal candidate Vinay Bhaskar. In Khanapur constituency, close to 200 voters pledged to back Rekha Naik of the TRS. Even though the number of voters in each group is not very large, the videos of such pledges propagated through Whatsapp and other forms of social media, give an impression of a mass upsurge in favour of the TRS. They make it seem that the elections are a mere formality and that the Opposition is fighting a losing battle. These are mind games being played by the TRS even before the formal campaign has kicked off. This is bound to put pressure on Opposition candidates, once they are announced, to try similar gimmicks among their support groups. In Siddipet, a group of barbers offered to do a haircut and a shave for free till election day for anyone who promised to vote for Harish Rao. One of them was recorded on a mobile camera talking about the decision. But the manner in which another person, not visible on camera, was heard prompting the barber on what to say, only aroused suspicion that it was a set-up. While there is nothing to prove that money exchanged hands to nudge a community to pass a resolution in favour of many of the TRS candidates, the case of Ravinder Reddy, where money is being openly offered, has made this entire exercise look suspect. Privately, the TRS leadership is displeased with the outing of the Ravinder Reddy video, admitting it was wrong on his part to offer money and to be careless about it being recorded on camera. But leaders also point out that people routinely demand cricket kits, construction of a community hall and gym in their localities and expect the candidates to donate money. Bribing voters at election time is not as widespread in Telangana as it is in Tamil Nadu, or even Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to an extent. But this election, in which the stakes are high, promises to be different. This kind of conduct reduces an election to a transaction, making electoral democracy a case of `buy' the people. ""This will be seen as a violation of the model code of conduct which is already in effect,'' says Bhanwarlal, who was Chief Electoral Officer of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh till November 2017. ""Even if money is not given for taking such an oath, the question arises as to why they asked them to take such a pledge. If you say it was done voluntarily, the question arises as to why they would do so, and why all of them are speaking in favour of only one party.'' The Opposition parties have complained to the Election Commission about the resolutions, which they allege are sponsored by the TRS. ""This Telangana government is still a caretaker government; the state is not under Governor's rule. But you find no minister attending to official work. Instead, they are out in their constituencies, organising these pledges,'' says Aditya Reddy of the Telangana Jana Samiti. The TRS denies anyone is being coerced or bribed to take part in these resolutions. ""These resolutions are not binding on anyone. It is the decision of people in panchayats to express solidarity with the TRS so that tomorrow, they can rightfully ask for benefits from the TRS government,'' says Kishore Goud, TRS leader. In the past, there have been cases of villages in Telangana auctioning their votes to the highest bidder well before the panchayat elections. The money would then be used to fund developmental work in the village. ""I would say this is worse,'' says former IAS officer Jayaprakash Narayan and founder of Foundation for Democratic Reforms. ""The EC should penalise such villages, because it puts pressure on other voters in the village to also fall in line. It will browbeat those who are opposed to this mood in favour of a particular candidate.'' But while it is highly unlikely that politicians will pay the price, D Ravinder, a primary school teacher in Karimnagar district has.

Press Trust of India," Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday described the controversial Rafale deal as the ""father of Bofors"" and said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's importance in the country's politics had increased after repeatedly speaking against the deal. In an article in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut said those who accused Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's relatives of receiving kickbacks worth Rs 65 crore in the Bofors deal were in power now. ""Today, they are accused of pocketing Rs 700 crore in the Rafale jet deal. Rafale is the father of Bofors."" Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party over Francois Hollande's reported claims on the deal, the Sena MP wondered if the former French president would be dubbed a supporter of the Congress president or an ""anti-national"". On 21 September, a French media report quoted Hollande as purportedly saying the Indian government proposed Reliance Defence as an offset partner for Rafale maker Dassault Aviation in the Rs 58,000-crore deal and France did not have a choice. ""The question is not that Anil Ambani was given the contract for the fighter jets, but, as against the price of Rs 527 crore for each jet, the deal was done at Rs 1,570 crore during (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi government's tenure. This means middlemen got a commission of about Rs 1,000 crore per jet,"" the Sena leader said. Raut termed it laughable the BJP's allegations that Gandhi's criticism of the deal was akin to ""speaking in the words of Pakistan and helping"" the neighbouring country. ""The same allegations were levelled against the Congress during the Bofors deal (in late 1980s). Was it then not helping Pakistan? Those in power term Bofors a scandal... However, they are not ready to believe Rafale is also a scam."" ""In the country, only Rahul Gandhi was speaking against the Rafale deal, while all other political parties kept mum. Thus, Rahul is now getting more importance in the politics of the nation,"" the Rajya Sabha MP said. Raut was apprehensive that the government would try to bring curtains down on the controversy by shifting the public's attention to issues like Ram temple and Hindu-Muslim. He alleged that a process was on to fool everybody on the deal and the government and BJP spokespersons were having to speak a ""100 lies to hide one lie"". ""Nothing related to security deals are hidden anymore. Thus, there is no point in not disclosing details in the name of (national) security. Defence deals have not been brought under the ambit of the RTI, yet this Rafale came out,"" he added. Led by the Congress, the Opposition parties have been attacking the BJP government over the Rafale deal, alleging it was procuring 36 Rafale jets from France at an exorbitantly high cost. The government has denied the charge, arguing that it was getting the jets cheaper than what the previous UPA dispensation had negotiated. Anil Ambani had contended that the Indian government had no role in Dassault picking up his company as a local partner.

FP Staff,"Ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has proposed Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) as a possible ally in the Congress-NCP grand alliance, to put up a strong front against the BJP. The Congress has reportedly rejected the proposal. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik told about the party's strong reservations towards the inclusion of MNS to put up a strong anti-BJP front. “We feel all parties against the Narendra Modi-led BJP government should be included in the grand alliance. The NCP’s objective is to put up a stronger anti-BJP alliance. In such a situation, we believe every single vote and individual matters,” he said. “The MNS’ support will help make the Opposition’s position strong in urban areas such as Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Pune and Nashik. There are some 25 Assembly seats where the MNS can have a direct impact. With MNS splitting the votes of the saffron parties, our candidates can get an edge and in some seats, our votes can benefit the MNS candidate,”  quoted a senior NCP leader who requested anonymity. The leaders believe the MNS can have an impact in Sewri, Byculla, Mahim, Ghatkopar East, Ghatkopar West, Magathane, Borivali and Mulund seats. Senior state Congress leaders opposed the move as they are worried that the induction of MNS would alienate their North Indian vote bank, reported  . Congress president Sanjay Nirupam rejected the idea, ""MNS stands for everything the Congress opposes. They believe in hooliganism, beat up north Indians and indulge in anti-constitutional activities. We have clarified from the start that there can be no alliance with them and Delhi holds a similar view,”  quoted Nirupam as saying. The MNS, however, has chosen to stay silent. Meanwhile, in a similar bid to create an anti-BJP front for the elections, Swabhimani Sattkar Sanghatana president Raju Shetty is set to meet Prakash Ambedkar, president of Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) on 6 October to formulate a strategy to defeat BJP, according to Congress and NCP leaders in Maharashtra began their  on 11 September aimed at forging a ""grand alliance"" of ""secular"" parties to take on the BJP and the Shiv Sena. The two parties, that ruled Maharashtra for 15 years from 1999, were defeated in the 2014 Assembly elections by the BJP after they parted ways ahead of the polls. Both the Congress and the NCP have already started their election preparations separately. The NCP has covered the state with its ""Halla Bol yatra"", while the Congress launched its mass contact programme from western Maharashtra in September. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the NCP had bagged four seats, while the Congress got only two out of the total 48 seats in Maharashtra.

Indo-Asian News Service," Stepping up the attack on the Congress, BJP on Tuesday said that there was a nexus between Rahul Gandhi's brother in law Robert Vadra and arms dealer and middleman Sanjay Bhandari due to which the Rafale deal with French firm was cancelled in 2012. ""Bhandari, who has close links with Vadra, formed a company named Offset India Solutions (OIS) in 2008 and he formed a joint venture with Rafaut as he tried to enter into an offset clause in the Rafale fighter jets deal through the back door,"" Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra told the media in Delhi. He alleged that the then government mounted pressure on the French firm Dassault Aviation to give works to Bhandari's company. ""But when Dassault verified the infrastructure of OIS, it found that they did not have the required criteria. It also found Bhandari's links with Vadra. So Dassault became adamant and they made it clear that they do not want to enter into any kind of deal with the OIS,"" he said. ""And this was the reason why the Rafale deal was then scrapped after years of negotiations as Vadra was not getting the commission out of the deal,"" he accused. Patra also said that the Congress played with national security and the strength of the Indian Air Force (IAF). ""When the BJP government came to power in 2014, investigations started against Bhandari. And during raids at 18 places in 2016 at the premises of Bhandari a lot of classified documents were recovered,"" he said. He said that Bhandari's company was also blacklisted by the Indian government. Alleging links between Vadra and Bhandari, the BJP leader said that during raids in 2016 and the emails exchanged between the two, Vadra's close associate Manoj Arora and a relative of Bhandari named Sumit Chahdha, also came to the fore. ""In an email it was revealed that Bhandari's relative Chahdha paid Rs 19 crore for a flat in London for Vadra,"" Patra alleged. He also alleged that Bhandari's firm also paid for the air travels of Vadra in 2012. ""The government has acted against Bhandari as per law. And today we are saying that Vadra also would not be spared,"" he said. The BJP leader further alleged that the then Congress government also rejected Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)-developed Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 and went for the Swiss aircraft Pilatus in 2012. ""This deal was given to the Swiss company to bribe the Gandhi family and to pay commission on the deal to the Gandhi family,"" he added.",2018-09-25,"Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Congress,Dassault Aviation,HAL,Hindustan Aeronautics Limited,IAF,IndianAirForce,NewsTracker,Offset India Solutions,Rafale Deal,Rahul Gandhi,Robert Vadra,Sambit Patra,Sanjay Bhandari",BJP claims link between Robert Vadra and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandhari reason behind Rafale deal cancellation,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-claims-link-between-robert-vadra-and-arms-dealer-sanjay-bhandhari-reason-behind-rafale-deal-cancellation-edited-5261591.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The Congress upped the ante on the Narendra Modi government over the Rafale deal on Tuesday, saying the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue showed why the anti-corruption ombudsman Lokpal was not constituted during his tenure. The Congress also asked the prime minister to come out with the truth in the case and bring 'sachhe din' (day of truth) at least, instead of the promised 'achhe din' (good days) that never came. It also said that the ruling party, instead of coming out with the truth in the Rafale deal, was resorting to abuse and mud-slinging and asked Modi whether he was ""(Reliance Defence chief) Ambani's PM or the country's prime minister"". Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is in his Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, said more facts on the Rafale fighter deal  , while telling the youth there that they lost jobs as a related contract went to the Reliance Group rather than the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). ""This is the beginning,"" he told reporters in Amethi, and ""the truth will be before you and you can judge"". Reminding his constituents that a HAL unit was located in Amethi district, he repeated the charge that the Rafale deal's offset contract ""wrongly"" went to Anil Ambani's Reliance group instead of the public sector HAL. ""The youth should understand that employment opportunities have been snatched from HAL and from you all,"" he said. Targeting the prime minister, Rahul said Modi had claimed he wanted to be the country ' ' (watchman). ""But he put Rs 30,000 crore in Ambani's pocket."" ""The money which belonged to the youth and IAF was snatched from them and put in Ambani's pocket,"" he said. Rahul also took to Twitter to say that he understands the pain of jawans, Air Force officers, the families of martyred pilots as well as HAL workers and will work to bring to justice all those who dishonoured and stole from them. He addressed them all on Twitter in his apparent attack against the Narendra Modi government on the issue. Congress leader Randeep Surjewala rejected the BJP's claim that Rahul wanted the Rafale deal to be scrapped to help a firm linked to his brother-in-law Robert Vadra and said the Modi government was responding to the alleged ""scam"" with abuses and mud-slinging. On Monday, the BJP alleged that the Congress president was   and former French president Francois Hollande was part of the ""nexus"" to sabotage the Rafale deal. Responding to the charge, Surjewala said, ""The country has heard the tale of 'Ali Baba aur Chaalis Chor', now it is asking that when will Modi Baba and 'Chaalis Chor' answer,"" Surjewala said in a word play on the folk tale ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves"". ""Are you Ambani's prime minister, or the country's prime minister?"" he also asked. Former union minister Kapil Sibal alleged corruption in the fighter jet deal, saying it has now become clear from the silence of the Modi government and Modi on why it did not constitute the Lokpal during its tenure. ""When we look at these undisputed facts on Rafale scam, we will know why Lokpal was never constituted. Had Lokpal been there, the truth would have come out,"" he told reporters.""If not 'achhe din', at least bring 'sachhe din' now by speaking the truth on the issue,"" he said. ""We only want to hear what the prime minister has to say. He should come out with the facts of the deal,"" he demanded. Narrating the chronology of events from the decision to buy 36 aircraft off-the-shelf from Dassault and the signing of the inter-governmental agreement, the former union minister said it points to a ""conspiracy"". Sibal said neither the foreign ministry, defence minister, nor Dassault knew what the prime minister will be doing in France during his visit in April 2015. On 10 April, 2015, the prime minister announced to buy 36 Rafale aircraft off-the-shelf and this is undisputed fact, he said. ""Who knew that Prime Minister Modi would change the deal? Who knew what Modi said to Hollande. Only Hollande and Modi knew what transpired during their meeting...the prime minister should say what happened at the meeting. We want him to come out with the facts on the Rafale deal,"" he said. Sibal alleged that ""this is corruption that India has never seen"" and said no prime minister has ever gone to another country and signed a defence deal. ""This is contrary to the democratic way of functioning. You don't buy armaments like this,"" he said. On 24 August, 2016, he said, Cabinet committee on Security (CCS) clearance was taken, which should have been taken before hand, after the deal was finalised on 10 April, 2015 and on 23 September, 2016 an inter-governmental agreement was signed. The same day the offset agreement was also signed. On 3 October, 2016, Reliance Aerostructure and Dassault formed a joint venture in which Reliance had a share of 51 percent and Dassault would have 49 percent, he claimed. ""What was the benefit of sidelining HAL? Or who benefitted from it?"" he asked. The Congress leader said, ""the prime minister thinks that he is entitled to do what he likes because he owns 1.3 billion people and he can do what he wants to do with them.

Press Trust of India," Former Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar claimed even Lord Ram would have to spend money to get elected in the current political situation. He was addressing a youth convention of the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM), which he mentors in Panaji, on Wednesday. ""During elections, politicians are busy luring two kinds of people, the youth and women, whom they find gullible, by offering them cash or gifts,"" he said. ""Due to rampant use of money power during elections, in the current situation, even Shri Ram will not get elected if he doesn't spend money."" He had floated the GSM on the eve of the 2017 Goa Assembly elections after he fell out with BJP leader Manohar Parrikar over the issue of medium of instruction in school education. He had accused the BJP of ""losing morality and indulging in the same practices like other parties in the country"". Velingkar also attacked the chief minister over his decision to drop two ailing ministers from the state Cabinet. ""Parrikar dropped two ministers from the Cabinet because they are sick, but he himself remains stuck to his position despite being critically ill,"" he said.

Suhit K Sen,"Wednesday’s statewide bandh in West Bengal sponsored by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was billed as a crucial showdown. It was staged to protest police firing at a crowd composed largely of school students in Uttar Dinajpur district in North Bengal. Two young men, one an alumnus of the school that was at the epicentre of the trouble, were killed. The sponsors of the bandh announced on Saturday had said that they did not support shutdowns in general but had been forced to call one because of the breakdown of governance structures in the state. They had also said they would not force people to observe it, but the ‘people’ would support their call spontaneously. The ruling Trinamool Congress, on the other hand, had geared up to neutralise the bandh on an industrial scale. The entire state public transport fleet was to be pressed into service, the Metro would run; all government employees had been told they had to attend office; schools and colleges were t0 remain open; education minister Partha Chatterjee had also cautioned private schools against observing a holiday or postponing scheduled examinations; and the administration had let it be known that police deployment would be at maximal levels to assure people they could keep establishments open or otherwise go about their normal work. In the event, the bandh was partially successful, if that’s the right word in this context. There were a couple of violent incidents in Kolkata: a bus was set ablaze by a few people trying to enforce the bandh, injuring a couple of people. Elsewhere in the state, vehicles were vandalised, including a couple of police cars. There were clashes between those trying to enforce the bandh and those bent on keeping normal life moving. On the whole, educational institutions, government offices and commercial establishments (including banks) remained open and attendance was on the high side. But a lot of people in private employment and citizen, in general, chose not to brave the possibility of being caught in the crossfire and did not venture out. Both human and vehicular traffic was light in Kolkata and elsewhere. The BJP can draw heart from the fact that their cadres proved a match for the administration. Mobilisation and organisation seemed to have been both smart and on a scale not anticipated, though mostly in areas where the party had gained ground at the time of the panchayat elections. The Trinamool Congress will have to factor in the growing assertiveness and aggression of the BJP when it draws up its political and mobilisational blueprints. A backlash cannot be ruled out in the near future, with the ruling party drawing up plans to capture 42 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections, which are a few months away. As the two sides confront each other, questions will point backwards at the genesis of the troubles. It started last Thursday with a seemingly run-of-the-mill protest meeting outside a school in Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur, over the appointment of three teachers. Claims and counter-claims make it difficult to ascertain the whole truth, but it does appear that while the students of Daribhit High School wanted teachers for core disciplines, two Urdu teachers and one Sanskrit teacher were given appointments. The local people are fairly clear that the police opened fire on the protestors, but the police say they did not. The superintendent of police of the district says tear-gas shells were exploded and rubber bullets fired. The families of the victims and the BJP want a CBI probe. The administration has ordered its own probe and has not really taken notice of this demand. The Trinamool Congress alleges that the BJP and Daribhit High School were responsible for instigating the violence. From Italy, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that people were brought in from outside the state—Islampur is practically on the border with Bihar—to foment violence. The claim has not been substantiated. But even if that were the case, it does not absolve the ruling party or the district administration. The district administration should have been alive to the problem, which had been brewing for some time. In that sense, it was not just a spontaneous outburst. If there had been an abnormal movement of outsiders into the area, it should have been all the more prepared for an eventuality. It wasn’t. Nor did the education monitor the developing situation, as it ought to have been doing. Had it done so, it could have talked to the students and arrived at some kind of understanding. Second, and perhaps more important, is a political question. The Trinamool Congress, as a party and as the incumbent in power, should know that the BJP has emerged as the biggest opposition force in Bengal, will follow its sectarian agenda by trying to polarise Bengal. And they will focus on areas most receptive to its ideology. The ruling party must have a political strategy to counter the BJP agenda. It must, therefore, mobilise from an avowedly ‘secular’ vantage. It’s very possible because Bengal’s post-independence history shows that sectarian politics has never had many buyers in the state.",2018-09-27,"Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,Daribhit High School,Mamata Banerjee,Partha Chatterjee,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,States,Trinamool Congress,West Bengal",West Bengal bandh: Trinamool Congress needs to re-examine its strategy as BJP fast emerges as strong opponent in state,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/west-bengal-bandh-trinamool-congress-needs-to-re-examine-its-strategy-as-bjp-fast-emerges-as-strong-opponent-in-state-5273391.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and said that it empowers the marginalised sections of the society. The Congress party welcomed the verdict of the apex court calling it a victory of UPA government's policies, as the concept of Aadhaar was introduced during its regime. Senior advocate and Congress leader Kapil Sibal, however, said that if the BJP government won't bring the Aadhaar Bill to Rajya Sabha, Congress will again approach the Supreme Court. “One important part of judgment to be noted is — if in the future a Lok Sabha speaker declares a bill as Money Bill, then the court can review this and revert. We will approach a seven-judge bench to consider this verdict again as this is clearly not a Money Bill,” said Sibal. ""The Congress has been demanding that the Aadhaar Enabling Act should have come to Rajya Sabha since it was not a money bill…had it been discussed in the Rajya Sabha, it wouldn’t have reached the Supreme Court, he said. On asked if it is a setback for the Opposition, since the majority of judges ruled in favour of Aadhaar, Sibal said, ""No, it is not a setback as striking down the Act would have deprived the marginalised sections. But we agree with Justice Chandrachud that it is a fraud on the Constitution."" Sibal also hailed the striking down of  of the Aadhaar Act, stating that this will put an end to mass surveillance. ""By striking down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act, Supreme Court firmly put an end to the mass surveillance exercise being carried out under the guise of Aadhar by the Central Government and the grotesque distortion of an idea conceived by the UPA,"" said Sibal. He also stated that it was not unconstitutional, but against democracy. The Supreme Court reading down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act means that an Aadhaar card is no long longer a proof of identity and cannot be demanded for that purpose. It stipulated that the State, a body corporate or person can request for Aadhaar, if required by law, which gave legislative backing to mobile companies and other private service providers to seek customers’ Aadhaar card for identification purposes. However, Sabil pointed out other grey areas in the verdict.  ""Like a lot of people who work with their hands, when they go for fingerprint identification, they are not able to register. What happens to their right?"" he asked. He questioned the government, asking that if the data that has been collected is illegal, why did the government allow it in the first place. ""The Supreme Court has said that all the data that has been collected so far is illegal. Why did this government allow such illegal work?"" He also blamed the BJP government for being arrogant and allowing crores of people's biodata to land in private hands. ""Had the government not been arrogant and allowed the democratic process to work, none of this would have happened. The result of all this is that crores of people's biodata is now in private hands. This is an immeasurable harm done to the polity and democracy in the country,"" he said. Continuing his onslaught against the Centre, Sibal said that the passage of the Aadhaar Enabling Act violates both the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Right to Privacy and is thus, a gross abuse of the money bill route. The Congress had earlier termed the striking down of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act as a ""slap on the face of BJP"". ""We welcome the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act. Private entities are no longer allowed to use Aadhaar for verification purposes,"" the Congress said on   minutes after the verdict. The majority verdict by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A K Sikri and A M Khanwilkar declared the Centre's flagship Aadhaar scheme constitutionally valid but struck down some of its provisions, including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.

Ajay Singh,"*** In the post emergency phase, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was accused of being run by largely Brahmins and upper castes; that it is significantly biased against backward and Scheduled Castes.This allegation was liberally levelled largely by the socialists who found the Sangh steadfastly refusing to play second fiddle to their politics. Though the issue of dual-membership (being part of the Janata Party while continuing their allegiance to the RSS) emanated, to a great extent, from the inability of a group of socialist leaders' to make the RSS amenable to their designs, RSS chief Balasahab Deoras hit back with facts. He released a list of RSS senior leaders who belonged to various caste groups across the country while pointing out that socialist formations, in fact, were led largely by Brahmin leaders. In the 1970s, the RSS had drafted a large number of socially and economically marginalised sections into its fold. The emergence of many OBC leaders as icons of the Hindutva was not an overnight development. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emergence as the tallest Hindutva leader coming from backward class is not a freak accident. It is consistent with the history of the RSS and its efforts to forge a Hindutva force subsuming all castes. It will be naïve to drive a caste wedge within the Sangh Parivar on the basis of Dalits versus upper castes or OBCs. Far from creating internal frictions, the Sangh will emerge much stronger should there be a Dalit Hindutva icon like Modi. Given the radical transformation within the Sangh Parivar’s cadre base, such a probability is not far fetched. The understanding about the RSS and its various constituents is marked by serious intellectual deficit. The saffron family is seen in a typical binary which either valorises or vilifies it. It is not that there were no serious studies on the RSS and its constituents, it is just that the right messages have not been derived from the same. Take for example, the brilliant study of the RSS in 1951 by American scholar JA Curran Jr. Curran presciently observed, “It is popularly believed that the Sangh will, in the event of gaining power, automatically support vested interests — capitalistS, landlords and others. The author considers that, while a number of RSS sympathisers and supporters, particularly those in the group just described, look to the Sangh as potential guardian of their specific interests, there is no pronounced enthusiasm among most swayamsevaks for any such role. Despite the lack of formal economic programme, there is a strong vein in the Sangh ranks of what might be called Hindu socialism."" This study was carried out much before the RSS’s political arm — the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), which later became the BJP — was born. Subsequent events proved Curran’s prognosis about the Sangh’s politics right. For instance, the BJS pitched not only for the abolition   and the privy purse much against the general impression that the party would side with the liberal and open economy. It suffered electoral setbacks for this stance. In terms of economic agenda, the Swatantra Party (formed by C Rajagopalachari in 1959) offered a more cogent response to the Congress than the RSS-BJS combine. Deendayal Upadhyay’s ""integral humanism"" was considered a muddled up response to the Congress' gradual drift towards socialism. Till 1967 when the BJS forged an alliance with the socialists, the Swatantra Party and hardliners like the Hindu Mahasabha and the Ram Rajya Parishad, it kept on changing its goalposts and adapted itself to changing circumstances. Yet, the underlying theme of all these efforts was a larger cause of consolidation of the Hindu society. This ideal ran contrary to the dominant Nehruvian political narrative of those times, secularism earning the RSS-BJS the ""communal"" tag. But what is significant is the refusal of the Sangh Parivar to be guided by a doctrinaire approach to Hindutva which was akin to adhering to Brahminism. This flexibility was retained only to accommodate various social groups within the Hindus that follow rituals different — and sometimes even contradictory — from each other. In this context, the RSS’ evolution as an ideological mentor to the BJP is quite instructive and without precedent in the history of building political parties. The manner in which the RSS allowed the BJS to merge with the Janata Party in the post-emergency phase was indicative of the RSS’ confidence over its swayamsevaks. When Deoras wrote a letter saying swayamsevaks were free to follow their discretion in politics, he faced criticism. Deoras was unfazed. He said that he was quite confident of his volunteers who would not be guided by a mere ""letter"". And as it happened, when the socialist groups within the Janata Parivar pressed too hard for BJS leaders to give up their allegiance to the RSS, all BJS leaders, barring a few, came out of the Janata Party and floated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a seamless transition from the BJS. The BJP under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee followed ""Gandhian socialism"" which incorporated features of egalitarianism in sync with the dominant political narrative. What is particularly significant in the evolution of the RSS-BJP is the fact that the leadership of both the organisations was on the same page in using politics as an instrument to empower social underdogs, particularly those belonging to the most backward classes/scheduled castes/scheduled tribes. In the Sangh Parivar’s concept of Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation), the inclusion of the marginalised sections of the Hindu society is an essential component of the nation-building. The Modi government’s decision to overturn the Supreme Court order that diluted the Schedule Caste and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act must be seen as a sequel to this project. Without doubt such a project often comes in conflict with with the party’s substantial upper caste support base. But it would be naïve to undermine the capacity of the Sangh Parivar to navigate through these social land mines.",2018-09-27,"Backward Caste,Backward Castes,Balasahab Deoras,Bharatiya Jana Sangh,BJP,C Rajagopalachari,Communalism,Congress,Dalit,Gandhian Socialism,Hindu,Hindutva,InMyOpinion,Janata Party,Jawaharlal Nehru,Mahatma Gandhi,Mohan Bhagwat,Mulsim,Muslims,Narendra Modi,Narendra Modi And The RSS,Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh,RSS,Scheduled Caste,Socialism,Swatantra Paty,Upper Caste","Narendra Modi and RSS, Part 2: Rise of a backward caste as PM is highpoint of Sangh's Hindutva project",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modi-and-rss-part-2-rise-of-a-backward-caste-as-pm-is-highpoint-of-sanghs-hindutva-project-not-a-freak-accident-5270741.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sameer Yasir,"Firstpost *** At Tanghar-Rajpora, some 40 kilometres from Srinagar, the half-burnt Panchayat building has turned into a public spectacle. Built some six years ago, villagers arrived in droves in the courtyard of the building to check its charred doors and windows as streaks of smoke rose in the air. “It was built in 2012,” Mohammad Ramzan, a former  , said, as he peeped into a room through a half-burnt window to assess the magnitude of devastation caused by the fire. The single-storied white and red-coloured building, situated in a desolate part of the village, was locked when the arsonists arrived on Tuesday night. No one knows who it was! Inside the building, a half burnt steel locker, few wooden chairs and some tables have turned into charcoal. There was not much in its four rooms. Those who put it on fire had emptied it first. It was one among nearly dozen Panchayat buildings set on fire by arsonists after the announcement of Urban Local Body and Panchayat polls this month. “The message of the arsonists is clear: No matter what, no one should take part in the upcoming polls,” said Showkat Hamid, a resident of Nazneenpora village in Shopian district, where unidentified people set a panchayat office ablaze on Tuesday. “The damage was minimum,” Showkat said, “but the message was clear.” On the same day, another attempt was made in Nagbal village of Tral and one more in Drabgam area of Pulwama district. Showkat, a post graduate in Philosophy from the University of Kashmir, said the majority of people see these buildings as the only symbol of the government’s presence in the locality, so they end up becoming the first targets. “People want to send a message to those who want to be part of this exercise: today it is a panchayat office, tomorrow it can be your home,” he said. The upcoming elections are seen as a “forced decision” by New Delhi to portray that the situation is under control in Kashmir. But after the two major regional parties of the state — Peoples Democratic Party and National Conference — decided to boycott the elections, the perception about the process has changed. The state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, reiterated on Wednesday that it was determined to contest the polls in every ward of Kashmir. The party believes that those who are boycotting the elections are doing “great injustice” with the people of Kashmir. “It was the demand of general public that these elections should be conducted,” BJP state president Ravinder Raina said. But people in villages have expressed apprehension about the polls with militant groups threatening to carry out acid attacks. The boycott by the regional players has not helped New Delhi, so much so that the state’s information department and chief electoral officer have not revealed the names of the people who have submitted forms for the urban local body polls, which are going to be held in first phase of the local polls. There are close to 5,000   office in almost every zone of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and close to five hundred places are without it because the government failed to procure the land, said Sheetal Nanda, secretary, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, in Jammu and Kashmir. “None of them have been substantially damaged, apart from Budgam, but there is concern over their safety,"" she said in Srinagar. But on the ground, the government’s claim on the numbers seems to be a far cry from the reality. There have more than a dozen attempts by unknown people to set the buildings on fire that were hardly reported and the state government has shut down mobile internet in two volatile districts of Pulwama and Shopian in south Kashmir as a “firefighting measure”. In the ongoing, every day turmoil in the embattled Valley, the news about the arsonists’ rage is often underplayed, as both the state and Central governments have refused to delay the elections, arguing the state is losing huge amount of funds that are needed for development in villages. “It is just impossible to take development forward if we still delay the elections. It means a loss of Rs 4,335 crores if the the elections are delayed,” said Jammu and Kashmir’s chief secretary, BVR Subrahmanyam. But these financial considerations mean nothing for people on the ground. Ghulam Rasool Bhat was at his home when flames started billowing out of the panchayat office in Seer Jagir area of Tral. Bhat lives more then 500 meters from the the building but he did not dare to come out. ""We held two meeting there to discuss the plan for the development of the area when I was a sarpanch. But those ideas never materialised because of lack of funds,” Bhat, who is in his late 60s, said, while a group of labourers harvested his paddy field. ""It was a nice building on which a lot of money was spent. Now it's gone,” he added. “Now I would never be part of it because I am not fighting again, so I don’t even think about it,” said Bhat.",2018-10-04,"BJP,Boycott,Gram Panchayat Office,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Local Body Polls,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayati Raj Polls,Kashmir,National Conference,New Delhi,NewsTracker,Panchayat,Panchayati Raj,PDP,Pulwama,Ravinder Raina,Seer Jagir,Sheetal Nanda,Shopian,South Kashmir,Tral","Jammu and Kashmir local body polls, Part IV: Miscreants set panchayat offices on fire to 'warn' contestants, voters",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-local-body-polls-part-iv-miscreants-set-panchayat-offices-on-fire-to-warn-contestants-5271001.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday claimed that Sardar Patel's mega statue in Gujarat, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was being built by China, evoking stinging reactions from the BJP and the Gujarat government. The 182-meter statue, being built at Sadhu Bet in Narmada district and tipped to be the world's tallest statue, is slated to be inaugurated by Modi on the icon's birth anniversary on 31 October. Named as the 'Statue of Unity', the monument is a pet project of Modi who had laid the foundation stone for it in October 2013, when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. ""The Prime Minister used to say that we will install the statue of Sardar Patel in Gujarat. It is unfortunate that the iron man's statue will be inscribed with 'Made-in-China' as it is being made by China,"" Gandhi said at a rally in Satna in Madhya Pradesh. ""It is a disrespect to the great nationalist, freedom fighter and the man behind the development of the nation,"" the Congress leader added. Gujarat Chief minister Vijay Rupani accused Gandhi of ""lying shamelessly"" while asserting that the statue was made in India. Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel went further by saying that Gandhi himself was ""Made-in-Italy"". ""Rahul Gandhi has Italian blood. He is made in Italy. He is a foreigner. But we do not rake up this issue. But, when he is trying to devalue the tallest statue being built here, he should see that he also has Italian blood,"" Patel said in Ahmedabad. ""Though he is having Italian blood he is Congress president. Now it is for the Congress to decide if they want to make a person with mixed blood... having Italian blood as their president or those who have pure blood,"" Patel said. He said the entire country was feeling proud that the ""world's tallest statue"" is being built here and asked ""why is Rahul Gandhi not feeling proud about it?"" The Gujarat government went on to clarify that after the international tenders were floated for erecting the tallest statue of the world of the first home minister of the country Vallabhbhai Patel, Indian company Larson and Tubro (L&T) bagged the contract. It said that 95 percent making and raw materials of the statue are Indian, while other five per cent parts which were not available in the country were imported from China. Patel said that, L&T being lowest bidder had bagged the contract for building of the statue. ""Only some bronze material, for which expertise were not available in India has been imported by the company from China,"" he added. Senior BJP leader and union minister Uma Bharti said, ""The iron for making Sardar Patel's statue was collected from different villages of the country.

Indo-Asian News Service," In what could apply to Telangana now, the Election Commission on Thursday said the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) would come into effect immediately after premature dissolution of a state Legislative Assembly with a caretaker government deprived of all powers to make policy decisions. ""The commission has considered the matter of application of the Model Code of Conduct in the cases of premature dissolution of a Legislative Assembly, where a caretaker government has been asked to carry on the administration of that state or Union Territory for the purposes of free, fair, transparent and robust electoral process. ""On careful consideration of the matter, keeping the observation of Supreme Court in the SR Bommai and Others versus Union of India and Others (1994), that the caretaker government should merely carry on the day-to-day governance and desist from making any major policy situation decision in view,"" the poll panel said in an order. The direction has implications for Telangana, where the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) government led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao is continuing as a caretaker government after it dissolved the state assembly around nine months in advance. Accepting the decision, the state governor had dissolved the Assembly and asked the chief minister to continue in office till the elections. The EC said that in such cases, the provisions of Part-VII of the Model Code of Conduct shall come into operation ""with immediate effect"" in the state concerned and will continue to be in force till the completion of the elections to constitute the new Legislative Assembly. The poll panel in its order said the provisions of the Part-VII of Model Code of Conduct would apply on the caretaker state government as well as on the central government ""in so far as matters relating to that state are concerned"". ""Consequently, neither the caretaker state government nor the central government shall announce any new schemes, projects, etc in respect of that state or undertake any of the activities prohibited under the aforesaid Part-VII of the Model Code of Conduct,"" the EC said.

Debobrat Ghose,"Manvendra Singh, son of BJP stalwart Jaswant Singh, and legislator from Sheo Assembly segment in Barmer, Rajasthan, broke his four-decade-old association with the BJP last week. At a swabhiman rally at Pachpadra in Barmer on 22 September, he made his displeasure with the current leadership of the party, both at the state level and the Centre, clear. Speaking to  , he drew a bleak picture of the BJP's prospects in the upcoming Assembly election in Rajasthan. He also outlined his future course of action, saying a referendum among his supporters would decide his next move, including whether he would join the Congress. It wasn’t easy for me to break the strong bond I had with BJP. I had to severe four-decade old ties with the party and finally quit. It was a culmination of several incidents over the years — from 2014 till now when I quit. First, the way my father had been ill-treated by the party leadership from 2014. He was denied Lok Sabha ticket despite the fact that he was a four-time Lok Sabha MP (and five-time Rajya Sabha member). Despite dedicating his entire life to the party, he was sidelined in a most derogatory manner. Second, I wasn’t given Lok Sabha ticket from Barmer. Third, my supporters and I have been continuously targeted and hounded by the state BJP. My house (in Barmer) was surrounded by a section of BJP workers and ruckus was created. Fourth, the apathy of state BJP under Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje towards me, and even towards my father. Yes, I had told the central leadership but to no effect. It wasn’t redressed. BJP president Amit Shah can comment on this better. I’m not the right person. My joining the Congress party is a speculation right now. I have sought a referendum and have asked views of my supporters and voters of my constituency. I will finally go by their decision. There has been no discussion with Congress on this front. However, I know both of them well and they know me too. Both Sachin and I had been Parliament colleagues. No, I’m not interested in the Assembly election. My choice has always been to make it to the Lok Sabha. I’m open to contesting 2019 Lok Sabha election. BJP has no chance of winning in Rajasthan this time. There are numerous reasons to feel so. People had showed a lot of confidence in the leadership of Vasundhara Raje and voted BJP to power with absolute majority. She made tall promises to voters, but failed to deliver. Then there are issues like rise in corruption, poor governance and leadership, social fragmentation, rise in cases of lynching and communal riots, etc. Amid all these, the silence of Raje has made the common man in the state frustrated. This is going to have a cascading effect on the party in Rajasthan. Congress will certainly do well, because people are looking for a change. There is frustration among various sections of the society. BJP will do badly in the state in 2019. I can’t comment much about BJP’s performance at an all-India level in 2019.

Marcus Dam," that the hills of Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts, emerging from a lock-down of more than a hundred days, began the long trudge up and down the slippery slopes to a normality that now settled down well, the rhythm of life restored after a phase of protracted political turbulence. Yet, like the last of the monsoon clouds looming over the region, there hang questions over the principle of local governance. And there is more. What does not elude the eye – or, for that matter, the collective memory – is that even after a year the assurance by the Centre of tripartite talks involving the sides concerned to discuss all relevant issues that had precipitated the 104-day June-September 2017 strike is yet to materialise. It was a commitment then made by Union home minister Rajnath Singh of setting the table for discussions within a fortnight which had prompted the sponsors of the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland state to call off the stir. The fate of the promised meeting is still up in the air. In the intervening months the statehood demand has been stripped off the local political discourse, though it still appears to cause a certain level of unease within the ruling political dispensation comprising a leadership which once swore by it. And while it remains to be the elephant in the room, the issue consigned to deep freeze, there has emerged yet another question confronting the authorities – that revolving around whether or not there is some sort of a democratic-deficit in governance. For a region that for more than three decades has been invested with a semi-autonomous governing apparatus, the fact that elections to the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), due for more than a year, have not yet been held and that the Board of Administrators (BOA) of the body, propped up to the seat of power by Mamata Banerjee’s government this month last year, had only recently had its tenure extended by a further six months, only accentuates this perceived deficit. Such a situation has led sections within the local political class to squirm. Only last week, BOA chairman, Binay Tamang, well aware of the criticism emanating from beyond the circles of his political detractors had, for the first time, come out in the open last week claiming that he  . There were also numerous comments in social media regarding the extension, he reportedly admitted. After all, the nominated setup is yet to be endorsed through a public mandate. What is clearly at stake here is the very legitimacy of the BOA as an entity representative of the people. It lacks the agency that an elected body enjoys. Interestingly, Tamang’s remarks were followed up with support to his proposal by the core committee of that faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) which he leads and which would like to cash in while the going is good on what is being perceived its growing popularity. The ball is now in Banerjee’s court. These developments should be viewed in the context of the power struggle between Tamang and fugitive leader Bimal Gurung within the GJM which continues to remain the dominant political force in the hills. Gurung, even in absentia, seeks to make his presence felt through the occasional audio clip and statement issued from his hide-out which could be more than one, and who cites intelligence sources to claim that he still enjoys 70 percent of hoi polloi’s support. And there is the faction led by Tamang to which much of the party’s erstwhile leadership owes allegiance and which is anxious to prove not merely its counterclaim of being the true face of the party in any future electoral contest but also to discount criticism that it owes its ascendancy to the very state administration which was the GJM’s target in the statehood campaign. Behind this tussle in which the odds are presently stacked heavily against Gurung is the proxy confrontation that rages between the BJP and forces arrayed behind Banerjee that is bound to intensify in the run-up to next year’s Lok Sabha polls. New power centres in the form of development boards for different castes and tribes and committees to work in tandem with the GTA have been set up. But these too, it can be argued, lack agency in the wider public sphere.  They all owe their existence to Banerjee who, after a lapse of eight months, has resumed her occasional visits to the hills – meticulously choreographed events designed to demonstrate that she has the entire local political leadership sans Gurung loyalists on board. Yet, in the first anniversary of the watershed moment that re-painted quite dramatically the political landscape of the region, there persists a sense of bewilderment over how Gurung, bent on staging a comeback, has successfully eluded the law all these months. This despite the raft of charges against him including those under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and  . Is it because of the patronage of the BJP which might need his support to retain the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat for the third successive term in the polls next year? Or is it that the state administration is quite content with the current status quo, conscious that any move to apprehend him would make a martyr of him and consequently upset the applecart. There shall no more be strikes, Tamang has assured. Calm has certainly returned to the hills which brace for the coming tourist season.

Sanjay Singh,"Rahul Gandhi, in an interesting take on the  . thanked the apex court “for supporting the Congress vision."" The Congress president claimed that “for the BJP, Aadhaar is a tool of oppression and surveillance”. He, however, conveniently forgot that Jairam Ramesh, a former minister during the UPA regime and a Rajya Sabha MP from the Congress, had petitioned the Supreme Court challenging the passage of the Aadhaar legislation as a Money Bill, and sought that the legislation be struck down. Kapil Sibal, another UPA-era minister, represented Ramesh in court. P Chidambaram, yet another former minister and Rajya Sabha MP, argued against the Aadhaar law in his capacity as a senior advocate. The Congress was the original author of Aadhaar. However, after having lost power, the party put in all its might to argue before the Supreme Court that the law brought in by the Narendra Modi government should be declared invalid. It should instead have claimed credit for having done pioneering work on this front. Outside court too, the party carried out all kinds of campaigns to portray the law as a draconian one, on the lines of what Rahul tweeted on Wednesday — The Supreme Court, in a 4:1 verdict, declared the law as constitutionally valid, and upheld the passage of the Aadhaar legislation as a Money Bill. This judgment is a huge embarrassment for the Congress and a big victory for the Narendra Modi-led government. While the apex court put in place some riders, struck down some sections and clarified where Aadhaar was required and where it was not, it declared the law as a valid one. This gives cause to cheer for the Union government. The Aadhaar Act will continue to be the law of the land, albeit without provisions which required the number to be linked with mobile numbers, bank accounts, etc. The Supreme Court has upheld the Lok Sabha's decision to table the legislation as a Money Bill, and has retained provisions mandating it for welfare measures, and provisions for linking it to PAN. Thus, the Supreme Court has stressed on transparency in the system and last-mile delivery. The Congress president should have cared to   before commenting on it. The apex court has effectively answered criticism about Aadhaar being a ""tool of oppression and surveillance."" With respect to the latter, the court said, ""The architecture of Aadhaar as well as the provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not tend to create a surveillance state. This is ensured by the manner in which the Aadhaar project operates.” With respect to the former, the majority verdict held, ""In a welfare State, where measures are taken to ameliorate the sufferings of the downtrodden, the aim of the Act is to ensure that these benefits actually reach the populace for whom they are meant. This is naturally a legitimate State aim….Enrolment in Aadhaar of the unprivileged and marginalised section of the society, in order to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of the Government, actually amounts to empowering these persons. On the one hand, it gives such individuals their unique identity and, on the other hand, it also enables such individuals to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of the Government which are floated as socio-economic welfare measures to uplift such classes. In that sense, the scheme ensures dignity to such individuals. This facet of dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged.” Other senior Congress leaders too should have gone through the judgment before calling it a   of the BJP. The Congress lost on both counts – the popular narrative and the legal battle. Congress leaders had spoken at length on privacy concerns pertaining to Aadhaar.  However, Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad effectively rebutted their arguments. The Supreme Court is interpreted to have taken a stand contrary to that of the Centre through its ruling on linking of bank accounts with Aadhaar. However, it is mandatory to have a PAN to open a bank account, and it also remains mandatory to link PAN with Aadhaar. Therefore, the authorities can always check the veracity of an account holder if need be. The court observed that Aadhaar cannot be duplicated, unlike PAN. The linking of Aadhaar and PAN has a huge bearing on benami property and several other things. By now, banks have already collected the Aadhaar numbers of almost all their customers. The ruling is silent on what banks are supposed to do with that database. On Wednesday, finance minister Arun Jaitley suggested that the government could bring in a law on linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers. The ferocity with which the Congress opposed the existing Aadhaar legislation gives rise to the question as to why it wanted the law to be struck down. It is not clear why the party was fine with Aadhaar as a unique identification, but not as a document to be linked with various aspects of the economic lives of people. It is indisputable that Aadhaar was a big step forward in introducing probity and transparency in the system, particularly in last-mile delivery to the needy. It eliminated the role of a vast mass of middlemen and minimised corruption. The Congress' position also gives rise to the question as to whether the party is afraid that the Modi government's welfare measures — including subsidies, pensions, scholarships and wages for MNREGA workers — will reach the intended beneficiaries on time, and in full measure. If this happens, it would make crores of people from the weaker sections of society sympathetic to Modi and the BJP.",2018-09-27,"Aadhaar,Aadhaar Act,Arun Jaitley,Congress,InMyOpinion,Jairam Ramesh,Narendra Modi,P.

Press Trust of India," Posters surfaced in Patna on Wednesday depicting Congress president Rahul Gandhi and leaders of the party's Bihar unit as representatives of their respective caste groups. The BJP criticised the Congress over the development. The posters, wherein Gandhi and the AICC in-charge for the state Shaktisinh Gohil were thanked for constituting a new state Congress Committee and ""setting an example of social harmony"" therein, were put up at a number of places in the city. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee was revamped last week with the appointment of new office-bearers. While Rahul Gandhi and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Madan Mohan Jha were described as representing ""Brahmin community"", Gohil's image was labelled ""Rajput samuday"" (community). Images of campaign committee chairman and Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Congress Legislature Party leader Sadanand Singh were, similarly, labelled "" "" and "" "", respectively. The posters also had images of a few other prominent party leaders, with their respective caste groups mentioned thereon. While Congress leaders remained tight-lipped about the posters, BJP state spokesman Nikhil Anand urged the Election Commission to ""take note of the brazen attempt at playing the caste card ahead of the Lok Sabha polls"". ""In sheer desperation, the Congress has been resorting to gimmicks like proclaiming Rahul Gandhi as one who wears the sacred thread, worships Lord Shiva and goes to Kailash Mansarovar on pilgrimage.

Sharing a screenshot of the Patna Sahib MP's remarks quoted in the media in Patna a day ago that there have been irregularities in the Rafale deal and that the Centre should seek ""apology"" from the people of the country, BJP Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha asked him to first make his position clear. ""You should first decide where you stand. With Modi or against Modi. The people of the country will settle the account accordingly,"" RK Sinha said on his Facebook page. Shatrughan Sinha's comment came close on the heels of relentless attacks on the Modi government, through his Twitter handle, in the aftermath of media reports, quoting former French president Francois Hollande that Reliance Defence was selected as the offset partner by Dassault under pressure from Indian government. His Twitter handle is replete with retweets of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, who have come up with fierce criticism of the Modi government on the issue. In his tweets, Shatrughan Sinha has called the controversy surrounding the Rafale deal a serious issue and called for the need for the government to come clean. RK Sinha also said Shatrughan Sinha has been, these days, singing the same tune as Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Prasad by going to the extent of advising the prime minister to speak the truth. RK Sinha's attack on Shatrughan Sinha seems to have political significance. It is widely believed that in the event of the actor-turned-politician not being considered for a third consecutive run in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, RK Sinha or a member of his family could be considered for Patna Sahib seat. The 'Bihari babu' has, nevertheless, been putting up a brave front and maintaining that he would be contesting from the same seat even if not given a ticket by the BJP with the cryptic remark situation may be different, location will be the same Patna Sahib. The actor-turned-politician has been in a sulk for quite some time with sources in the party claiming that he has been upset over not getting a ministerial berth in the current dispensation though he was a member of the Union council of ministers in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Party sources also claim that he had grown bitter aftebeing ignored by the party leadership during 2015 Bihar Assembly poll, wherein the saffron party did not perform well. The actor-turned-politician has, in the recent past, been calling the party a one man show two man army an obvious barb aimed at the Prime Minister besides party chief Amit Shah. He has also been showering praises on opposition leaders like West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and DMK chief MK Stalin besides Lalu, Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi.

Press Trust of India," Rahul Gandhi is involved in a ""conspiracy, internationally"" and former French president Francois Hollande is part of the ""nexus"" to sabotage the Rafale deal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged Monday, claiming that the Congress chief wants it scrapped to help a firm linked to his brother-in-law Robert Vadra. BJP leader and Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat dragged the Gandhi family into the intensifying political row over the fighter aircraft deal, alleging that the UPA government had called off the multi-billion dollar deal after a private company linked to Vadra was not chosen as a broker. At a press conference, he named a private firm and claimed its owner had been working with Vadra. These allegations have been denied by Vadra. He also hinted at Pakistan's role in the conspiracy, saying one of its leaders, former interior minister Rehman Malik, has even tweeted that Rahul will be the next Indian prime minister. Referring to Hollande's reported comments that the Indian government had proposed Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as a partner for Dassault Aviation for the Rafale deal, he said, ""How Rahul Gandhi and he are linked as a part of nexus, and are trying to sabotage the deal needs to be understood."" There is a conspiracy to get the deal scrapped, defame the country and lower the morale of Indian Air Force, Shekhawat alleged. Rahul is doing a ""conspiracy, internationally"", he alleged. Separately, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about an ""international dimension"" to  Rahul's attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the deal, and told reporters that Hollande's comments were not a coincidence. Hollande had reported to have said last week that France had no say in an Anil Ambani-led company being chosen as an offset partner by Dassault, which manufactures Rafale, and India had proposed its name. He later clarified that he was not aware if India had put any pressure on France. In a no-holds-barred attack on the Congress, Shekhawat accused it of compromising national interest to protect Vadra and his friend's commercial interests. Referring to Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's statements in Pakistan long back that Narendra Modi needs to be removed as the prime minister, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra drew a parallel between the Opposition party and Pakistani leaders, saying ""both want Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed from Indian politics"".

FP Staff,"In a blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, the Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), has rejected BJP chief Amit Shah's 20:20 seat-sharing formula for the polls. ""I neither play cricket, nor do I understand this 20:20 formula. I prefer playing   instead,""   quoted RLSP president Upendra Kushwaha as saying. The NDA in Bihar presently constitutes the JD(U), BJP, RLSP and Union minister Ramvilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). According to Shah's proposed deal with NDA allies in Bihar, the BJP would get 20 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the Janata Dal (United) would get 12, the LJP would get 12 and the RLSP, two. The BJP was reported to have sought a higher number of seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in view of its better-than-expected performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Only days earlier, the RLSP had blamed Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) for creating ""confusion"" over seat-sharing within the ruling coalition in the state. The RLSP's attack on the JD(U) came in the backdrop of media reports after a meeting between Kumar and Shah in Delhi recently. Last week, RLSP leader Nagmani had urged the BJP to part ways with the JD(U), saying, ""The BJP should get rid of the JD(U), which has a social support base of 1.5 percent, while the RLSP has a social support base of 10 percent."" Nagmani also claimed that there was pressure to force the RLSP to walk away from the BJP-led NDA in Bihar. ""The BJP will be a major loser if the RLSP joins the grand alliance of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and Hindustani Awam Morcha,"" he said. RJD spokesperson Murtanjay Tiwari had also claimed that the RLSP would soon join the grand alliance. According to  , the RLSP president had sought eight seats for the party in the Opposition grand alliance. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav offered him six seats instead, which he is said to have accepted. Recently, Kushwaha had   about the growing warmth between his party and the RJD in rather colourful terms. He had quipped, ""When the milk from Yadavs and rice from Kushwahas are mixed together, it makes for good kheer."" He had also indicated his dissatisfaction with the NDA in July, when he skipped an   party organised by the JD(U) in Patna. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested from 30 seats in Bihar and won 22, while the LJP had won six seats and the RLSP, three. The JD(U) had contested on its own in 2014, but had performed poorly, winning only two seats. As this   points out, Kushwahas and Kurmis together constitute the second most dominant OBC caste group after the Yadavs. However, as Kushwaha has been seeking to expand his base beyond the Kushwaha-Kurmi axis, due to which he has developed differences with Nitish Kumar.",2018-09-24,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Amit Shah,BIhar,Bihar Seat Sharing,BJP,BJP Allies,JD(U),Lok Sabha Elections,Lok Sabha Polls,Nagmani,NDA,NewsTracker,Nitish Kumar,RLSP,Upendra Kushwaha",Blow to BJP in Bihar: Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP rejects Amit Shah's 20:20 seat-sharing formula for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/blow-to-bjp-in-bihar-upendra-kushwahas-rlsp-rejects-amit-shahs-2020-seat-sharing-formula-for-lok-sabha-polls-5250711.html,firstpost,-1,0

The BJP, which has called the bandh to protest the killing of two students in a clash with police in North Dinajpur district on Thursday, however, claimed that the shutdown would be a complete success as the people of Islampur and the entire state is fed up with the ""misrule of the TMC"". TMC secretary general and state education minister minister Partha Chatterjee charged the BJP with trying to foment trouble in the state by calling the shutdown, and said all steps will be taken to ensure normal life on the day.  State-run buses will ply and a notification will be issued for state government employees to attend office on the bandh day, he said, adding commercial establishments and private education institutes would be urged to function normally on that day. Senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha accused the TMC government of letting loose ""police raj and goonda raj"" in the state and claimed the people of West Bengal would make the 12-hour shutdown a grand success. ""The TMC government has completely failed to maintain law and order in the state. There is a complete lawless situation in the state,"" he alleged. Reacting to Partha Chatterjee's comments, Sinha said the TMC's reaction only showed that the state government is ""nervous"" and wants to use the police to ensure that the shutdown did not take place. ""The 26 September shutdown will be a complete success and it will be an expression of people's anger against the anti-people government,"" he said. Meanwhile, the All India Minority Forum on Monday moved a PIL before the Calcutta High Court seeking direction to the BJP to withdraw its call for the shutdown. Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali, a practising lawyer, prayed before a division bench presided by Chief Justice J Bhattacharya for an injunction restraining the BJP from giving effect to the bandh call. Two students were killed when a mob clashed with police over entry of newly appointed Urdu teachers in Daribhita School in North Dinajpur's Islampur as the protesting students said they needed science and english teachers. The BJP and locals have alleged that the two, who were former students of the school, were killed in police firing but the superintendent of police of North Dinajpur, Sumit Kumar, had said the police did not open fire. The SP had, however, admitted that the students had received bullet injuries and had said the police were investigating who had opened fire. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said his party had no option but to call the bandh and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident. ""We have demanded a CBI probe into the Islampur incident. The chief minister is claiming the police did not resort to firing. Then who killed the two students?

Sameer Yasir,"Firstpost ***  The recent killings by unknown gunmen, suspected to be militants, have sent shock waves across Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir, with leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fearing that the renewed violence may reduce their chances of winning a majority in the upcoming local elections in one of the most troubled towns of the region. On Monday, local residents found another body in an orchard. The deceased, identified as Mushtaq Ahmed Mir, was abducted and later found at least 3 kilometres from his house in Sopore's Harwan village. Harwan and its adjoining villages had witnessed a remarkable polling percentage in the last panchayat elections, held in 2011 after decades. A small hamlet of about 200 houses, Harwan is located on the foothills of the Yamberzal mountains in Sopore town.  two days before his killing. The police said a masked gunman had entered Mir's house in Harwan around 8.30 pm on Sunday and abducted him. The Block Medical Officer of Sopore, Dr Sami, said Mir's body bore multiple bullet wounds. ""There were a few cuts on his head, inflicted by some blunt object, and a few bullet wounds on legs and hip,"" he added. Habla Begum, the physically challenged wife of the slain labourer, said the gunmen had covered their face and asked her husband to accompany them, claiming they had lost their way. ""He said goodbye to me with a terrified face,"" she said. ""When I told them my husband is innocent, they promised me they will release him after 10 minutes. I want to ask them, why was he killed? What was his sin?"" said . At least three dozen villagers offered Mir's funeral prayers on Monday afternoon, with dozens of women were beating their chests to mourn his tragic killing. The villagers said Mir was a low-rung political worker who had played a crucial role in the last panchayat and Assembly elections in his area. His is the third killing in Sopore's Harwan village this year, and people suspect that the previous two men were  . Behind Harwan, in the backdrop of towering, lush, green peaks, a road leads to the Lolab Valley, where security forces say many foreign militants have taken refuge. The only thing that separates Harwan and Lolab is an army camp that sits atop mountains. Due to the rising violence, the BJP constituency in-charge of Sopore, Farooq Ahmad Rather, is now a worried man. He was hoping that the situation would remain ""as it as"" as his party's chances had brightened after both the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) decided to boycott the municipal and panchayat polls, seeking clarity on the Centre's stand on Article 35A of the Constitution. ""I had 15 people ready to fight the elections, and they would have won hands down because they had no opposition at all. But only six people are ready now after Mir's killing,” Rather said. ""These killings have created a kind of terror that will stay in the minds of people for a long time."" The right-wing party sees the killings as a ""blunt message"" to the political leaders and activists who may want to participate in the upcoming municipal and panchayat polls. Sopore town and its adjoining villages in North Kashmir were  , much before South Kashmir become the epicentre of such violence. It was, and still remains, the bastion of pro-Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami. Kashmir's tallest separatist leader, Syed Ali Geelani, represented the Sopore constituency three times in the Legislative Assembly. In fact, he remains the only elected representative to garner the highest number of votes in the history of the town before the state plunged into a political turmoil in the early nineties. For some time, the town remained out-of-bounds for security forces, until 1993, when the army launched one of the biggest combing operation in the Kashmir Valley. Despite massive human rights violations and a developmental deficit — the roads in Sopore are a perfect case of underdevelopment — it still is one of the richest towns of Jammu and Kashmir. The money generated by the apple economy has made it financially vibrant. Ghulam Rasool Dar, the former mayor of the Municipal Council of Sopore, said that despite lack of funds and their belief in grassroots democracy in the worst of times, he had begged the chief of local bodies and politicians to help them at least change the situation of the roads. ""They just wanted us to contest the polls and then get killed. They had no plans to develop any part of Sopore or any other area of Kashmir,"" Dar said. When asked whether he would stand in the local body elections, the former councilman said, ""The question doesn't even arise."" Not one person has submitted his nomination form for the municipal elections in Sopore, the deadline for which is 27 September. Baramulla, Handwara and other areas of North Kashmir face the same situation. The latest killings have affected the BJP's electoral calculus of taking over the Sopore municipality and panchayat. The party was banking on the boycott by two major regional parties and the Congress, whose MLA represents the constituency. ""More than anything, these killings have dampened the spirit of the people associated with us,"" Rather said.

Their own advisers will tell them that the more muck they fling at us, the wider the lotus will bloom,"" Modi said, in an apparent reference to allegations on the Rafale fighter jet deal. He made the statement while addressed a gathering of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in Bhopal ahead of the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh later this year. BJP president Amit Shah, too, addressed the rally, along with Chief Minster Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In his address, the prime minister said that the BJP government believes in social justice for all and that its ' ' (cooperation of all, development of all) campaign is not just a slogan. He expressed confidence that the BJP would emerge victorious in the upcoming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh as well as in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Talking about BJP being a tolerant party, Modi said: ""We are a party that welcomes and follows the ideology of Deendayal Upadhyay and Syama Prasad Mukherjee. We welcome all streams of thoughts."" Drawing from Shah's statement from two days ago, the prime minister compared vote-bank politics to termites, saying, ""Vote-bank politics has caused immense damage to the country in the 70 years after Independence."" Attacking the Congress, Modi said, ""The Congress is not ready to introspect on why it has been reduced to just 44 seats in the Lok Sabha because of its arrogance... The Congress has become a burden on the country today. It is the responsibility of BJP workers in a democracy to save the country from it."" He also urged people to show the Congress party its place. ""The Congress was the party that treated Madhya Pradesh as their enemy. Till the time the UPA was in power at the Centre, they tried every trick in the book to impede the BJP government's work,"" Modi spoke. Accusing the Congress of colluding with foreign powers to gain power in India, Modi accused the Congress of looking outside India to form an alliance as its efforts to form a ""mahagathbandha"" in India seemed to be failing. Modi also claimed that this grand alliance was being formed before the Opposition was afraid of losing elections. He mocked the Congress, saying that the 125-year-old party has been reduced to such a condition that it is ""begging"" with small parties for alliances. He asserted that the coalition will not be successful even if the Congress does succeed in getting allies. During his address, Shah encouraged party workers to be prepared to take BJP's work to every voter in every booth. For this, the BJP chief said it was important that they use the NaMo app as it will help them be informed about the schemes and policies implemented by the BJP government. Taking a dig at the Congress, Shah said: ""The Congress party has faced a rout in most of the past elections, and yet its president Rahul Gandhi is dreaming about a win. There is no harm in dreaming, but even dreams should have some base in reality."" Shah also alleged that the Congress made Madhya Pradesh a ""  state"" (weak state) and lowered its contribution to the GDP to pre-Independence levels. He also questioned the basis on which the grand old party was seeking votes. The BJP president also lauded the efforts of the party for its recent electoral successes, urging party workers to take a vow to ensure BJP's win in the five upcoming Assembly polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Praising the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Shah said: ""I was surprised to see Shivraj Singh Chouhan   counting scheme after scheme implemented in the state, without even consulting a paper.

Ishita Mishra,"Pooja Shukla, a commerce student from the Lucknow University (LU), wanted to gain admission into a course of her choice. She took the entrance test in June this year and waited for the result, which was later withheld by the authorities. Now, in order to know whether she has passed the test, she has to submit an affidavit in the Lucknow High Court promising that she will never take part in any activity in the university, nor will she engage in university politics. She can't even enter the campus premises if she is accompanied by more than one other student, and she can't go to the seminar hall. Pooja is not shocked by this directive from the court. For her, things have never been easy since the day she entered the university and ""countered"" those in power. She says her miseries have only increased ever since she had a brush with chief minister Yogi Adityanath last year. She attained both stardom and a notorious reputation after obstructing Yogi Adityanath's convoy and waving black flags to it. He was visiting the campus to unveil a statue of Shivaji in June 2017. She says she is one among 20 students who are being denied admission into the Lucknow University for staging this protest. “The reason why we showed him black flags was simple: We, as ordinary students, wanted to gain the attention of our chief minister. We wanted him to ask us why we are protesting; in response, we would have told him about the mismanagement taking place in the university, which includes the hooliganism of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), and the fee hike. But the chief minister termed us naxals. We were detained and later arrested,"" she says. She adds that most of the organisers and attendees of the event were part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). She also alleged that the event had been organised by the university with students' money, while the administration would allegedly continue to claim that it could not waive off the fees of underprivileged students, or that it could not provide better facilities citing the lack of funds. It seems that she sees life as being either black or white. She believes that even people and situations are either right or wrong, that there cannot exist a ‘compromise’ between the two. After being arrested, Pooja was sent to jail for 26 days. The sections of the Indian Penal Code she was charged with include 307 (attempt to murder) and 7 (the Criminal Law Amendment). She was also charged with rioting, obstructing a public servant from performing his duty and intimidation of a public servant. Once she was released, she says she decided to work full-time for the rights of students against the mismanagement happening at LU, with the aid of the Samajwadi Party (SP). She also joined the SP officially in July 2017. Abhishek Dixit, Pooja’s lawer, says he doesn’t expect any help for his client from the court, which has asked her to submit an affidavit with 'strange' clauses. “Isn’t the demand of an affidavit stating that she won’t go to college or even stand in the premises with more than one student bizarre? The court denied our plea to quash the application so that we wouldn't get relief from the upper courts,” he says. But Pooja is of the opinion that she did not earn the ire of LU all of a sudden. She is the daughter of an employee who works in the private sector, and the eldest among three sisters. Her parents were reluctant about her decision to seek admission in the university. “My parents were never happy with my decision to apply to the university instead of a girl’s college, but I managed to convince them. When I joined the university, my aim was quite clear: Get a degree in commerce and find a job in a good company. But things turned out very differently. The atrocities committed in the university, especially against poor students, worried me. Amid these adversities, I became exposed to the culture of debate and social activism. And I'm being treated as a criminal only because I ask questions,” says Pooja. She speaks about how she actively began participating in student politics. “I observed rampant eve-teasing and harassment of juniors the day I first joined the university. When one of my friends was eve-teased by a senior, I yelled at him and forced him to apologise. I was told that girls cannot enter the university from gate number one, and I was the first to do that too. In November 2015, I joined the All India Students' Association (AISA), the student wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation.” She graduated from LU with first division in 2016, and later, took a drop from studies for next two years. She says that her reasons for taking a drop are personal. However, her participation in university politics continued. The turning point in her life, Pooja says, was the decision to be part of the protests that followed the brutal gangrape in Delhi in 2012. She says it defined who she is today; it was at that time that she developed a sensitivity towards women and activism. Pooja is angered by patriarchal mindsets, which she refers to as ' '. A kind of aggression surfaces when she speaks of the LU Vice Chancellor or proctor, or active members of student politics, who are all men. She also vehemently opposes the ABVP, who have shown a similar reaction to her. She claims that the university is being run by a Vice Chancellor chosen by the RSS. “They know I am trouble for them. I will raise my voice, I will question what is wrong. This is why I am being denied admission.” Pooja also went on a hunger strike, demanding that the university give admission to all students who had appeared for the entrance tests, and whose results were being held back for waving black flags at the chief minister. “When I approached the university administration, I was told that it doesn't admit students with ""criminal backgrounds"". Despite having secured first class marks in all my previous classes, I am not able to study further because I am fighting for what is right, and I'm doing it the right way,” says Pooja. She had to call off her hunger protest after the doctors advised her about her deteriorating health. When asked if she is afraid of the police and those who are in power, Pooja just laughs. “I have been randomly picked up by the police so many times, that now, I am just not afraid. I know they can’t do anything to me because I am not guilty. They can raid my house in Sarojini Nagar, they can keep me under house arrest or threaten me, but I am not afraid."" She's convinced that she has seen the worst that life has to offer. Her arrest has had an effect on the lives of her family. Her sisters were afraid to step out of the house while she was in jail. “My father had to hear offensive taunts from both within and outside the family... I am not sure about what will happen to my career after such serious charges were slapped on me. If there is anything left for me in life, it is the fight."" Many seem to draw strength from her spirit. Everyone present at the Sheroes Cafe, the place we decide to meet which is run by an acid attack survivor, knows her personally. She claims that people line up to get pictures clicked with her. Her phone never stops ringing once she wakes up every morning. When asked about her political goals, Pooja claims that she will enter politics if people want her to, but for the time being, she wants to pursue her education and fight for students and their rights. Notably, while Pooja remained extremely vocal about several things, such as the BJP, ABVP, the RSS, Yogi Adityanath and even Narendra Modi, the students themselves occupied very little space in the entire conversation, which lasted for over two hours. “There is so much to talk about these people that sometimes I just lose focus,” she says with a smile. Why join the Samajwadi Party, considering the reputation Akhilesh Yadav has gained after the infighting within the family? “It was all because of Shivpal Yadav and his  . His goons were not letting young people, especially women, to grow in the party. Now the SP is a democratic place where all voices are being heard,” she says. Pooja’s reaction changes when she is asked about how Akhilesh Yadav can be her role model, when he directed his own wife to not to contest the elections in 2019. “Who said he stopped her? Who knows whether she wanted this herself? Or maybe she wants to work in the party,” she says. The BJP might win the 2019 elections. How long will she continue to fight? Pooja smiles and recites the line she wrote to all her supporters from jail. “ .”",2018-09-25,"ABVP,Akhilesh Yadav,BJP,LU,Lucknow University,Pooja Shukla,RSS,S&P,Samajwadi Party,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Aditynath","Pooja Shukla on fighting Lucknow University over admissions, why she waved black flags at Yogi Adityanath",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/pooja-shukla-on-fighting-lucknow-university-over-admissions-why-she-waved-black-flags-at-yogi-adityanath-5251831.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," Attacking its ally for retaining an ""ailing"" Manohar Parrikar as Goa chief minister, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday criticised the ""cruel and inhuman politics"" of the BJP and alleged the party was scared about losing the state. There is ""anarchy"" prevailing in the coastal state in Parrikar's absence, the Sena claimed, adding the party was grappling with the problem of who could replace Parrikar as it does not have anyone ""suitable"" for the top post. The 62-year-old Goa chief minister is currently admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi because of a pancreatic ailment. ""Parrikar is not in Goa. He is undergoing treatment for cancer at a hospital in Delhi. The state administration is in doldrums in the chief minister's absence,"" the Sena claimed in an editorial in the party mouthpiece ' '. Running the government by retaining Parrikar as the chief minister is not just an injustice to Goa but to him as well. ""Forcibly thrusting the post on him is cruel and inhuman politics,"" it said.

""Stress is not good for his current fragile (health) condition, but who will explain this to the BJP high command? They are more scared about losing the state than Parrikar's health.

Ajay Singh,"  *** Consistency is often seen as banal and non-intellectual ever since Karl Marx coined the phrase, “History repeats itself; first as tragedy and then as farce”. The consistency of history tends to get intellectual interpretation through the prism of this axiom very often. In the case of the Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the consistency of its objective and broader discourse is ignored to invent a proposition which may appear innovative or thought-provoking. It happened when the RSS organised a three-day conference in mid-September to reach out to critics and non-conformists of Delhi’s elites. When RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, in his 19 September address on  , insisted on his organisation’s inclusive ( ) approach to society, some have analysed it as a rap on the knuckle of the BJP’ political leadership which is bent upon making India free of the Congress (Congress-  Bharat). His praise for the older generation of the Congress leadership is seen as a well-deserved rebuke to an ""upstart"" BJP leadership that is apparently drunk on the arrogance of power. Some have drawn vicarious pleasure from what they perceive as the emerging dissonance between Bhagwat and the BJP leadership on national issues as they find the opposition led by Rahul Gandhi quite inadequate to weave an effective counter-narrative. But a glance at the RSS’ history would be indicative of a canny consistency with which it has been approaching the national issues and changing its views with the changing times. Over the decades, the RSS has adapted itself to the transformations in Indian society and polity and recalibrated its approach on various issues. The conference at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi was an important sequel to that change. Right since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the RSS has faced many trials and public scrutiny to establish its credentials as a genuine “socio-cultural organisation” committed to the consolidation of the Hindus. It was proscribed by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948 after Gandhi’s murder and again by his daughter Indira Gandhi in 1975 after the imposition of the Emergency. On both occasions, the RSS was blamed for carrying out a “secretive and subversive mission” that promoted violence and disaffection in society, a charge that has been levelled quite frequently and liberally but never been proven legally. And this formed the basis of a perception about the RSS which continued to be understood from a particular prism. But the remarkable flexibility that the RSS leadership had often shown to adapt to the times is often ignored to perpetuate a particular narrative that stereotyped the RSS and its constituents. Now let us recall the manner in which the RSS, under Balasahab Deoras (the third Sarsanghachalak during the eventful period between 1973 and 1994), had thrown itself open for Muslims in the post-Emergency phase. This was a transformative event for an organisation committed to the cause of the Hindus. There is no doubt that Deoras’s move was audacious even as it evoked criticism from within the fold. In an authentic account of that period,   (2011), Sanjeev Kelkar refers to the criticism faced by Deoras and points out that Maharashtra RSS chief KB Limaye wrote a letter expressing his anguish. His letter reads, “You have been given the position of the chief of the RSS of Dr Hedgewar. Kindly run that Sangh and try to foster its growth. Do not try to change it. If you think a change is necessary, start a new RSS. Leave the RSS of Doctorji for Hindu consolidation to us. If you change this RSS, I will not be able to have any relationship with that Sangh.” Of course, Deoras remained unfazed and continued with his experiment. It will be quite instructive to know how this new experiment came about. When Indira had put Deoras and many other RSS functionaries in jail during the Emergency, they found themselves in company with leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami. Both took the opportunity to interact with each other and got to know each other better while the tyranny of the Emergency was at its peak. In the post-Emergency phase, Deoras displayed an enormous sagacity not only to let its political affiliate, Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), merge its identity with the Janata Party but also promised to undertake initiatives dispel misconceptions about the RSS. He allowed Muslims to examine the RSS from close quarters. Those who are surprised at Bhagwat’s assertion that Hindutva would be incomplete without Muslims are oblivious of yet another instance which was quite radical in its approach. After the Emergency, a group of Muslim clergy went to meet RSS leaders at its Nagpur headquarters. As the discussion was prolonged, they became anxious as it was time for their  . The hosts asked them if they could offer prayers there itself — within the RSS headquarters — and they said, yes. Indeed, that day the group of Muslim clergy said their prayers in the RSS headquarters. Perhaps, against the backdrop of the Emergency, the bonhomie between the RSS and the Muslims was at its peak. If you have any doubt then look at the utterances of Mohamed Ali Currim Chagla, a noted jurist and former Union minister, who praised the RSS and described himself as “Muslim by religion and Hindu by race” much to the annoyance of orthodox Muslims and liberal Muslims alike. The end of the Emergency did not mean an end of the RSS’s travails. The BJS members who were now part of the Janata Party were targeted over the ‘dual membership’ as socialists questioned their allegiance to both the party and the RSS. However, much before the issue of the dual membership was raised as a pretext to break the Janata Party and bring down the anti-Congress coalition, there were several instances when the tallest leaders from the socialist block, like Madhu Limaye and Madhu Dandvate, sang paeans for the RSS and its contribution to nation-building. When the wrangling began in the Janata Parivar over the RSS, Deoras promptly issued a letter that freed its workers to follow their discretion in choosing a political course. The implicit message was that the RSS would not influence its volunteers’ political preferences. Once again, Deoras faced severe criticism within the saffron fold for his move. Now read Bhagwat’s statement on Muslims with the post-Emergency changes brought about in the RSS by his predecessor, you will find a consistency. This clearly flies in the face of argument advanced by intellectual patricians (ironically drawn mainly from the Marxist stream) that the RSS is driven by a pernicious ideology that promotes orthodoxy, dogma and intolerance. Perhaps the RSS leadership has faced more criticism from within for pursuing a course of reform that runs contrary to traditionalists beholden to dogmas. Bhagwat’s exposition in Delhi is perfectly in sync with the organisation’s unique flexibility to adapt to change.",2018-09-27,"Balasahab Deoras,Bharatiya Jana Sangh,BJP,Congress,Hindu,Hindutva,Indira Gandhi,InMyOpinion,Jamaat-E-Islami,Janata Party,Jawaharlal Nehru,Mahatma Gandhi,Mohan Bhagwat,Muslims,Narendra Modi,Narendra Modi And The RSS,Rahul Gandhi,Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh,RSS",Narendra Modi and the RSS: Why Mohan Bhagwat remarks are contemporaneous and yet consistent with history,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/narendra-modi-and-the-rss-why-mohan-bhagwat-remarks-are-contemporaneous-and-yet-consistent-with-history-5260281.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,": The BJP is facing ""infighting and groupism"" in Rajasthan which is evident from the two separate campaigns being run by party president Amit Shah and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, Congress' state unit chief Sachin Pilot said Sunday, while asserting that all senior leaders in his party were on the same page. Pilot, who is spearheading the Congress charge against the Raje government, exuded confidence of a big win in poll-bound Rajasthan. In an interview to  , Pilot said that as the state unit chief, he has given his inputs on the issue of alliance and now it was up to party president Rahul Gandhi to take a final call on it. ""I am very proud that Rajasthan has very strong and very tall leaders in the Congress party. All of them have contributed immensely to make the party as strong as it is today...   (the more leaders there are, the better it is,"" Pilot said, rejecting BJP's criticism of infighting in the Congress. His remarks come following Shah's swipe at the Congress that it should decide whether it will be Pilot or Ashok Gehlot who will be the party's chief ministerial candidate. Countering BJP's contention, Pilot said that on the contrary, it was the BJP that was grappling with ""infighting and groupism"". ""It is the BJP where Shah is campaigning separately in Rajasthan and the chief minister is campaigning separately. ""Amit Shah could not for 75 days get the (state) president of his choice, he had to buckle under the pressure of Vasundhara ji and have a compromise candidate as the BJP president,"" he said. On the raging Rafale issue, Pilot asserted that the BJP will have to give answers on the ""scam"" as it is bound to be a ""burning issue"" in the minds of the people in the upcoming assembly elections. He said the ""revelations"" by former French president Francois Hollande have left ""no doubt"" that there had been corruption in the Rafale deal. In a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll promises, Pilot said claims were made that   (will not indulge in corruption and will not allow others to indulge in it too), and now the government has been ""caught red-handed"". Pilot, who has been touring Rajasthan as part of the party's Sankalp Yatra, said the Congress was eyeing a win in all five Assembly elections as it was well placed in the poll-bound states. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana are expected to go to polls before the end of 2018 and both the Congress and the BJP are gearing up to take each other on in a contest that will set the tone for the 2019 general election. ""In Rajasthan, we are focussing on winning the elections and winning it comprehensively,"" Pilot said. On Raje's recent criticism of him, the 41-year-old leader said if she chooses to make personal allegations and attacks, then the people will give a befitting reply to those charges. Asked about the party's crowdfunding campaign for the Rajasthan Assembly polls, Pilot said it was an All India Congress Committee (AICC) initiative. ""What we have decided is to involve the people as much as possible. So, apart from the small financial contributions that people want to make, it is also about the connect that people (are able to) have,"" he said, adding that the Congress does not want to succumb to the threats of corporate lobbies.

Press Trust of India,": Delhi's ruling AAP will focus on winning at least 25 seats out of the 100 it plans to contest in the next Lok Sabha election to better position itself in case of a non-BJP government formation, two party leaders said Sunday. ""In the emerging political scenario, winning 25 Lok Sabha seats will ensure the AAP is in a 'comfortable' position to strike a bargain with other parties after the general election in 2019,"" a senior party leader said. ""The party is eyeing 100 potential seats. We will do whatever it takes to win at least 25 seats, particularly in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, where we have a strong presence and effective organisational set up,"" the leader said. ""The party will contest Lok Sabha polls in the three states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh - where Assembly elections are due later in 2018, besides focusing on Delhi, Haryana and Punjab,"" he said. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are other states where it plans to contest selected Lok Sabha seats. The AAP currently holds four Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. ""The state has 13 Lok Sabha seats and the AAP would work to raise its tally as it is an Opposition party in Punjab Assembly,"" another party leader said. ""AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently visited areas in Haryana, where state party head Navin Jaihind has been able to strengthen the organisation in several constituencies,"" he said. ""We will work hard to pose a tough challenge to BJP and Congress on all the 10 seats in Haryana,"" he said. In the run-up to the elections, the AAP leadership has upped the ante against the Narendra Modi government, with Kejriwal targeting the prime minister on the political controversy around the purchase of 36 Rafale fighters from France. Kejriwal Saturday demanded that Modi call a special session of Parliament to discuss the Rafale deal. On Friday, he asked the BJP-led central government to come clean on the deal in light of former French president Francois Hollande's purported interview to a French language publication. On Sunday, the two AAP leaders said a mix of local and national issues would be helpful in achieving success in the next Lok Sabha poll. Other party leaders, including Kejriwal, have been lately saying in their public meetings that if AAP had won Delhi's seven seats in 2014, it would have handled issues such as the ongoing drive to seal illegal commercial establishment in a more effective way.

Press Trust of India," Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will continue in his post, BJP president Amit Shah said on Sunday as he announced that a reshuffle of the state's ministers will soon take place. The BJP chief said so in a tweet following a discussion with the party's core group team from Goa. ""It has been decided during a discussion with the Goa BJP core team that Manohar Parrikar will continue to lead the Goa government. There will soon be a reshuffle of ministers and their portfolios,"" he said. Parrikar's poor health has sparked speculation over his continuation as chief minister of Goa, and Shah recently sent a team of central party leaders to the coastal state to speak to allies and take stock of the political situation there. The opposition Congress, which is the single-largest party in the state, has staked claim to form the government. The BJP has asserted that its government continues to have the support of a majority of MLAs. Parrikar is admitted to AIIMS and undergoing treatment for pancreatic ailment. The reshuffle of ministers will be aimed at consolidating support for the BJP-led alliance government as the Congress is looking for signs of discontent to topple the Goa government. In the 40-member state assembly, the Parrikar-led government has the support of 23 MLAs. The BJP has 14 MLAs against 16 of the Congress, and Parrikar's appeal was a key reason behind its success in securing support from a cross-section of legislators following last year elections.

Press Trust of India," The Karnataka wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy of sedition and sought action over h  for its alleged attempts to destabilise the state government. In its complaint to the state Director General of Police (DGP) Neelamani N Raju, the BJP alleged that the chief minister had violated section 124(A) (relating to sedition) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Holding placards and raising slogans against former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and his sons, including Kumaraswamy, the BJP staged a protest near the Mysore Bank Circle, the nerve centre of the city, terming the chief minister's remark as a ""call for anarchy."" ""Kumaraswamy, who holds a constitutional post, has given a call for people to rise in revolt,"" BJP MP from Udupi Chikkamagaluru constituency Shobha Karandlaje said.

Another BJP parliamentarian Prahlad Joshi termed the statement as the ""most irresponsible and unpardonable offence"" and said the chief minister's choice of words displayed his state of mind. Upset over the alleged toppling game of the BJP, an angry Kumaraswamy had on Thursday warned BJP to be restrained in its speech about Gowda and his family, saying he can even ask people to rise in revolt against it if it continued to disturb Congress-Janata Dal-Secular coalition government headed by him.

Press Trust of India," Samajwadi Party (SP) patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday appeared on the same platform as party president Akhilesh Yadav during a rally in Delhi, in an apparent setback to brother Shivpal Yadav who has floated his own outfit. After forming the Samajwadi Secular Morcha, Shivpal Yadav had claimed that he has the blessings of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Attending the concluding event of a cycle rally at Jantar Mantar, the SP patriarch told party workers to make sure that the Samajwadi Party forms government in Uttar Pradesh and has a share in Delhi politics. He also urged the party workers not to indulge in corruption and asserted that the country, farmers and youth will be empowered only when SP gets stronger. ""There are over two crore unemployed people in the country. I asked the prime minister what happened to providing jobs and Rs 15 lakh to everybody. I told him that he cheated the people and formed government based on lies. There is no difference between what Samajwadi Party promises and actions,"" Mulayam Singh Yadav said. ""I will also tell Akhilesh Yadav to involve women in various committees and have them at various party levels starting from the block,"" he said. Demanding a caste census in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said, ""Social justice in the state is possible only when there is a caste census."" He alleged that hospitals in the state treat patients based on their cast and, the police take action after determining the caste of the complainants. Akhilesh Yadav wondered whether demonetization has helped in checking corruption and flow of back money. He also alleged that 50,000 farmers have committed suicide till now and lakhs of factories have been closed down. ""There are no opportunities of employment. Sugarcane farmers are an unhappy lot as their dues are still pending and the chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) says that excess production of sugarcane causes diabetes.

""The Modi government should tell why the offset contract was given to Reliance Defence.

Debobrat Ghose,"Hardly four months ago, in a rare photo op, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati had come together on stage in Bengaluru at the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy as Karnataka chief minister and displayed bonhomie that was rarer still. The reticent Sonia, who is not known for public display of emotion, was seen totally at ease in Mayawati's company as the two seemed to share a disarming laugh over something. Congress president Rahul Gandhi also joined the duo and waved at the public with a smile, probably giving a message they were on way for a successful grand alliance (Mahagathbandhan). The importance of the moment had not been lost on political pundits as that photograph lent credence to speculation that the Congress and the BSP may be on road to a strong alliance for the 2018 Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha election. On Thursday, however, that Sonia-Mayawati photograph was recalled by many who reacted with surprise over the latter's decision to not join hands with the Congress but with the first Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janta Congress in Chhattisgarh for the upcoming state Assembly elections. The field is now open to conjecture about the possible alliance in the poll-bound state of Rajasthan, as BSP has also announced its first list of 22 candidates in Madhya Pradesh that it will contest independently (as of now) in the upcoming state Assembly elections. This move by the BSP, on choosing to enter the poll fray without an alliance with the Congress, puts a big question mark on that elusive Mahagathbandhan, which the collective Opposition has been attempting to put together against the BJP for the past several months. Right from local leaders in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to Rahul Gandhi – all had hinted from time to time that ‘talks were on towards a possible alliance and seat sharing’. While the failure at stitching an alliance has dampened Congress’ winning prospect in Chhattisgarh, it has put the ruling BJP a step ahead of others; it may be considered as a victory for the BJP in preventing the alliance from being formed. Whenever the discussion on the issue of an alliance has surfaced, Mayawati has always been clear about her stand – the BSP will contest elections as part of a coalition government only if it gets a respectable number of seats. In the 90-member Chhattisgarh Assembly, BSP will contest 35 seats and Janta Congress on 55 seats. “Sharing seats with the BSP was a sticky situation as Chhattisgarh Congress leadership wasn’t comfortable with the number of seats BSP demanded. Congress could have hardly benefitted out of it,” a Raipur-based Congress leader told  A similar indecisiveness prevailed in Madhya Pradesh as well. During its initial rounds of pre-poll alliance discussions, the Madhya Pradesh Congress offered 30 seats to BSP, but Mayawati insisted upon 50. Meanwhile, the upper caste (Savarna) agitation broke out in Madhya Pradesh against the amendments in the SC/ST (Atrocities) Act. Considering it as an apt opportunity, the BSP recently announced its first list of 22 candidates for Madhya Pradesh. The state president of BSP, Pradeep Ahirhar said that the party would field candidates on all the 230 seats. In the last Assembly election in 2013, the BSP had fielded 227 candidates and barring a few exceptions, they had performed badly. Currently, the BSP has four MLAs in the state. Out of the 22 seats on which BSP has declared its candidates, five are ST reserved seats. It may prove damaging for the Congress. Post-Savarna agitation, a section within the Madhya Pradesh Congress believed that an alliance with the BSP, would antagonise ‘Savarnas’ and dampen the winning prospects of Congress. Meanwhile, in a surprise move to win over the Savarnas, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that without prior investigation, no one would be arrested under the SC/ST (Atrocities) Act. “This announcement is a kind of safeguard that the chief minister has taken to prevent his image which he has built over the last 14 years as an unbiased leader who doesn’t indulge in narrow caste and minority politics. In the practical sense, it doesn’t matter as the state doesn’t have the power to over-rule an Act passed by the Parliament unless it’s amended. But, Chouhan announced it to win over Savarnas, OBCs and minorities, who’re at present against SCs and STs due to the Act,” Bhopal-based journalist Prabhu Pateria said. “Moreover, if Congress-BSP alliance doesn’t materialise, the BJP will undoubtedly be benefitted,” he said. In the 200-member Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, 34 seats are reserved for the Scheduled Caste. Barring two, rest of the seats are with the BJP at present. The local Congress leadership in Rajasthan is divided over a possible alliance with the BSP. A section strongly feels that there’s no need to form an alliance. And, it all depends on Mayawati whether BSP would agree to Congress’ offer if at all it’s made. The future of Mahagathbandhan or a grand alliance with Congress and BSP on the same platform depends largely on the outcome of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan Assembly polls. The Uttar Pradesh Congress leadership is confident that a grand alliance will formalise in the state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election to take on the ruling BJP. But, one would recall that during the last Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Congress could enter an alliance with Samajwadi Party only. The BSP stayed out of it. Needless to say, it has been the efforts of Sonia that have always brought other opposition parties together with the Congress. Whether it’s Mayawati or Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee, they have never overlooked Sonia’s call. However, Congress president Rahul doesn’t seem to inspire same faith among the opposition leaders. Unlike Sonia, who has managed to bring the opposition parties together on particular issues against the Narendra Modi government from time-to-time, Rahul’s surprise move to meet the prime minister along with senior Congress leaders on the farmers’ loan-waiver issue in 2016 bypassing the other opposition leaders created a flutter in their ranks. Rahul’s decision to go solo on an important issue didn’t seem acceptable to the regional satraps who command a huge base within their regions, such as TMC and BSP, and whose presence is absolutely necessary for any Mahagathbandhan to take place. The failure in striking an alliance in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh would have an impact on the Congress party’s strategy for all upcoming elections.",2018-10-26,"2019 Lok Sabha Election,Ajit Jogi,Assembly Election 2018,Bahujan Samaj Party,BSP,Chhattisgarh Assembly Election 2018,HD Kumaraswamy,Janta Congress,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2018,Mahagathbandhan,Mamata Banerjee,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2018,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Sonia Gandhi,Trinamool Congress",Mahagathbandhan at stake as adamant Mayawati nearly abandons Congress ahead of key state elections,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mahagathbandhan-at-stake-as-adamant-mayawati-nearly-abandons-congress-ahead-of-key-state-elections-5235921.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service,"The Congress on Friday alleged that ailing Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar is ""threatening people"" from his hospital room. The party also demanded a medical bulletin on the status of the chief minister, who after being hospitalised in Goa, Mumbai and New York over the last few months, is now being treated for advanced pancreatic cancer at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. ""He may be in the hospital yes. I hope you (Parrikar) are very well but I am getting messages that while sitting in the hospital, you are calling people, threatening them,"" Congress observer for Goa A Chellakumar said. This is the first direct assault by the Congress. The allegation comes a day after Vijai Sardesai, president of coalition ally Goa Forward Party, told the media that Parrikar spoke to him over the phone on Thursday over administrative matters. Chellakumar also said that in view of the Chief Minister's alleged involvement in   which is being probed by the Goa Lokayukta, he should assure the people that he would forfeit his properties if he is found guilty. ""I pray to God even now, let Manohar Parrikar get well soon. Let God give him a long life, but it is my duty also to remind him. All these days you initiated so many actions on so many former ministers. In all the corruption charges, you filed complaints. Moreover, you have attached some of their properties also. Now it is your turn,"" Chellakumar said. The Goa Lokayukta is probing the mining lease allotment scam, in which former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who succeeded Parrikar and held office from 2014 to 2017, is one of the key accused. Parsekar in his affidavit filed before the anti-corruption body has said, that he renewed the bulk of the mining leases by adopting processes put in place by his predecessor and that the renewals were done in adherence to a formal policy, on advice from the advocate general and were in sync with a High Court ruling. The BJP has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless and unsubstantiated"". The Congress observer is in Goa to monitor political developments following Parrikar's hospitalisation that have raised doubts over the continuance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition government. With ruling allies and several Independent MLAs stepping up pressure on the BJP for a greater role in governance as well as on issues related to the choice of a leader of the coalition, the Congress too claims that it is in touch with disgruntled non-BJP MLAs, who Chellakumar said, are keen on a switchover.

Sameer Yasir,"Firstpost ***  When Aasha Bhat, a Kashmiri Pandit, got elected sarpanch in a Muslim-dominated village, politicians and television crews made beelines outside her single-storied, crumbling house in north Kashmir's Wussan village. Her fortunes changed overnight: she became the face of women's empowerment and “hope for the Valley and Kashmiriyat.” She was even invited by Bollywood actor Aamir Khan to appear on his show . It was a feel good story. Her victory symbolised how women can act as a binding force between communities sitting on the fault lines of history. Besides, the participation of women in the last panchyat elections added a different and critical dimension to the whole idea of participatory democracy. It was, so to say, a ‘mini-revolution’ in a conservative region and it combined the idea of women's empowerment with grassroots politics. But reality soon dawned. Aasha and her husband, Radha Krishan, never left Kashmir, unlike the majority of the Kashmiri Pandits. For decades, they lived in abject poverty, but never left their ancestral village. Aasha has been working as a sanitation worker at a local school for the past three decades. Her salary has increased from Rs 25 per day to Rs 75 per day. “When I thought of fighting elections, my Muslims neighbours supported me. I defeated Sarwa Begum by 11 votes,” Aasha, 59, said at her crumbling home. “People had expectations. They wanted to see some change in their lives, but the government did not support us,” she said. “My village is very dear to me. I can’t live outside its boundary. All I wanted was to help my neighbours, but the government did nothing.” Aasha said it is difficult for women to stand against corrupt politicians, who never take women representatives seriously. When she fought for the macadamisation of a road which passes through her village, she ended up paying a bribe for its completion. “From chowkidars to ministers, everyone is corrupt,” she added. “My villages is backward, I wanted it to progress, but I am so fed up now. I have no reason to fight again. That is why I went back to sanitation work at the school,” Aasha Bhat said. “Forget women's empowerment, my own sons mocked me for failing to help the people who had faith in me.” In the 2011 panchayat polls (between 13 April and 27 June), over 79 percent of the electorate exercised their franchise. The process, which stretched over 17 phases, saw 5.07 million voters elect 4,130 sarpanches and 29,719 panchs. The three-month process saw 29 women seal their victory as sarpanches: A dismal success rate of less than one percent. Anantnag and Shopian in south Kashmir elected four women as sarpanches out of 453 posts. Aasha was among them. These women, initially, became local power centres. Wherever they got elected, locals would flock to their homes for birth certificates of their newborns and other small matters. In many places, they ran dispute resolution mechanisms which became an eyesore for political brokers. This also earned them many enemies: they became targets for ‘unknown’ gunmen and at least four of them were killed in the run-up to the election. In January 2013, Zoona Begum was closing the main gate of her home in Sopore's Yemberzalwari area when she was shot by suspected militants.  On that ill-fated day, after more than two years had passed since her election, a stranger appeared at the her door. In a threatening tone, he told Zoona that she ought not to have fought the election. Zoona told him it was “none of his business.” “When I closed the door, I felt something hit my forehead. It felt like a stone,” Zoona added. It was a bullet. The projectile hit her forehead, bore through her mouth and exited on the left side of her neck. “I spent a month in the ICU and then three more years getting medical treatment. It cost more than Rs 6 lakh. My husband had to sell land to pay the medical bills,” Zoona said, speaking from her home in north Kashmir, Scarred for life, Zoona said she will never contest another election. “Because it means nothing,” Zoona added. “It is only to parade elected representatives before TV cameras. I thought concerned women like me will take change of the village affairs and community development, but that was all a cruel joke.” Despite the Jammu and Kashmir government ordering 33 percent reservation for women in 4098 posts of sarpanches and 29,402 panch segments, and call for rotation of wards reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the Valley may yet again witness negligible participation of both men and women in the upcoming panchayat elections due to rising violence. The killing of three policemen in Kapran on Friday sent a clear message. “The threat to our lives and our families is greater this time around,"" Aasha said. “There are more important issues that need to be resolved, and that is why I will not be fighting the election.”",2018-10-04,"All Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference,Bashir Ahmad Magray,ConnectTheDots,Fayaz Ahmad Pandit,J&K Panchayat Polls,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayat Polls,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act,Jehangir Rasool Reshi,Local Body Polls,Militants,NewsTracker,Sopore","Jammu and Kashmir local body polls, Part II: Few women seek office in face of violence from militants, govt apathy",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-local-body-polls-part-ii-few-women-seek-office-in-face-of-violence-from-militants-govt-apathy-5239941.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sant Kumar Sharma,"Last Saturday (15 September) was a very eventful day for Jammu and Kashmir as Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Shaleen Kabra   for elections to urban local bodies (ULBs). On the next day, he made another announcement declaring the schedule for holding of panchayat elections. Earlier, doubts were expressed regarding these elections as two main Kashmir-based regional parties, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had announced that they will boycott them. Another party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had also announced a poll boycott, with lone CPM legislator Yusuf Tarigami making this announcement. Given these boycott calls, it was feared at one time that the government headed by Governor Satya Pal Malik, may backtrack from holding of elections. As if on cue, some reports of targeting buildings of panchayat ghars were received from some rural areas of Kashmir. At most of these places, miscreants set fire to panchayat ghars and this led to some damages to these structures. However, at most of these places, the locals immediately tried to rush in and extinguish these fires. Clearly, the local populace did not want wanton destruction of these community assets. Incidentally, the state unit of the Congress has declared that it will participate both in the elections for the ULBs and the panchayats. The second largest political party in the state, the BJP, which has 25 elected MLAs in the 87-member Legislative Assembly, is also scheduled to take part in these elections. An announcement to this effect was made by the Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir in Srinagar on Wednesday in the presence of senior party leaders. Some party leaders from the Jammu region had also gone to Srinagar to be present at a press conference which Mir addressed. With the Congress present in all the three regions of the state — Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh — the stage is thus set for a show of strength between the BJP and the Congress at most places in the state. It may be recalled that the BJP had parted company with the PDP on 19 June saying the party was withdrawing support to then Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. This had ended the bonhomie between the coalition partners, the PDP and the BJP, which had started with the swearing-in of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed on 1 March, 2015. Interestingly, National Conference patriarch Farooq Abdullah was the first to announce the decision to boycott ULB and panchayat polls. Its arch rival in state politics, the PDP, followed suit some days later. Giving reasons for the boycott of polls, Abdullah said that the atmosphere in the state was not conducive to holding of elections. He claimed that the onslaught on the special status of Jammu and Kashmir had come via litigation against   in the Supreme Court. Is it true that the challenge to Article 35A is the real reason for his party’s decision to boycott the elections? It seems doubtful as the stated reason of boycott call seems to be a ruse or an excuse to try and shore up the NC’s electoral fortunes. It also seems like a clever attempt to play politics and force the rival PDP into a corner by forcing it to follow suit. Of course, the PDP acted along predicted lines and also announced a poll boycott call along with the NC. The two arch rivals, the NC and the PDP, now find themselves on the same page as far as boycotting the elections goes. This also has bracketed them with the separatists, who do not take part in electoral politics. Like the NC, the PDP too has blamed the atmosphere created in the Kashmir Valley in the wake of challenges to Article 35A in the Supreme Court. The PDP has declared that it will go to any extent to safeguard Article 35A, which allows the Jammu and Kashmir legislature to define permanent residents of the state. It must be said that debates around Article 35A have led to a rise in the political temperatures in the state. Opinions of people vary across regions of the state, with large parts of Jammu and Ladakh being opposed to Article 35A. In the Kashmir Valley, however, a near uniformity has been observed among various sections of the people. Even separatists, who declare time and again that they do not have any faith in the Constitution of India, are strenuously defending an Article inserted into it through a presidential order on 14 May, 1954. In the Ladakh region, voices in favour or against Article 35A are almost muted, with hardly any leader of some standing making clear his or her stand on the issue. One reason for it could be that Ladakh has remained comparatively aloof from whatever has happened in the past in Jammu or in Kashmir. The most important political demand of Ladakhis have been the grant of Union Territory (UT) status to the entire region. Ladakhis, as such, remain fairly non-committal about airing their views on Article 35A. It may be noted here that the last panchayat elections were held in 2011 and the term of the office-bearers had ended in mid-2016. The tenures of the ULBs in the state had lapsed much earlier and today, neither are there any panchayats nor are there ULBs in place. On the other hand, elections to the Lok Sabha seats in the state and to the State Legislative Assembly are being held regularly since 1996, over two decades ago. Think about it carefully. Elections to the state Legislative Assembly were held in 1996, in 2002, in 2008, and then in 2014, more or less on time regularly, at intervals of six years. Similarly, elections for the Lok Sabha constituencies have also been held on time, all this while after every five years. How is it that time and again, when the elections to ULBs or panchayats are to be organised, successive state governments cite the “vitiated atmosphere’’ as the reason for not holding them? These repeated excuses of the state governments for not holding elections to the grassroots democratic institutions were accepted readily by the central governments earlier. On the one hand, Jammu and Kashmir claims it is the most autonomous of all states of India, but on the other hand, its institutions seem most powerless. This is a strange paradox wherein the state governments deliberately deny all chances of grassroots democracy to flourish. In fact, if the elections to ULBs and panchayats are held, as scheduled, and these are empowered as per their mandates under 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, there will be a huge inflow of funds to Jammu and Kashmir. The legislators of the state have systematically denied these grassroots democratic institutions their rights. It appears that they believe that the empowerment of these institutions may devalue them. The funds to both ULBs and the panchayats will accrue from the Centre and not from the state government. The legislators of the state have needlessly been blocking empowerment of the ULBs and the panchayats.",2018-09-22,"Article 35a,BJP,Congress,Jammu And Kashmir,Jammu And Kashmir Panchayat Polls,NC,PDP,PoliticalPlay,Satya Pal Malik","Jammu and Kashmir legislators needlessly blocking local body polls, 'vitiated atmosphere' is a flimsy excuse",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/jammu-and-kashmir-legislators-needlessly-blocking-local-body-polls-vitiated-atmosphere-is-a-flimsy-excuse-5240741.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh Saturday accused the Congress of trying to mislead the people on the Vyapam issue. The saffron party alleged that the Opposition was scared of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's ""popularity"" and hence moved the court ahead of the state Assembly polls. The BJP's reaction came hours after a local court recorded the statement of Congress leader Digvijay Singh in connection with a private complaint filed against chief minister Chouhan, Union minister Uma Bharti and five others in the Vyapam scam. ""Congress doesn't believe in any investigating agency. They questioned the police investigation into the Vyapam case. Hence, the probe was handed over to the STF (special task force). But since it was not satisfied, a high court-monitored SIT investigated the charges,"" MP's Public Relations minister Narottam Mishra told reporters. ""The investigation was later handed over to the CBI, but the Congress is still not satisfied,"" he said. Mishra said although the CBI did not find any tampering with the electronic evidence in the Vyapam case, the Congress continued to mislead on the issue. Raising a question mark over the timing of Digvijay Singh's petition in the local court, Mishra said, ""Instead of going to the public, the Congress moved the court ahead of the state Assembly elections to mislead the people."" ""The case was discussed in the local court, the high court as well as the apex court, yet the Congress leaders did not produce the evidence. Now, they have moved the court ahead of the election,"" he said. In his plea filed in the local court, Digvijay Singh has sought criminal prosecution of Chouhan, Bharti and five others in the Vyapam scam. ""Digvijay Singh has submitted an electronic evidence copy that states the name of Chouhan 48 times in a Vyapam scam investigation document,"" Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who appeared as Digvijay's lawyer, told reporters after appearing in the court in the afternoon. He alleged that earlier the STF and now the CBI were trying to shield people, especially Chouhan, in the Vyapam scam. Sibal alleged that Chouhan was the root of the scam. ""With Digvijay Singh's private complaint, we are going to prove Chouhan's involvement in the scam,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,"BJP president Amit Shah on Friday asked Congress chief Rahul Gandhi if he supported ""Urban Naxals"" plotting to assassinate the prime minister and demanded he clarifies his stand on the issue to people in poll-bound Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Shah's comments come in the wake of the Maharashtra police arresting five human rights activists late last month for their alleged links with Maoists. ""The BJP government in Maharashtra recently arrested urban Maoists. Questions were raised about their arrest as they have the right to speak. Shouldn't those possessing mortar (guns) and plotting to assassinate the prime minister be arrested?"" Shah asked. He asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi if he supported those who ""wanted to break the country"". ""The Congress president should make clear his party's stand on the Maoist issue in the poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan,"" Shah, addressing a gathering of party workers, said.

The BJP chief also lauded the efforts of Chief Minister Raman Singh's government for eliminating the menace of naxalism from Chhattisgarh. Speaking about the publication of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, Shah said the BJP will ensure that no illegal infiltrator stays in the country. ""The National Register of Citizens was implemented and prima facie as many as 40 lakh people were identified as illegal immigrants in Assam,"" he said. ""Suddenly they (Congress) started showing concern for human rights of infiltrators,"" he added. ""Rahul Gandhi should answer (why) he can speak of human rights of infiltrators but can not speak about human rights of people who suffer due to illegal immigrants,"" Shah said. ""He can not see human rights of people killed in bomb blasts. He should think of human rights of the youths of the country instead of that of infiltrators,"" he added. ""Rahul Gandhi, do whatever you want to do, but in 2019, the BJP will not allow any infiltrator to stay in the country after it again storms to power... It is our resolution,"" the BJP chief said. ""When the Jan Sangh was formed, it had only 10 members but now it (the BJP) has around 15 crore active members and the flag of the BJP is now flying over around 70 percent of the country,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,"Weeks ahead of the Assembly polls in Rajasthan, former Union minister Jaswant Singh's son and BJP MLA Manvendra Singh Saturday announced he has quit the party. “I will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from home,” he said, referring to the Barmer-Jaisalmer parliamentary constituency which in the past has been represented by his father. The MLA from Sheo said he has no plan to join the Congress as of now. “I am not in touch with any Congress leader,” he told reporters after addressing a public meeting at Pachpadra in Barmer, where some supporters raised pro-Congress slogans. He said he will meet his supporters and will take a decision based on what the people wanted. At the public meeting, dubbed 'swabhiman' (self-respect) rally, he had referred to the party's lotus symbol and said associating with it had been a “big mistake”. “Kamal ka phool, badi bhool,” he said. When contacted by   after the rally, the MLA said, “I am no longer in BJP.” Singh said the 'swabhiman' mision began in 2014 when his father Jaswant Singh was denied the party ticket in the Lok Sabha polls. He said Narendra Modi, now prime minister and the then Gujarat chief minister, had called him up saying he was not present at the meeting where that decision was taken. Manvendra Singh said Modi had then asked him to remain patient. “But the limit of my patience is now over” he said at the well-attended rally. He said those who had supported the family in 2014 had faced hardships, and this had now become an issue of self-respect. Singh said two people from Delhi and one from Jaipur were responsible for his father not getting the party's nomination in 2014. The MLA said he had told the prime minister and party chief Amit Shah about the situation in the state. He referred to the police encounters in which alleged criminals Anandpal and Chatur Singh were killed, leading to resentment in their Rajput community. Singh concluded his address by chanting, ‘Kamal ka phool, badi bhool.' His supporters shouted ‘Kamal ka phool, hamari bhool (picking Lotus, our mistake). His wife Chitra Singh called upon the people to vote out the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan the coming Assembly elections. A large number of his supporters from Marwar region were present at the meeting. After denial of the party nomination in 2014, Jaswant Singh contested the elections as an Independent candidate.

Sandip Ghose,"  *** Three months ago, most die-hard BJP supporter would not put money on the party’s return in Rajasthan. Not with Vasundhara Raje as the chief ministerial candidate for sure. But, if one asks now, many would say it is a 50:50 game that could go either way in the coming months. So, has anything changed? I drove to Alwar from Delhi. The first stop was Bhiwadi, an industrial town across the Haryana border. Locals credit Bhairon Singh Shekhawat’s vision for this manufacturing hub. In coming years, it may well become an extension of Gurgaon-NCR. Little did I expect to get caught in a traffic jam in Bhiwadi. But, there I was sitting in the midst of “Jagran” procession. This was outside one of the many temples in the city run by the Gujjar Samaj. The Gujjars came to Bhiwadi after reaping a fortune, when land prices soared in Haryana. Now they are the dominant set in the area. And, Sachin Pilot is a Gujjar, informed my driver. Thus at Alwar, I expected to find a resounding endorsement for Pilot. Instead, the traders I met were rather circumspect. Pilot may draw the Gujjar votes, but he may not be able to reign in its rowdy elements. That might make the others wary. Here, lies the importance of Ashok Gehlot. Pilot is the darling of the national media. But, Gehlot remains the favourite face of Congress in Rajasthan. In recent times, no other Congress leader in the state has commanded as much respect as Gehlot. In a world where corruption is a relative term, Gehlot enjoys a clean image. People rate his last term well. They admire his administrative acumen and people connect. Gehlot fans think, had it not been for the “Modi Wave” of 2014, he would have definitely come back for a second inning. In recent months, Gehlot’s stock has risen further in Rajasthan. He gets the credit for Rahul Gandhi’s second coming as it were, starting with the Gujarat elections. People believe, he is the brain behind Rahul’s temple run and “Shiv-Bhakt” makeover. They feel as a member of Rahul's inner coterie, he will play a much bigger role in the days to come. Pilot has been working hard at a micro-level ever since he took charge of the state unit. Congress' good showing in some of the local elections and by-polls are the result of his efforts. But, he has still not acquired the stature to stake a claim the top job on his own steam. Apart from Gehlot, CP Joshi is far from hanging his boots. Joshi shows no intention of fading into the sunset yet. He still wields enough clout to influence the ticket distribution. Pilot will have to contend with all these forces. Only Rahul’s endorsement cannot see him through. He will need Gehlot’s blessings to advance further. It is doubtful if Gehlot will relinquish his turf so early. Knowing the Congress, it is unlikely to spell out its chief ministerial choice before the elections. Rahul is no Narendra Modi that he can sweep state election on his own equity without a strong local face. To take on Vasundhara, naming Gehlot as the chief ministerial candidate would be the best option for Rahul. But, will he be able to spare him before the Lok Sabha polls? That is the dilemma, which should be troubling Rahul. The road to Jaipur via the Sariska Tiger Reserve is an orthopaedics delight. Because it is sure to cause a few spine dislocations daily. A stark contrast to the satin smooth Delhi-Jaipur Highway it merges into. Who can tell if these are symbolic of what lies ahead on the election trail? But, their hopes crashed at every turn. The last bet was Modi-Shah will project a second face as a chief minister probable in the run-up to the elections. But, Vasundhara put an end to all speculations. She checkmated Amit Shah’s nominee and installed her own candidate as the new state president of the BJP. The message was sharp and clear that she remains in control. Shah had little option but to declare that BJP will go to the polls with Vasundhara on the driver's seat. It would be naive to believe that Shah-Modi had to field Raje under duress. There is a lot going in her favour. First, the BJP has no other mass leader in Rajasthan. No other BJP leader, not even Om Mathur, has such universal acceptability across the state. Even a sharp-shooter like Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore would be an instant casualty of the internal crossfires of the party. It is well known that Raje commands the loyalty of over 120 odd MLAs. Through them, she has her own network across the state. Only she has the assured backing of the RSS ground force with her direct line to Nagpur. But, she is not one to rely only upon political manoeuvres to secure her position. She has followed structured and well-targeted welfare programmes. Schemes like BHAMASHA have won her huge support among women voters and mass connect. Vasundhara runs a tight party machinery. It would be even more formidable with RSS foot-soldiers. With various factions in the state Congress, Pilot may not enjoy the same unity of command. Like every other state even Vasundhara will have to depend on the Modi Magic to deliver the final goods. The balance will tilt decisively in BJP’s favour if the state and Lok Sabha polls are made to coincide, an option that cannot be ruled out as yet. But, as on date, no one can write Vasundhara off as some were prone to do a few months ago. The contest is still wide open. A local wit at the Jaipur Club Bar summed it up with a smart quip. Those who decide to vote for Congress will do so in the hope that, after the Lok Sabha elections Gehlot will come back as the chief minister. People voting for BJP will do so confident of Modi returning as prime minister. They will hope that Vasundhara having proved a point might then hand over the baton to a new face and move to a role at the Centre. No doubt the outcome in Rajasthan will also impact the Lok Sabha elections. But, the battle for the chief minister's chair in Jaipur will not be sealed till the new occupant of the throne in Delhi is decided.",2018-10-02,"Amit Shah,Ashok Gehlot,Bhairon Singh Shekhawat,BHAMASHA,Congress,CP Joshi,Gujjar,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Narendra Modi,OM Mathur,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,PoliticsOnTheGo,Rahul Gandhi,Rajasthan Assembly Election 2019,Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore,Sachin Pilot,Vasundhara Raje",Rajasthan polls: Vasundhara Raje grips state BJP; Sachin Pilot toils but Ashok Gehlot may be Congress' CM pick,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-polls-vasundhara-raje-firmly-grips-state-bjp-sachin-pilot-toils-but-ashok-gehlot-may-be-congress-cm-pick-5226541.html,firstpost,-1,0

Sanjay Singh,"When Mohan Bhagwat publicly repudiated RSS’ second and longest-serving chief MS Golwalkar’s radical Hindutva thoughts as contained in   during a two-hour long question-answer session on the concluding day of his three-day lecture series in New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan he was not making an off the cuff remark. He was stating a considered view, which has been in vogue within the Sangh Parivar for over a decade but had so far not been made public. The serving fountainhead of Sangh Parivar, Bhagwat thought it was time to let it be known to the wider world that the organisation has evolved beyond those thoughts and has not shied away in discarding ideas and philosophies which were not in sync with changing time. By doing so and by talking at length with clarity on all contentious issues — ranging from “remote control or phone call from Nagpur to Modi government”, position of women, Hindu, Hindutva, Hindu Rashtra, belief in Indian Constitution, position on national flag, dictatorial divisive organisation, Section 377, its position on Muslims and Christians, Ram Mandir and whole lot of other issues — the three-day lecture series by Bhagwat, the first of its kind in RSS’ 93-year-old history in a way succeeded in what it strived to achieve, to portray it as a liberal nationalist socio-cultural organisation, which was inclusive and not “divisive Hindu force”. But the biggest takeaway was his redefinition of what Hindu, Hindutva, Hindu Rashtra meant for them. To do so it was important that he clarified RSS’ position on Golwalkar’s contention. Consider what Bhagwat as the then Sarkayawah of RSS wrote in the foreword of the book,  : “Twelve volumes containing Sri Guruji speeches writings conversation and letters they have already been brought out. Naturally, they cover many subjects, some of them of contemporary relevance and some others of all time relevance. Time never stands still and circumstances do change. But thoughts of eternal values have relevance all through, they are ever sought for as and when occasions arise and in turn, they give right guidance providing right solutions. With this belief, a small team of capable hands joined together to gather such abiding thoughts of Sri Guruji from the aforesaid volumes and this anthology is the results.” The book was released in India and abroad in 2008 and was republished in October 2016. An RSS functionary told  , “What Bhagwatji said at Vigyan Bhawan was not new to us. This has been Sangh’s position for more than a decade but Sarsanghchalak saying something like at a public platform in front of this kind of an audience makes the difference.” But the problem for the RSS and the BJP or other saffron sympathisers was due to lack of any stated policy of RSS on this account, they couldn’t counter the critics and rivals charge against Golwalkar’s divisive ideas. Golwalkar who is popularly called as Guruji in Sangh Parivar circles is credited for the aggressive expansion of the organisation including allowing Swayamsewaks to branch out in various fields and work as its affiliates. But his radical thoughts about Hindus, democracy, Muslims, Hindu Rashtra as contained in his book   have often been embarrassing to the RSS and to the BJP. Critics, Left-liberals and ideological opponents would pick up a portion or two to run down the RSS. In the run-up to the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections, RJD leader Lalu Prasad would show the cover of that book to make charges against the RSS and BJP on the reservation to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class. Liberal historian  . In response to a pre-submitted question on Golwalkar’s   where Muslims are called the   (enemy), Bhagwat on Wednesday said:  “ …. (So far as   is concerned, every statement carries a context of time and circumstance…his enduring thoughts are in a popular edition in which we have removed all remarks that have a temporary context and retained those that will endure for ages. You won’t find that remark there. What is said in a certain given situation does not remain eternal. Sangh is not a closed institution. Time changes, our thoughts also change and we have permission from Dr Hedgewar to change.) On all three days, the RSS chief was consistent about the need to keep in sync with changing times. He was making a strong pitch to let people from cross sections of society, all caste and communities, as also political spectrum consider Sangh as an umbrella ideological tent where all could pick up something that they could think is good for them. From what he spoke and the way he spoke, it appeared that the Narendra Modi government’s catchphrase  was not written by any famed copywriter but was drawn from Sangh’s social philosophy. To a question why RSS sends its swayamsewaks only to the BJP and not to any other party, Bhagwat wittingly responded “because no other party requests us to send a swayamsewak for the post of general secretary of the organisation. Let that request come from any other party and we will consider.”",2018-09-20,"BJP,Hindu Rashtra,Hindutva,Mohan Bhagwat,MS Golwalkar,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,RSS,Sangh Parivar,Section 377",Mohan Bhagwat rejects MS Golwalkar's rigid Hindutva norms in quest to project RSS as a progressive organisation,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mohan-bhagwat-rejects-ms-golwalkars-rigid-hindutva-norms-in-quest-to-project-rss-as-a-progressive-organisation-5227611.html,firstpost,-1,0
Debobrat Ghose,"In a major setback to the Congress party, the Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by Congress leader KK Mishra related to the infamous dumper scam against Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as ‘withdrawn’. The apex court also observed orally that election should be fought outside the court and not in the courtroom. “The Supreme Court today dismissed the petition filed by KK Mishra as withdrawn. The Madhya Pradesh High Court on 29 January had dismissed the review petition on the ground that sanction from competent authority wasn’t obtained by the petitioner, as it was against the CM (Shivraj Singh Chouhan), who’s a public servant. The HC had also observed that a similar complaint was discussed earlier and after three years the petitioner (KK Mishra) again brought it. Therefore the SC today didn’t want to intervene with the HC order,” advocate Vanshaja Shukla, who appeared before the Supreme Court along with senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told  Rohatgi and Shukla represented Chouhan on Thursday during the hearing before the Supreme Court bench comprising Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan. “Justice Sikri observed orally to senior Congress leader and senior advocate Kapil Sibal that election is round the corner and they (Congress party) should fight election outside the court and not in the courtroom. It was not recorded but was in response to senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi’s plea that the said case is politically motivated,” said advocate Shukla. The alleged dumper scam against Chouhan is one of the major issues like the Vyapam scam that the Opposition Congress has been using as a weapon to attack the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh alleging corruption. Bhopal-based Congress leader and a lawyer by profession, Mishra had alleged that Chouhan after becoming the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh in November 2005, doled out favours to an industrial group -- Jaypee Associates in Rewa. He had moved court alleging that the chief minister misused his official position and rented out dumper trucks to the said group as quid pro quo for allocation of out-of-the-turn mining leases. The complainant had also alleged that four dumpers worth Rs 2 crore were registered in the name of Chouhan’s wife Sadhna Singh. In January this year, the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissed a review petition filed by Mishra, challenging Bhopal district court’s judgment (28 October 2017) that had dismissed his previous petition seeking reinvestigation into the alleged dumper scam. The ground of dismissal of review petition was the absence of sanction in the case. A sanction is required from a competent authority for the prosecution against a person holding public office (or a public servant). In the case of the chief minister, the competent authority is the governor. The alleged dumper scam snowballed into a major controversy in the state and Assembly proceedings were disrupted for days when the issue became public. The Opposition Congress in Madhya Pradesh that pursued the case for almost a decade, is up in arms against Shivraj Singh government and wants to use it as a ‘major case of corruption’ during its upcoming Assembly election campaign. Senior Congress leader and senior advocates Sibal, Vivek Tankha and others represented Mishra at the Supreme Court. “SC wasn’t inclined to hear the petition, as the apex court sought a sanction from the competent authority in this case. As the petition is against Madhya Pradesh chief minister, a sanction is needed. This only means more delay, as they (Madhya Pradesh chief minister and others) have gained two months and by then the Assembly election will take place. But we’ll continue with our fight against this scam,” senior advocate and Rajya Sabha member from Congress Tankha told  “I’m told that our senior leader Kapil Sibal , who’s also a senior advocate and representing this case along with Vivek Tankha  and others, withdrew the case on technical grounds. It has not been rejected. After discussion with our lawyers and leaders, we may file a fresh petition afresh,” said Mishra.",2018-09-20,"BJP,Congress,Dumper Scam,Jaypee Associates,KK Mishra,Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh Election 2018,Madhya Pradesh High Court,PoliticalPlay,Politics,Sadhna Singh,Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Supreme Court,Vivek Tankha,Vyapam Scam",Dumper scam: Jolt for Congress as Supreme Court dismisses petition against Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/dumper-scam-jolt-for-congress-as-supreme-court-dismisses-petition-against-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-5228001.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," Dealing a blow to the Congress' plans to sew up an alliance, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday announced 22 candidates for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections and said it will contest all 230 seats. The list includes three sitting MLAs. State Congress president Kamal Nath had said earlier that his party wants to join hands with like-minded parties such as the BSP for taking on the ruling BJP. Nath had also met BSP supremo Mayawati on 15 July. However, the BSP said Thursday that it will contest all 230 Assembly seats on its own in the state where elections are due by year-end. A Congress leader said on the condition of anonymity that his party still has hopes that an alliance with the BSP will materialise. ""They have announced only 22 candidates, including three sitting MLAs, for the seats where their position is strong. It is just a move to scare us and get a better seat sharing deal,"" he said.

Press Trust of India,"The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief K Chandrasekhar Rao will play an important role in national politics after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but would not ""leave"" the state, a key party leader said Friday. B Vinod Kumar, the deputy floor leader of TRS in the Lok Sabha, also said the caretaker chief minister, popularly known as KCR, would not hand over the reins to his son and minister KT Rama Rao after the Assembly elections. The Telangana Assembly was dissolved on 6 September on the recommendation of the TRS government, more than eight months before the expiry of its term, to pave the way for early elections. The Election Commission is yet to announce the poll schedule. ""KCR will play an important role in Indian politics after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections"", Vinod Kumar, who represents Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency, said. When asked about KCR's move to prop up a non-Congress, non-BJP federal front appearing to be not making much headway, he said: ""You see after the 2019 elections, the role of regional political parties will be very, very important."" On whether KCR would hand over reins to his son Rama Rao after the Assembly elections, as is being speculated in some quarters, Vinod Kumar said: ""No, not at all. KCR is fascinated by Telangana, he will not leave Telangana"". He dismissed criticism by the Opposition Congress and BJP that the TRS is a ""family party"", and also the move to get the state's first Assembly dissolved prematurely.

Press Trust of India," Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday described the conduct of Wednesday's zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls in the state as ""brutal and broad daylight murder of democracy."" He said ""the wanton lawlessness and criminality"" witnessed on Wednesday during the polls should finally open the eyes of those who thought that the SAD's fears of poll violence were just a ""ruse."" Badal said 19 September, 2018 will be remembered as ""one of the darkest days"" for democracy in Punjab when the Congress made the state ""look like Bihar"" during the latter's worst period. The former chief minister said it was ""extremely painful and regrettable"" that the state election commission completely abdicated its constitutional responsibility on Wednesday. ""Both the state machinery and the state election commission functioned as an extension of the Congress party during the entire poll process,"" he said in a statement in Chandigarh. Badal said not only the mammoth and unprecedented response of Punjabis to the SAD-BJP rally at Faridkot and earlier at Abohar, but also its strong Punjabi and Panthic character had unnerved the Congress and its stooges. ""For these stooges hiding behind Panthic cloaks, yesterday was repayment time for the favours they continue to receive from the Congress government. They carried out poll violence at the behest of the Congress which is keeping them politically afloat for its ultimate anti-Sikh agenda."" ""The Congress is providing political cover to the forces inimical to peace and communal harmony. As in the eighties, this nexus is pushing Punjab into the jaws of violence,"" he said. Badal said the SAD is their prime target because ""our party has always articulated the Sikh and Punjabi cause in a peaceful and democratic way."" ""Peace and democracy is at stake in Punjab. The non-performance of the state government and its betrayal to the people of Punjab on the promises made to them by Amarinder Singh by holding Gutka Sahib (religious book) in hand has completely isolated the Congress from the people,"" he said. The Congress now is using its old card of dividing Punjabis and conspiring to push the brave Sikh community into a fratricidal civil war, he said. Badal said the SAD is determined not only to expose the nexus and its conspiracies but also to save Punjab and the Sikhs from these evil designs. Meanwhile, SAD leaders in Chandigarh alleged the police helped Congress during the polls and sought the registration of a case against SSP Muktsar. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal will not file for anticipatory bail in the ""political vendetta case"" that was registered against him Wednesday, the SAD leaders said. Senior SAD leaders Bikram Singh Majithia, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Dr Daljit Singh Cheema alleged that the officer ""gave directions to the district police to help Congress workers capture booths as per the command of his political masters"".

Press Trust of India,": The Congress hit back at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, accusing him of ""lying"" on the issue of Non Performing Assets (NPAs) and dubbed him as a ""court jester"" writing ""wasteful"" blogs, after he called Rahul Gandhi a ""clown prince"" who was spreading ""lies"" about Modi government waiving Rs 2.5 lakh crore in loans to 15 industrialists. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Jaitley of making desperate attempts at spreading ""fake agenda to stay relevant as a court jester"" and asked why he was ""abusing"" the Opposition instead of answering the questions on NPAs of banks and Rafale deal. Attacking the government on the issue of NPAs, the Congress leader alleged collusion between ""bank looters and the Modi government"". ""Political amnesia and chest thumping cannot obliterate your dismal record of dismantling India's economic progress or as also the surging NPAs resulting out of bankruptcy of economic vision of Modi Government,"" he said. He said Jaitley and the Modi government have been ""trapped"" on the Rafale issue and that is why they are resorting to abuse the Opposition. ""Arun Jaitley is desperate in his attempt to stay relevant as a ‘court jester' to ‘Modi Sultanate'. 'Abuse, diversion' and deception' are the desperate tools of a 'Lying - '."" ""Instead of hiding behind the cloak of expletives for the opposition, let finance minister coherently answer politically relevant issues,"" he said in a statement. Surjewala said the Finance Ministry in a reply in Parliament on 24 July, 2018 admitted that NPAs stood at Rs 2,51,054 crore when Congress-UPA demitted power and they have increased to a whopping Rs 9,61,962 crore by March 2018. As NPAs now stand as Rs 12,00,000 crore, he asked, ""Are you lying in your ‘fake agenda blogpost' today or did you lie in Parliament? The nation wants to know"". ""We dare you to publicly state the amount of loans given during the tenure of Modi Government in last 52 months, along with details as to how much of those loans have become NPAs? How much worth of loans were ‘ever-greened' and ‘restructured' during the tenure of Modi Government?"" the Congress leader said. He also asked how many ‘willful defaulters' escaped from India during last 52 months and with how much money. ""How many ‘economic offenders', ‘defaulters' and ‘looters' did you bring back to India and jailed?"" he asked. ""And yes  , the desperate quest to stay relevant of a ‘court jester' by wasteful blogs continues."" ""Please reply - Why hide behind abuse when trapped in Rafale maze? Why supersede HAL for Rs 30,000 crore contract? Why no answer on Rs 41,000 crore loss in Rafale scam?"" he said on Twitter. Surjewala also asked why was ‘Offset Contract' of Rs 30,000 crore given to a 12-day-old company and why a purchase of Rs 526 crore Rafale was made for Rs 1,670 crore and caused a loss of Rs 41,205 crore to the country. ""Why compromise national security by reducing aircraft from 126 to 36? Why did you violate the Defence Procurement Procedure? Why was no prior approval taken from Cabinet Committee on Security? Why did you sacrifice 'Transfer of Technology' to India? Why eight-year long delay for 'emergency purchase' of aircraft?"" he asked. Raising the Vijay Mallya issue, Surjewala asked, ""Did Mallya, an economic offender of Rs 9,091 crore, meet you on March 1, 2016 and tell you he was leaving India for London? Did Mallya not run away on 2 March, 2016?"" ""Were you not duty bound as Finance Minister to alarm the authorities and get Mallya arrested? Should your role then be not probed? Do you have any right to continue as Finance Minister? Should you not be sacked immediately?"" He said the truth is that the “ever depreciating ‘Rupee', the ever increasing fuel prices, the declining exports and extinguished savings, the phenomenally high current account deficit is your sad legacy and making the common people of India describe you as – 'Jaitley looted the pockets'.""

Press Trust of India," Congress legislators in Goa on Tuesday met Governor Mridula Sinha and demanded a floor test by the BJP-led government to prove its majority in the Assembly. The move by the Opposition Congress, which has staked claim to form an alternate government, came at a time when 62-year-old Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar is admitted in the AIIMS in Delhi for a pancreatic ailment. The Congress legislators, led by Leader of Opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar, demanded that the governor should summon one-day session of the Assembly for a floor test. Kavlekar said the governor assured them that she would get back on the issue in the next three-four days. During the meeting with the governor, the Congress MLAs contended that the Parrikar-led coalition falls short of a majority in the 40-member Assembly and that the Congress has the required numbers to form the government. ""Let the state government prove on the floor that they have majority or else we can show that we have more legislators than them,"" Kavlekar told reporters after meeting Sinha. The Congress has 16 seats in the Assembly. The state is being ruled by the BJP with the support of Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), NCP and Independents. The BJP has 14 seats in the Assembly, GFP and MGP have three each and NCP has one. There are also three Independents. In Delhi, Defence Minister and senior BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman said the Congress move reflected the level of desperation to grab power. ""The chief minister is ill. He is not staying away from work otherwise. The Congress sees a chance as the CM is ill. It just shows what is the level of desperation (of Congress). Honestly, I feel sad for it,"" she said at a media interaction. The Congress legislators also urged the governor not to allow dissolution of the Assembly. Kavlekar said the BJP might force dissolution of the Assembly and another election in just one-and-a-half year. The Assembly polls in the state were held in February last year. ""The BJP has a habit of recommending dissolution of the House when they dont have numbers with them. The governor should not allow such action in Goa as Congress is the single largest party in the House,"" Kavlekar said. ""We dont want another election within one-and-a-half years,"" the Congress leader added. ""If the (BJP-led) coalition can't run the government, then we are ready to take over,"" he said. Kavlekar said a ""race has begun within the government for chief ministership"" as Parrikar is hospitalised. ""Some of the BJP leaders are in touch with us as they are upset because their own party is talking about hiring the leaders from outside for CM's post,"" he claimed. Kavlekar said the Congress will announce its chief ministerial candidate when the governor summons one-day session of the Assembly to conduct a floor test. ""There is absolutely no dispute amongst us on who would be the chief minister. We will reveal the name when floor test is called,"" he said. Congress Legislature Party had on Monday submitted a memorandum to the governor's office on Monday but could not meet the governor as she was out of station. BJP leader Ram Lal, who along with two other leaders, had been deputed by the central leadership in Panaji to take stock of the political situation, had said on Monday that the Goa government is stable and no demand has been made for a change in the leadership. He stated this after a meeting with party MLAs, former legislators and core committee members. He said the BJP's alliance partners — the Goa Forward Party (GFP), the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and Independents — conveyed that they will agree to any political decision taken by the saffron party. Earlier too, the Congress had staked claim on 18 May, 2018 to form the government in Goa, citing the example of Karnataka where the largest party BJP was invited to form the government after the Assembly polls threw up a fractured verdict. The Congress had said that it had not been invited to form the government in Goa after the Assembly polls in March last year despite it emerging as the largest single party. The party had also met Governor on 7 September, 2018 urging her to intervene as State Administration was suffering due to sickness of the chief minister.",2018-09-18,"AIIMS,BJP,Congress,Floor Test,Goa,India,Manohar Parrikar,Mridula Sinha,NewsTracker,Politics","Congress legislators in Goa meet governor, demand floor test; BJP says this reflects party's desperation",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-legislators-in-goa-meet-governor-demand-floor-test-bjp-says-this-reflects-partys-desperation-5210541.html,firstpost,-1,0
Saurabh Sharma," Self-proclaimed Hindu nationalist Amit Jani is in the news yet again: This time for  , the man accused of burning and killing a Muslim man in Rajasthan last December. A video of the alleged hate crime through which the police identified Regar went viral on social media. Jani, the chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Navnirman Sena, a local political outfit, claimed Regar has accepted his offer to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Agra. Jani said his party will contest on the issue of Hindutva in five constituencies across Uttar Pradesh: Agra, Aligarh, Noida, Mathura and Firozabad. Asked about how he came to such an idea, Jani said during a trip to Rajasthan, he met people who supported Regar and lauded his effort to “save Hindutva”. “The people of Rajasthan want the BJP to offer Regar a ticket in the upcoming polls, but the Vasundhara Raje government likes people such as Yunus Khan, who hesitate to chant Bharat  ,” said Jani. “We approached Regar to fight the elections and he accepted our offer.” The party offered Regar a ticket from Agra as they could not afford to contest elections from Rajasthan, Jani added. He further said that charges against Regar have not been proved in court, and Regar would not be given a ticket if they were proven. As per the constitutional amendments to the Representation of People (RP) Act, 2013, unless an individual is convicted of a crime, they are free to contest elections. Even convicts can contest elections six years after having served their jail term, according to the Act. Senior lawyer Ramanand Pandey, who practices in the Allahabad High Court, said contesting elections is an individual's constitutional right. “Regar can contest the election because he has not been convicted by a court,” Pandey said. Jani said he met Regar once in jail, and is regularly in touch with his family. Jani defended himself by saying that if persons such as Mukhtar Ansari (who was charged with murder and acquitted), and Atiq Ahmad (a murder accused) can become lawmakers, then why not someone like Regar? “Since Regar is in jail, his brother and wife will campaign for him,” Jani said, and added that the campaign would begin once Regar files his nomination.  “We are making arrangements for the family to stay and campaign for Regar and get as many votes as possible for him,” said Jani. Regar's family remained unavailable for comment and their home in Rajasthan's Rajsamand is locked. The Navnirman Sena will reveal more at a press conference in Agra on 19 September. Jani claimed there is a threat to Regar’s life in jail. “He released a video from jail where he said that his life was in danger and a man from a specific community was sent to his cell without his consent and that made him uncomfortable,” Jani alleged. Offering Regar the Lok Sabha seat is also an attempt to save the life of someone who saved his own religion, Jani claimed. When an accused in the and a   can be killed inside jail, then who is Shambhulal Regar? Jani asked. Jani revealed that he is in talks with other nationalist and Hindutva outfits in Uttar Pradesh to form a front to deal with ""anti-national"" and ""anti-Hindutva"" forces with non-violence. A decision regarding the formation of this group will be taken soon as their first priority is to start campaigning for Regar, Jani said. A former close aide of Jani—from when he was with the Samajwadi Party—speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Jani has ‘only money and power in mind’. “He is not associated with any ideology or party,” the ex-aide said.  “His stunts are always in favour of the ruling party, in a bid to catch the attention of the party chief or chief minister. He was earlier praising Akhilesh Yadav and with this he is now trying to get the attention of Yogi Adityanath.” He added, “Jani is a clever man. He knows how to stay in the headlines.” BJP Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said, “Regar is doing this to remain in the news. If someone is giving ticket to a person accused of murder, then it shows that the person offering the ticket has a criminal mindset as well. He is trying to gain the media’s attention by commenting on people like Yogi Adityanath.”",2018-09-18,"2019 Lok Sabha Elections,Agra,Amit Jani,BJP,Hindutva,Jodhpur Jail,Kanhaiya Kumar,Mohd Afrazul,National Commission Of Scheduled Castes,NewsTracker,Rajasthan,Rajsamand,Ramshankar Katheria,Shambhulal Regar,Taj Mahal,Uttar Pradesh Navnirman Sena",'Saving someone who saved his religion': Hindu nationalist on why he's offering Shambhulal Regar a ticket in 2019,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/saving-someone-who-saved-his-religion-hindu-nationalist-on-why-hes-offering-shambulal-regar-a-ticket-in-2019-5210481.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday said it was doubtful whether the Congress leader knows when rabi and kharif crops are grown and alleged the Opposition party cannot protect farmers' interest. Addressing farmers at a function in Nagaur district of poll-bound Rajasthan, Shah also said the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi do not give slogans merely for elections and they know how to make them a reality. He lauded Rajasthan for playing an important role in formation of the Modi government at the Centre with a huge majority. The BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats from the state in the 2014 general elections. Hailing the Rajasthan voters for giving a full majority to the BJP, Shah said there could have been a "" "" (weak government) if Rajasthan had not given such a verdict. The BJP president alleged the Congress can neither protect the country nor its farmers as it has failed to implement the slogan of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan'. Asking farmers to vote for the BJP, Shah said the BJP governments in the state and at the Centre have worked hard for the agriculture sector and were committed to meet the target of doubling farmers' income by 2022. He said the Modi government has worked for farmers ever since it came to power and has taken many decisions, including launch of soil health card, increase of minimum support price for rabi and kharif crops, lowering area covered for calculating compensation of damage to crops from 50 to 33 percent, and neem-coating of urea. ""To stand with farmers is the nature of the BJP. The BJP government is dedicated to farmers and has worked for them. We want to double farmers' income by 2022 when the country completes 75 years of independence. Only BJP can do this,"" he said. Targeting Gandhi, he said that it was doubtful that the Congress leader knows when rabi crops or kharif crops are grown, referring to the two main crop seasons in the country based on the monsoon. Shah has been touring different places in Rajasthan where Assembly elections are scheduled to take place later this year. Referring to the forthcoming elections, Shah said the Congress would contest the state polls in Sachin Pilot's leadership and asked farmers whether the Congress leader or anyone else can do any good for them. The BJP president said the Modi government has spent more budget on agriculture sector as compared to the former UPA government and the growth rate in agriculture sector in BJP-ruled states was high than that of the Congress-rule states. Shah also targeted the Congress over the issue of national security, saying when soldiers were beheaded on borders, the then PM Manmohan Singh was mute but Prime Minister Narendra Modi replied with a 'surgical strike' when Uri attack in Jammu & Kashmir happened during his rule. In Udaipur, he said the BJP has always taken care of tribals and that it was the Atal Bihari-led BJP government which set up a separate tribal affairs ministry. He said that the Modi government also took several decisions for the welfare of tribal people. Shah also visited Narayana Seva Sansthan, an NGO working for differently abled people, in Udaipur. He inaugurated a free surgery camp for 501 polio-affected children in the Sansthan. The BJP chief, during his three-day visit which concluded Tuesday, focused on farmers, youths, OBCs and tribal people and their issues. Shah visited Pali, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Bhilwara and Udaipur districts and party workers from three divisions of Jodhpur, Ajmer and Udaipur attended Shakti Sammelans and other programmes held during the party president's visit that began on Sunday.

Press Trust of India," AAP's Haryana unit chief Naveen Jaihind Tuesday provoked a controversy over the alleged gangrape of a girl in the state, saying he will give Rs 20 lakh to any BJP leader who gets sexually assaulted by 10 people. Jaihind, the husband of Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal, made the remarks while condemning the BJP government in Haryana for giving only Rs 2 lakh as compensation to the Rewari gang rape victim. The Aam Aadmi Party leader alleged that BJP government in the state has completely failed on the law and order and women safety front. The 19-year-old rape victim's family had Saturday decided to return a cheque of Rs 2 lakh handed over to them by officials under the Haryana Victim Compensation Scheme, 2013. ""Is a woman's honours worth Rs 2 lakh?"" Jaihind told reporters in Rohtak. ""Be ashamed, chief minister 'sahab'."" ""We will give Rs 20 lakh to any BJP leader who gets raped by 10 people. Does woman's honour have a value? ( ),"" he said. When contacted, the AAP leader said he stands by his comments. ""I stand by what I have said. You cannot disrespect any woman in society. The victim or her family are not asking for money, all they want is justice,"" he said over the phone. He said the gang rape incident was very unfortunate. ""But what happened in this case. The victim is made to run from pillar to post to get her complaint registered. Instead of acting against the culprits, the victim is harassed. While the family is demanding justice, you are handing them a cheque of Rs 2 lakh, which they don't want. Isn't it like rubbing salt on their wounds?"" Jaihind asked. ""So many crimes against women are taking place in Haryana, but the chief minister has become a 'Dhritarashtra'. The government has completely failed. It is like the Kauravas are ruling the state,"" he said. Activists lashed out at Jaihind for making the ""insensitive"" remarks. Women rights activist Shabnam Hashmi said the comments were ""very obnoxious and irresponsible"". ""This shows the patriarchal mindset of these leaders who consider women an object,"" she said. Annie Raja, National Federation of Indian Women's general secretary, said it is a ""criminal opinion"". ""He is trying to take political mileage out of the situation. These people do not consider women equal beings. After a few days, they apologise and escape by making such statements,"" she said. The 19-year-old woman, a Class 12 topper from Rewari, was abducted from a bus stop in Mahendragarh district Wednesday. She was allegedly drugged and gang raped in an agricultural field, police had said. Police have arrested three persons, including one of the prime accused, in connection with the incident.

Press Trust of India," Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was likely to meet top leaders of the BJP during his ongoing visit of New Delhi and thrash out the issue of seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls, his close aide said here on Tuesday. ""When our leader is in New Delhi, he would naturally meet leaders of our alliance partner. Moreover, I have said earlier that talks on seat-sharing are in final stages"", JD(U) national general secretary RCP Singh told reporters. He was replying to a query as to whether Kumar, who is also the JD(U) national president, was likely to meet BJP top brass and finalise sharing of seats during his tour of the national capital for a medical check-up. The chief minister, who had made a dash to New Delhi on Monday, was on Tuesday admitted to AIIMS this morning with complaints of fever and problems in eyes and knees. Singh, who is also the JD(U)'s leader in the Rajya Sabha, took a swipe at the opposition ""Mahagathbandhan"" with the sarcastic remark "" our full sympathy is with Hindustani Awam Morcha leader Jitan Ram Manjhi who has sought to contest 20 out of 40 seats in the state. After all, he is a former chief minister"". Manjhi had made a statement to the effect on Sunday. However, his party on Monday had clarified that he was only expressing that the HAM was ""ready"" to contest 20 seats and there was no demand for a specific number of seats.

Press Trust of India," Seeking to step up its attack on the Narendra Modi government over the Rafale deal, the Congress will raise the issue with the CAG on Wednesday and demand a thorough probe into the matter, party sources said. They said top Congress leaders will meet the Comptroller and Auditor General Wednesday morning on the issue. The Congress has alleged corruption in the deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France's Dassault Aviation. It has alleged that the Modi government has caused a loss of over Rs 41,000 crore to the exchequer by paying a higher price for the aircraft than what was negotiated by the UPA.

Press Trust of India,": Protesting the manner in which the Odisha Assembly passed a resolution, Opposition Congress and BJP Tuesday boycotted the House and refused to return despite several requests by Speaker PK Amat. ""We are boycotting the House to protest the manner which the House passed a resolution without paying scant respect towards Opposition,"" Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra of Congress said before leaving the House. The BJP members also followed and refused to return to the House even as two senior ministers and the government chief whip on behalf of the Speaker requested them to participate in the proceeding. As the Opposition members continued to remain away from the House, Speaker Amat adjourned the House twice for 15 minutes each. When they did not return, Speaker moved to the next business and asked Water Resources minister Niranjan Pujari to move Amendment to the Odisha Ground Water (Regulation, Development and Management) Bill, 2011. The dispute began when the House was discussing the resolution titled: ""This Assembly resolves to recommend the state government to move the Central government to include the 'Uniquely' Indian ideal of Ahimsa, of Non-Violence in the Preamble of India's Constitution.""

Press Trust of India,": The Opposition Congress in Goa on Wednesday claimed that it had the support of over 21 legislators in the 40-member Assembly, giving it enough strength to form the government in the state. The Congress, which is the single-largest party with 16 MLAs, has already staked claim to form the government in the coastal state. The Opposition party's claim comes at a time when Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar (62) is admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for a pancreatic ailment. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Chandrakant Kavlekar told   that the Congress had enough support to form the government in Goa. ""We have the required numbers. I am not going to tell you whom we are in discussions with, but we need the support of 21 MLAs and we have more than that,"" he said. The Congress legislators, led by Kavlekar, had met Governor Mridula Sinha on Tuesday and demanded a floor test by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government to prove its majority in the Assembly. Kavlekar said his party was waiting for a response from the governor, who had assured them that she would get back on the issue in three-four days. The state is being ruled by the BJP with the support of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Independent MLAs. The BJP has 14 seats in the Assembly, the GFP and the MGP have three each and the NCP has one. There are also three Independent legislators. Kavlekar claimed the political situation in the state was in the favour of the Congress as there was a lot of ""discontent"" among the ruling coalition partners. ""You have seen how the BJP observers came to Goa and met their legislators, former MLAs and alliance partners. They are also talking about inviting a leader from one of the allies to head the government. ""This has created a bitter situation as allowing one alliance partner to head the coalition will upset another,"" he said. Kavlekar also claimed that a section within the BJP was upset over the possibility of a leader being ""imported"" from outside and was in touch with the Congress for joining the opposition party. ""We need not go to anyone with the proposal of supporting or joining us. In fact, they are coming to us with proposals,"" he added.

Debobrat Ghose,"The full impact of losing elections in state after state in the past few years, including the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, is now visible on the Congress party’s coffers. Once the largest party of the country, Congress is now facing an embarrassing fund crunch in a crucial election year -- to the extent that it is going public with a nationwide fundraising programme. Named as ‘Mission Rs 500 crore’, the cash-starved Congress will kick-start the programme on 2 October, when the nation will engage in a two-year-long celebration across the country and all over the globe to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The newly appointed treasurer of Congress, Ahmed Patel has instructed the state and district units of the party along with the frontal organisations to get actively into the mass campaign for fund collection from 2 October. The campaign will conclude on the birth anniversary of former prime minister Indira Gandhi on 19 November. “A decision was taken in a meeting a fortnight ago to raise funds for the party ahead of elections. It’s for the first time that the Congress is going public for funds on such a large scale. The reason is obviously the shortage of funds in the party to contest elections this year, including the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Our party treasurer Ahmed Patel has communicated it to all committees in the states, districts, frontal organisations and various departments and cells of the Congress party,” a senior Congress leader told  . “Besides reaching out for funds, the Congress party workers will visit every booth and discuss with the public state and national issues ahead of elections,” the senior leader said. Keeping forthcoming elections in mind, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Ashok Gehlot in an official communique to AICC, PCC, DCC, frontal organisations, departments and cells of the party on 1 September had asked the heads and top office bearers of respective bodies for a detailed action plan in order to formulate a strategy at national level. Sourcing and utilisation of funds were two of the key areas of discussion in the follow-up meeting. According to a Congress MLA from Madhya Pradesh, who didn’t want to be named, the fund crunch in the party has been due to the electoral losses it faced over the years. The Congress faced a major loss in 2014 Lok Sabha election and consecutive state Assembly elections. “Besides the annual membership fee which is a minuscule amount, the MPs and MLAs also contribute funds to the party. It has declined drastically. The donations and corporate contribution have also reduced in comparison to the past. Contributors would like to go with the party in power like BJP, which is financially in a much stronger position. Now we’ll go to the public with issues and try to win back the trust they had in Congress earlier,” the MLA said. An internal report of the party highlighted that Congress would need Rs 1,000 crore for election campaigning along with other expenses during the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram by the year-end. Besides Assembly elections this year, Congress shall have to engage in a nationwide campaign ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha election, which requires major funding. A decline in donations, especially from corporate houses after 2014, has added to the woes. According to a report of the Association of Democratic Reforms and National Election Watch on donations received (above Rs 20,000) by national political parties in FY 2016-17, Congress received a much lesser amount than the BJP. While the BJP in FY 2016-17 received Rs 532.27 crore, the Congress got Rs 41.90 crore. The report further mentioned that in comparison to FY 2015-16, there was a rise of 593 percent in donations received by the BJP in FY 2016-17, whereas Congress received 105 percent more amount. BJP received Rs 76.85 crore and Congress Rs 20.42 crore in 2015-16. As donations from business houses while the BJP got Rs 515.43 crore in 2016-17, the Congress received Rs 36.06 crore. The Congress party has been facing the heat of fund crunch for quite some time. One may recall, the party’s general secretary and Madhya Pradesh in-charge, Deepak Babaria, had created a flutter within the party by suggesting an application fee for candidates for the Assembly election in the state to be held later this year. In a meeting with party workers in Jabalpur in February this year, Babaria said that contestants seeking a ticket should deposit Rs 50,000 as an application fee. This would be deposited in the party fund and will be used for campaigning. With an aim to collect Rs 500 crore, the party has fixed a minimum target for each booth committee at Rs 5,000. There are a total of 10 lakh booths. It has been decided by the party that Congress workers will visit every booth and discuss with the public on the state and national issues, besides taking donations. A door-to-door collection by booth workers will also be carried out with anyone contributing any amount from Rs 5 onwards. The party hopes that besides bringing some respite to its stressed coffers, the exercise will also strengthen grassroots connectivity of the party. “We’ve already started   campaign along with membership drive named  across the country. We’re doing small programmes to connect with the youth and engage in discussions on state and national issues. Besides the support from the party, we’ll get our resources,” president of Indian Youth Congress, Keshav Chand Yadav said.",2018-09-19,"Ahmed Patel,Ashok Gehlot,BJP,Congress,Mission Rs 500 Crore,PoliticalPlay,Politics,Rahul Gandhi","Depleting cash, falling popularity put Congress on a nationwide door-to-door campaign for money and support ahead of key polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/depleting-cash-falling-popularity-put-congress-on-a-nationwide-door-to-door-campaign-for-money-and-support-ahead-of-key-polls-5214891.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The BJP on Monday described the government's decision to bring an ordinance to make the practice of instant triple talaq a penal offence as a huge step towards ""empowering women"". Taking a dig at the Congress, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said Kapil Sibal, a leader of the Opposition party, defended this practice in the Supreme Court. For all these years, the Congress politicised the triple talaq issue for vote-bank politics. The Congress should be ashamed of itself, Patra said at a press conference at the party office in Delhi. The BJP thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing the triple talaq ordinance. It is a huge feat and huge step towards empowering women, Patra said. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared an ordinance to make the practice of instant triple talaq a penal offence. Briefing the media about the Cabinet decision, Law Minister   accused the Congress party of not cooperating in the passage of the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill, pending in the Rajya Sabha, because of vote-bank politics. The Supreme Court last year banned the practice. But since the practice was still prevalent, a bill was brought to make it a penal offence.",2018-09-19,"BJP,Cabinet,Congress,Kapil Sibal,NewsTracker,Sambit Patra,Supreme Court,Triple Talaq,Triple Talaq Ordinance,Women's Empowerment","BJP says triple talaq ordinance huge step towards women's empowerment, claims Congress 'politicised' issue",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjp-says-triple-talaq-ordinance-huge-step-towards-womens-empowerment-claims-congress-politicised-issue-5215761.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi government on Wednesday gave nod to an ordinance to ban triple talaq. This means that in the next few days, after receiving presidential assent and issuance of the notification, it will become the law of the land but will have to be ratified by both Houses of Parliament in the Winter Session. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, popularly called as the Triple Talaq bill was passed by Lok Sabha but has been pending in Rajya Sabha since January this year due to opposition from Congress and its allies. The bill also couldn’t be taken up in this year’s budget and Monsoon session. The criminalisation of  or triple talaq has a significant amount of political connotations apart from social ones as many BJP-ruled states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are going for polls later this year besides Telangana and Mizoram which are not BJP-ruled. The Lok Sabha polls are also due in the first half of next year. Although Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made it amply clear that the proposed law was about “gender justice and gender equity” among Muslim women, the underlying political message was unmissable. While talking about the need for an ordinance, Prasad kept on repeating how the Congress has consistently plotted to stall the bill in Rajya Sabha. He even mentioned about his and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar’s meetings with Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and his deputy in Congress party in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma. In a clear reference to Sonia Gandhi, Prasad said that despite ""a distinguished woman"" being at the helm of the Congress until recently, the bill to prevent suppression of Muslim women couldn’t get the party's support because of vote bank considerations. The minister's appeal to women leaders of the Opposition like Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee to come forward and support the bill in Rajya Sabha, where it will now be tabled in the Winter Session, also has a political implication apart from gender considerations. The Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party and Trinamool Congress collectively have 67 MPs in the Upper House and heavily bank on the Muslim community to win elections. It appears that womenfolk in the Muslim community are largely in favour of the triple talaq bill but most men in the community, as also the religious leaders of the community, are stridently opposed to the bill, particularly because of the penal provisions in the bill. The Congress’ objections to the bill, which have proved to be stalling or delaying tactic, are same as that of All India Muslim Personal Board (AIMPLB) and other community leaders. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal had represented Muslim AIMPLB in Supreme Court, an organisation which supports the continuance of triple talaq. The BJP used Sibal’s contention in the Supreme Court as an electoral issue against Congress in the Gujarat elections which the saffron entity won. The triple talaq bill has put the Congress, Samajwadi Party, BSP, TMC, Rashtriya Janata Dal and such other like-minded parties in a catch-22 situation. If they support the ordinance and its prospective passage in the Parliament they might end up antagonising the maulanas and the menfolk in the community and if they oppose it they might end up pushing the womenfolk in the community to support Narendra Modi and the BJP. At a public rally in Azamgarh in July this year,  , ""The real face of these parties was revealed by their approach on triple talaq… On one side, the Centre is making efforts to ease and improve the lives of women and on the other hand, these parties are working to put the lives of women, especially Muslim women, in danger…Crores of Muslim women had always demanded that triple talaq should be banned, as it is also banned in Islamic countries. I read in the newspaper that the Congress president had said that the Congress is a party of Muslims…But I want to ask the Congress whether it is a party of Muslim men alone."" The BJP has built a smart public narrative around this issue. The fact that triple talaq has either been banned or has been regulated in 22 Islamic countries is only helping the ruling BJP to make its arguments more convincing. The Modi government claims that there was “compelling necessity” and a great deal of “urgency” to bring an ordinance because the practice of triple talaq continues even after Supreme Court in August 2017 declared triple talaq as illegal. Since January 2017 till the current month, 430 triple talaq cases have been reported, 229 before the Supreme Court verdict and 201 after that. The government has made three crucial amendments in the original bill – first, the offence will be cognisable only when a complaint is filed by the wife, a relative by blood or by marriage; second, it was compoundable at the instance of wife on appropriate terms and conditions; third, magistrate will have powers to give bail after hearing the wife because this was a private dispute between husband and wife. Although the Congress is not convinced by the amendments, as it stands today, in the politics of triple talaq, the BJP has placed itself in an advantageous position.",2018-09-20,"AIMPLB,All India Muslim Personal Board,Congress,Crime Against Women,Kapil Sibal,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Triple Talaq",Triple talaq ordinance: BJP's decision means Congress-led Opposition could face Muslim community's ire,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/triple-talaq-ordinance-bjps-decision-means-congress-led-opposition-could-face-muslim-communitys-ire-5217931.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India," In a tit-for-tat attack, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Tuesday questioned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for winning 96 per cent of seats uncontested in the by-elections to three-tier panchayat polls in Tripura. The Mamata Banerjee-led party's attack comes after the BJP had mocked the TMC for winning over 30 percent of local bodies seats unchallenged in West Bengal recently. The ruling BJP has won around 96 percent of the over 3,000 seats in gram panchayats, panchayat samitis and zilla parishads without contest in the by-elections of three-tier panchayat polls in Tripura scheduled to be held on 30 September. ""Why is the BJP silent about its victory? When we had won seats uncontested they had moved court accusing us of unleashing violence, but now they too have won seats uncontested. What would they say now?"" asked State Minister and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim said. TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said, ""Those who live in glass house should not throw stones at others. If TMC wins uncontested then it is due to violence, but if BJP wins then it is a victory for democracy. The BJP and opposition parties should stop coming up with such childish logic."" Reacting to TMC's allegations, the BJP said not a single incident of violence was reported during the panchayat polls in Tripura. ""The TMC should not mix both the elections. Unlike panchayat elections in West Bengal, you cannot show a single incident of violence in the rural polls in Tripura,"" BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha told  . 
BJP Tripura spokesman Mrinal Kanti Deb told   that their candidates won uncontested due to ""spontaneous"" support of the people and that it has no comparison with the scenario in West Bengal where the poll was allegedly rigged. Elections were held in phases for 48,650 posts in gram panchayats, 825 posts in zilla parishads and 9,217 posts in panchayat samitis in West Bengal. The ruling TMC won about 34 per cent seats uncontested in May. The BJP and CPM had moved court demanding cancellation of elections at uncontested seats. The Supreme Court in August turned down the pleas. It, however, took note of allegations and said the aggrieved candidate may file election petitions to challenge panchayat polls in courts concerned. The CPM, which is the opposition party in Tripura and West Bengal, said TMC and BJP are different sides of the same coin and it is expected that they will follow the same kind of strategy when fighting elections.

Debobrat Ghose,"With hardly a few months left before the Assembly elections in Mizoram, the Congress-ruled state seems to be heading the Assam way. The Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) on Monday afternoon expelled its vice-president and state Home Affairs Minister R Lalzirliana for alleged ""anti-party activities"". The move has exposed the brewing dissension within the party in Mizoram  and the inefficiency of the Congress leadership to redress an ongoing feud. Issuing a notice on Monday afternoon, the chairperson of the Disciplinary Action Committee of the MPCC, C Lalpianthanga expelled Lalzirliana. ""It's an unfortunate incident ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Mizoram. The decision has been made by the disciplinary committee of the Mizoram PCC. The committee had issued a show cause notice to Lalzirliana a week ago and asked for his explanation,"" Luizinho Faleiro, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and party in-charge for the northeastern states (excluding Assam), told  . Lalzirliana's office also confirmed the news to  . Following his expulsion, if Lalzirliana — one of the most popular and powerful leaders in the Mizoram Congress — finally joins the Opposition Mizo National Front (MNF), it would be similar to what happened in Assam, when Himanta Biswa Sarma left the Congress to join the Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2015, Sarma, a former minister in Tarun Gogoi's cabinet and a popular Congress leader, quit the party following differences with Gogoi. In a letter to the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he had severely criticised the then Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and the leadership in Assam, alleging whimsical attitudes and apathy towards redressing issues. According to sources in the Mizoram Congress, there has been an ongoing conflict between Mizoram chief minister Lal Thanhawla, who is also the PCC president, and Lalzirliana, and the party leadership had shown no interest in resolving the dispute. ""It was due to the complete apathy of the AICC that never bothered to resolve the issue. The triggering factor was the long-pending demand by Lalzirliana to provide Saitual in his Tawi constituency the status of a district. Right from Rahul Gandhi to Chief Minister Thanhawla and PCC leaders, they had promised the district status, but later the chief minister went back on it. The Congress leadership never bothered to resolve this issue by calling the top leaders to Delhi,"" a source in the party said. The tension was at its peak when the state home minister tendered his resignation on 14 September. In his resignation letter, Lalzirliana mentioned that he was stepping down from the post in protest against the unfulfilled promise on Saitual. Lalzirliana has been elected from his constituency for four consecutive terms since 1998. ""Rahul Gandhi, during a campaign in Saitual as the Congress vice-president, had promised in the presence of the chief minister that if the Congress came to power, Lalzirliana's demand for a separate district would be fulfilled. But unfortunately, it wasn't. Thanhawla prevented it. This has given a message to the people of Mizoram that even Rahulji can't do anything against the chief minsiter's diktat,"" the party source added. Meanwhile, the MNF, in its poll campaign, has reportedly said that it will provide full district status to Saitual if it forms the government in Mizoram. A section within the Mizoram Congress feels that the sacking of Congress loyalist Lalzirliana is an ""act of Hara-kiri"" by the party as this decision will eventually revive MNF's fortune. The sources added that the Congress top leadership does not want to disturb the existing situation in Mizoram, which also speaks of the party's inefficiency and inaptitude, given how it allowed the local leadership to commit a blunder. ""The Mizoram Congress will ultimately fulfil Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi's dream of making India a ' ' by its own actions, which is very unfortunate. Lalzirliana is a very popular leader, and this fact didn't go down well with the PCC president. On the pretext of financial constraints, he prevented our vice-president's demand, dubbing it an 'anti-party activity'. The disciplinary committee simply followed  Thanhawla's directive and expelled Lalzirliana,"" a senior office-bearer in the MPCC told   on condition of anonymity.",2018-09-17,"AICC,Congress,Lal Thanhawla,Mizo National Front,Mizoram,Mizoram Congress,Mizoram Elections,MPCC,PoliticalDecoder,R Lalzirliana,Saitual,Tawi Constituency","With sacking of Mizoram Congress vice-president, state seems to be heading the Assam way for party ahead of polls",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/with-sacking-of-mizoram-congress-vice-president-state-seems-to-be-heading-the-assam-way-for-party-5201831.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Almost six days after a 19-year-old girl was gangraped in Haryana's Rewari district, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on the case is ""unacceptable"". Lamenting over the lack of safety for women in India, Congress chief tweeted saying, ""India hangs its head in shame as another one of its daughters is brutally gang raped and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""silence is unacceptable."" ""Shame on a government that leaves India’s women unprotected and afraid and allows rapists to walk free."" The Congress chief, who is  , also spoke out against rampant sexism while addressing a gathering.  ""Men have this mindset that women are not equal to them. This is something that we need to improve by means of social change — to make men realise that women are as capable as they are,"" Rahul said. The Congress chief added that it was important that women representatives in fields like politics and police are necessary now more than ever before. Bringing up the women's reservation bill which is pending in Parliament, Rahul said the prime minister was silent on the issue. ""We have committed to him — the moment the prime minister wants to pass the women's reservation bill, the Congress MPs will support him wholeheartedly. He has not responded."" So far, no political leader has commented on the brutal incident. The girl, a CBSE exam topper hailing from Rewari, was abducted from a bus stop in Kanina town of Mahendragarh district on 12 September when she was on her way to a coaching class. She was allegedly drugged and gangraped at a room adjoining a tubewell in an agricultural field, the police said. The Haryana police came under flak for dragging their feet over the initial stage of investigation, considered crucial in criminal cases.   in the state police department after media reports called out the ""discrepancies"" in the case. After the shunting out of Rewari Superintendent of Police (SP) Rajesh Duggal, a woman assistant sub-inspector has been suspended over alleged delay in taking action in the gangrape case of a 19-year-old woman. ""The orders to suspend ASI Hiramani of the Women's Police Station, Rewari were issued on Monday. She has been placed under suspension over allegations of delay in taking action on the complaint and negligence,"" a Rewari district police official said on Tuesday. Earlier, Duggal was moved out as the Rewari SP and Rahul Sharma was made the new district police chief. The victim's family has alleged that the police failed to take prompt action on their complaint and delayed action by citing jurisdictional issues between their units in Rewari and Mahendragarh districts. The family has alleged that the Women's Police Station in Rewari, after registering a ""zero FIR"" in the case, delayed action and failed to promptly hand over the probe to the Mahendragarh police, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place. A zero FIR can be filed at any police station and can later be transferred to the police station concerned. The case has prompted the opposition parties to demand Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's resignation on moral grounds, saying the state had failed to protect its daughters. The Congress on Monday demanded imposition of President's Rule in the state, alleging that the BJP-led government had utterly failed to tackle the law-and-order situation. Meanwhile, residents of the village where the woman was allegedly gangraped, claimed that the the spot where the crime took place was infamous for nefarious activities. They alleged that there were incidents of girls being harassed by vagabonds at the spot in the past as well. ""We demand an exemplary punishment for the accused. However, our plea is that no innocent youth of the village should be harassed by the police as many have been called for questioning,"" one of the villagers said. Meanwhile, teams of Haryana Police continued with their raids on Tuesday to nab the two prime accused in the case — armyman Pankaj and Manish. The Haryana Police has so far arrested three men in the case, including Nishu, who, according to the police, is one of the three main accused. The three arrested accused were remanded to a five-day police custody by a court in Kanina, Mahendragarh on Monday.

Debobrat Ghose,"Even if Ajay Maken doesn't resign as Delhi Congress chief, his ill-health which has been confirmed by the party is in all likelihood an indication that the senior leader will not be as active as expected in this crucial year ahead of the General Elections next year. Maken's reduced presence is likely to come as a blow to the already beleaguered Congress in Delhi. He is one of the most well-known faces of the party in the capital. Sheila Dikshit, the former Congress chief minister who ruled Delhi for 15 years has not been active ever since she lost the last Assembly election. Though Congress has denied the resignation of the Delhi Congress president, it has admitted that he has been on a leave due to health reasons and has gone for a checkup. Right from the morning on Tuesday, rumours were abuzz that Maken has tendered his resignation. But, later during the day, Delhi Congress in-charge PC Chacko clarified that Maken had gone for a medical check-up due to some health problem. “He has temporarily stepped down for his checkup and informed Congress president and me. He would be back by 22 September,” Chacko reportedly said. New Delhi district Congress president, Virendra Kasana, who’s close to Maken, denied the rumour of Delhi Congress chief’s resignation. “Ajay Maken  hasn’t resigned. Due to some health issues, he has gone for a checkup. He had recently met Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party in-charge of Delhi affairs PC Chacko,” Kasana told  Following the debacle in Delhi Assembly election in 2015, Maken stepped down as the Congress general secretary. Former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit had put the blame of the drubbing Congress suffered on Maken. As a result, both had a face-off for quite some time but later reconciled. Maken is not just another leader in Delhi Congress. A two-term Lok Sabha member and three-term MLA, Maken's presence is of importance if the party needs to work towards gaining its lost ground in Delhi. Having been a locally-groomed leader — his political career began as a student leader when he became president of Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) in 1985 — he knows the National Capital Region better than most others and individually, enjoys faith of even those voters who are anti-Congress. Despite being Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president, Maken has been actively involved during DUSU election and has a strong presence at the campus. “As PCC president, he has always been actively involved in DUSU elections,” former NSUI leader Neeraj Mishra said. Besides being the Speaker of Delhi Legislative Assembly at the age of 39, Maken was the youngest Union Cabinet minister from Congress party, who held several portfolios. Maken is equally popular among trade union leaders and activists. The credit goes to his uncle, late Lalit Maken, who was a known trade union leader. After the assassination of Lalit and his wife, Ajay joined active politics. “Ajay Maken follows his uncle’s legacy. He’s still popular among workers and actively takes up trade union issues. His impending health issue may prove detrimental for Delhi Congress. We all expect him to get back soon for the benefit of the party,” an associate of Maken and also a member of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) said. His importance was not lost on the central leadership when in May last year, he had resigned as the Delhi Congress chief after the party suffered heavily at the civic polls. The then Congress vice-president Rahul had not accepted his resignation and had asked him to continue. He was strongly opposed to the Congress joining hands with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during 2019 election. On Tuesday, Chacko clarified that Congress wouldn’t go for any tie-up with AAP. It is an open secret that there is a dearth of stellar leadership in the Delhi unit of the Congress party. Besides Maken, there's hardly any leader who enjoys mass, popular support, or even a name recall. That's a tough situation in a city that it ruled for 15 years and then lost ignominiously to the AAP — the capital will go to the polls to elect its Assembly in a little over a year from now and the leadership deficit will place the party in a sticky situation.

FP Staff,"As the controversy over the Rafale fighter jet deal rages on, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday questioned the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) for not going forward with the deal during their term at the Centre. During an interaction at the Indian Women's Press Corp, the minister also took on Congress leader AK Antony, who had accused her of suppressing facts on the contract with France. Sitharaman hit back, saying that the Congress party was levelling baseless allegations against the government. She also questioned why the Congress had put the Rafale pact on the back burner if it was so sure it had negotiated the best deal with France. ""Why did the Congress not go ahead with the deal?"" she asked. Earlier on Tuesday, Antony had accused Sitharaman of trying to tarnish the image of public-sector firm Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), both nationally and internationally, by questioning its credibility. In response, Sitharaman said that the entire controversy around HAL not being chosen happened during the UPA's tenure, and that every question related to HAL should be answered by the UPA. ""UPA could have strengthened HAL. Every question should actually go to them. They didn't take care of HAL,"" she said. The defence minister added that since HAL and Dassault Aviation, the French firm that manufactures Rafale fighter jets, could not agree on the terms of production, the Congress government dropped it from the agreement. Sitharaman also said that Antony is a very senior leader, and having been in the ministry before her, he understands the negotiations. She added that the Rafale negotiations were not ""over the counter"" purchases. ""Orders will have to be placed and then will be made. So there is a timeline when purchasing such equipment for defence."" Countering the Congress' claim that they had negotiated a cheaper deal, Sitharaman said that after taking into account all the price escalations, the Narendra Modi government's negotiated price was 9 percent cheaper. ""We have responded saying your basic price and the basic price that I am getting at, when compared with all the escalation and other things, is 9 percent cheaper,"" she said. At a press conference earlier in the day, the Congress leader had asked whether the price of the Rafale aircraft were cheaper than that negotiated by the UPA. He had also questioned why the Centre did not buy 126 aircraft, as the Congress said was required, instead of 36 from the French manufacturer. In response, Sitharaman said that these 126 jets will also have to be bought on order and, therefore, will have a timeline and follow all related conditions like escalation costs.  that the Modi government publish the price of the Congress-UPA's deal of 126 aircraft and the price of its 36 Rafale deals, including per aircraft price of the same to clear the doubts of the people of India. Let the nation decide who is correct."" ""Recently, the law minister claimed that in the new agreement, the Rafale aircraft is 9 percent cheaper than the UPA's negotiated price. The finance minister said it is 20 percent cheaper. Then an Indian Air Force officer said it is 40 percent cheaper. Why did they not buy more than 126 if it was cheaper?"" Antony asked. Deviating from the Rafale controversy, Sitharaman said that Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu's gesture of hugging the Pakistan Army chief had affected soldiers back home. She asserted that the Punjab minister could have ""avoided it"". Cricketer-turned politician Sidhu had courted controversy by hugging Pakistan Army Chief of Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa during his visit to Islamabad for Imran Khan's swearing-in as prime minister. ""Sidhu has a lot of admirers... Somebody of that stature going there and then hugging the chief of the army, an army about which in India we have very clear feelings, it certainly has an impact on soldiers... It demoralises people. I wish  ,"" the defence minister said. Sitharaman also said that negotiations with Russia on the S-400 missile deal were almost complete.

Press Trust of India," A three-member team of central observers of the ruling BJP arrived in Goa on Sunday afternoon to take stock of the political situation in view of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar's indisposition, even as the Congress said it is watching the developments. Parrikar, 62, has been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi for treatment. Some media reports have suggested that the BJP is exploring alternatives for the chief minister's position in Goa till Parrikar gets well. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sent its national general secretaries BL Santhosh and Ram Lal and Goa in-charge Vijay Puranik to assess the situation in the state, where the party came to power with the support of regional outfits and Independents. ""They will be holding a series of meetings on Sunday and Monday with BJP leaders and also the alliance partners — the Goa Forward Party, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and the Independents,"" BJP state chief Vinay Tendulkar told reporters. The central observers met the party's legislators as well as Goa unit chief Vinay Tendulkar and Member of Parliament (South Goa) Narendra Sawaikar at a city hotel on Sunday. Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane, after the meeting, said that he had given his views about the current political situation and it was now for the party to take a decision. Rane, however, refused to divulge details of the meeting. ""We have briefed them about the facts. Each one of us has our own views and we briefed them about it. It is not right to come out in public with what we discussed,"" he said. Deputy Speaker of State Legislative Assembly Michael Lobo told reporters that the meeting was centred around the functioning of the government and Parrikar's ailment. ""The observers sent by the party high command are monitoring the situation. Let them report to the high command and come back to us with a solution to the problem,"" Lobo said. On being asked about what the problem was, the deputy speaker said, ""There is no problem in the party. Right now, the chief minister is not well, that is the problem,"" he said. The observers are expected to meet leaders of the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), allies in the Parrikar government, later Sunday, party functionaries said. Lobo had told   on Saturday that the party emissaries will suggest the allies that they should become part of the saffron party. ""A proposal will be made to the GFP and the MGP, asking them to merge with the BJP. Only after that, we will take up issues such as who will be the next chief minister or who will take over the charge or anything related to it,"" Lobo had said. The BJP currently has 14 legislators in the 40-member assembly while the GFP and the MGP have three each. The saffron party is also supported by three Independents. The Opposition Congress has 16 MLAs while the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has one legislator. The Congress said on Sunday it was watching the developments and may explore the possibility of forming government in Goa but ""not by compromising the state's interest"". ""Our stand is very clear. We will definitely explore all possibilities but that does not mean that we will do it by compromising the ideology or the interest of Goans,"" All India Congress Committee secretary A Chellakumar, who is also Goa in-charge of the party, said. ""We are not in a hurry to capture power by compromising the interest of the people of Goa. The Congress is accountable to the people,"" he said. Chellakumar said his party was watching the developments in the state. ""All our MLAs are together. We are watching what is going on in the ruling camp. The internal bickering has already started. The cabinet ministers have started throwing stones at each other,"" he said. The Congress leader said all legislators in Goa, cutting across party lines, should take a stand for the sake of the state. Parrikar was admitted to the AIIMS on Saturday morning. He had undergone a three-month-long treatment in the United States for pancreatic ailment earlier this year.

He will take part in a roadshow and also address party workers during his day-long visit to the state capital. Rahul will arrive at Bhopal airport by an aircraft at around noon on Monday. At 1 pm, he will then begin on a 15-kilometer-long roadshow from Lalghati Chowk, located close to the airport, after seeking the blessings of more than 11 Hindu priests, state party spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi told   on Sunday.

Press Trust of India," Goa Congress legislators will meet Governor Mridula Sinha Tuesday evening with a demand for dismissal of the Manohar Parrikar-led government and allowing the Opposition party to stake claim for forming an alternate government. The move comes at a time when 62-year-old Parrikar is admitted in the AIIMS in Delhi for a pancreatic ailment. Goa is being ruled by the BJP-led alliance headed by Parrikar. The Congress, which has 16 members in the 40-member state Assembly, on Monday submitted a memorandum to the Governor in her absence, urging her not to dissolve the Assembly and instead invite the party to form the alternate government. All the 16 Congress MLAs, led by their leader Chandrakant Kavlekar, had submitted the memorandum to Governor office. Speaking to  , Kavlekar said the governor, who was away from the state, arrived in Goa at 3 pm on Tuesday and her office called him for the meeting of the Congress legislators with her at 6.30 pm. ""We all 16 MLAs will be meeting the governor and will request her to dismiss the present government. We will also ask her to invite us to form the new government,"" he said. He said the Congress has support of legislators from other parties and can form the government, if given a chance by the governor. He, however, refused to spell out who all are supporting the Congress. ""We will prove our majority on the floor of the House,"" Kavlekar said. The Leader of the Opposition said the BJP has a habit of forcing governor's rule in a state where they fail to rule and the Congress will not allow to happen it. The BJP has 14 seats in the Assembly, its allies Goa Forward Party and MGP have three each. Three Independents and an MLA from Nationalist Congress Party also support the BJP. BJP leader Ram Lal had said on Monday that the Goa government is stable and no demand has been made for a change in the leadership. He stated this after a meeting with party MLAs, former legislators and core committee members. He said the BJP's alliance partners – the Goa Forward Party (GFP), the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and Independents – conveyed that they will agree to any political decision taken by the saffron party. Earlier too, the Congress had staked claim on 18 May, 2018 to form the government in Goa, citing the example of Karnataka where the largest party BJP was invited to form the government after the Assembly polls threw up a fractured verdict. The Congress had said that it had not been invited to form the government in Goa after the Assembly polls in March last year despite it emerging as the largest single party.

TS Sudhir,"The BJP is on a casting spree in Telangana. Its pre-election production in India's youngest state borrows liberally from the events surrounding the liberation of Hyderabad on 17 September, 1948. The kingdom of Hyderabad joined the Indian Union 13 months after India gained independence. This was made possible through 'Operation Polo', mounted by the Indian forces that marched into Nizam's territory. Taking its hero worship of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel a step further, the BJP is positioning itself as the force that will liberate Hyderabad State, which is pretty much modern-day Telangana, from the rule of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). In the BJP's book, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the modern-day Sardar Patel. India's first home minister was against giving Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, an extended reign. Khan wanted to remain an independent monarch, a proposition unacceptable to New Delhi. This political posturing features TRS chief and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekar Rao as the modern-day Nizam, underlining his inclination to live in luxury: the chief minister's official residence-cum-office built at a cost of Rs 40 crore cited as a case in point. On Saturday, BJP chief Amit Shah pointed to KCR ruling from his palatial bungalow instead of going to the official Secretariat, suggesting a monarch-like mindset. Incidentally, on previous occasions, KCR has admitted to admiration for Mir Osman Ali Khan, refuting the view of many historians that the Nizam was a tyrant. The third important character in the BJP script is Asaduddin Owaisi, who Shah indirectly called a ""modern-day Razakar''. This is a deliberate attempt to sully the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) chief as the man who headed the Razakars, a private militia of sorts, who was a lawyer from Latur called Qasim Rizvi. The Razakars were initially set up as a volunteer force (Razakar means volunteer in Arabic) but under Rizvi, it took to crushing any dissent against the Nizam by the freedom fighters. They wanted the Nizam's rule to continue and despite warning that it could result in bloodshed, took on the Indian forces between 13 and 17 September, 1948. Historian Mohammed Safiullah, an authority on the rule of the Nizam, pointed out that the precursor to the modern-day MIM was the Majlis-e-Ittehad Hyderabad (MIH). ""It was founded in 1927 as a religious and cultural outfit. The MIH was also a counterpoint of sorts to the Hindu outfits such as the RSS, which was founded in 1925,'' says Safiullah. In 1944, after the death of its leader Bahadur Yar Jung under suspicious circumstances due to poisoning at the age of 39, the reigns of MIH passed on to Razakar leader Qasim Rizvi. After Operation Polo, Rizvi was arrested. He was released in 1957 on the condition that he would migrate to Pakistan. The leadership of the MIH, now rechristened as MIM, passed on to Abdul Wahed Owaisi, Asaduddin Owaisi's grandfather. This is how the Owaisis and the MIM are linked to the brutal Razakars. The BJP is keen to take advantage of the MIM leader in the Telangana Assembly, Akbaruddin Owaisi's recent comment asking why it should be presumed that only KCR will become the chief minister of Telangana and why the post cannot be held by one of them. Though MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi clarified that his party supports KCR, the BJP is keen to exploit Owaisi junior's desire to be the HD Kumaraswamy of Telangana. The BJP's messaging is that it is time to dethrone the ""new Nizam"", lest his friendly ally ""the descendants of the party of the Razakars'' rule Telangana. It helps the BJP cause that 17 September falls in the run-up to the elections in Telangana, when it will be seventy years since the liberation of Hyderabad and assimilation into the Indian Union. Accusing KCR of not celebrating Hyderabad Liberation Day as a State function because of MIM pressure, Amit Shah has promised to do so if the BJP comes to power. In any case, the idea is to make it an election issue. The hope is that the MIM versus BJP polarisation, especially in pockets with a significant Muslim population, will fetch electoral dividend. But it won't be so easy. KCR is more Hindu than most leaders of the BJP, given to great belief in astrology and numerology and performing extensive pujas to Hindu deities. And despite Shah's denials, there is a suspicion that the BJP leadership has struck a deal with KCR, looking at a post-poll relationship in 2019. The BJP's attack on KCR is seen as a ploy to splinter the Opposition vote, benefitting the TRS in the bargain. KCR would also prefer a reasonably strong BJP in Telangana to act as a foil to the Congress which is the principal Opposition party in the state. During Khan's reign, it used to be said about him that Hindus and Muslims are like his two eyes. The joke doing the rounds in Telangana is that for KCR, the MIM and the BJP are like his two eyes.",2018-11-01,"Assembly Election 2018,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,Elections,Grand Alliance,Hyderabad,InMyOpinion,K.

""The chief minister will hold a rally in Badal's assembly constituency Lambi in the last week of September after zila parishad elections in the state,"" the spokesperson said. He said Amarinder Singh had taken serious note of Badal's ""continued and wilful attempts to create communal unrest in the state through his deceitful statements on the report of Justice (Retd) Ranjit Singh Commission on the widespread incidents of sacrilege that had taken place during the SAD-BJP rule"".

Notably, addressing party's 'Pol Khol' rally in Faridkot on Sunday, Badal said he and his son Sukhbir were ""ready to sacrifice"" their lives for defending the cause of peace and communal harmony in the state.

""Fortunately, however, the people of Punjab had seen through his attempts to destabilise the state and had voted him and his party decisively out of power,"" he added. ""With the parliamentary elections now around the corner, Badal is once again trying to whip up communal passions in a desperate bid to retrieve the lost political ground for his Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD),"" Amarinder Singh alleged further.

Earlier on Sunday, Mayawati had said, ""The efforts of Opposition parties will be to stop the BJP from coming to power at any cost. For this talks of forging an alliance is also going on. Our party is not against the alliance, but our stand is very clear. That is, we will ally with a political party only if we get respectable share of seats. Or else, our party feels it is better to contest elections alone."" On the BSP chief's statement that the BJP is not leaving any stone unturned to derive mileage from the demise of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP media co-ordinator said: ""Mayawati has honoured so many great and eminent personalities by constructing their statues in Lucknow. I fail to understand why is she having any problem if the BJP is holding various programmes in honour and memory of Atalji."" Tripathi said: ""Mayawati has been treating Dalits as her vote bank. The BJP on the other hand has worked to increase the bank balance of the Dalits. She is visualising that her bank is being virtually robbed. Hence, she is worried.",2018-09-17,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,BSP,BSP Alliance,BSP Seats,Dalits,Mayawati,NewsTracker,Opposition,Rakesh Tripathi,Uttar Pradesh","From whom is Mayawati expecting 'respectable seat share', BJP asks after BSP chief's remarks on forging alliances",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/from-whom-is-mayawati-expecting-respectable-seat-share-bjp-asks-after-bsp-chiefs-remarks-on-forging-alliances-5198661.html,firstpost,-1,0
Suhit K Sen,"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has not exactly nailed her colours to the mast of a grand alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the series of impending elections set to culminate in those for the Lok Sabha next year, but what she has said does provide cause for quiet optimism among those who would like to see the back of the current regime. What Mayawati has said is not, as a matter of fact, radically new. It is a reiteration of her position that the BSP is open to an anti-BJP alliance but only on ‘respectable’ terms. What is significant about this iteration, however, is the timing, with elections to three states — Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan — just around the corner. Negotiations with regard to opposition unity have already gathered pace, which is precisely what makes Mayawati’s statement, made on Sunday, significant, especially since observers believe, with good reason, that the outcome of this round of Assembly elections will have a decisive bearing on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. What Mayawati has said is, first, that her ‘sole’ aim is to prevent Prime Minister Narendra Modi from returning to power. She has also signalled that she is open to an inclusive opposition alliance to achieve this objective. But the rider is that her party has to be given a ‘respectable’ number of seats. It is hardly surprising or particularly significant, however, that Mayawati would like to keep her bargaining power intact. No one would seriously expect leaders of political parties to commit to an alliance without doing this. The devil, therefore, will lie in the detail. And the most relevant details, in this case, are the positions taken by the other relevant parties. It has been reported that the Congress leadership, led by party president Rahul Gandhi, is anxious to secure as many alliances as possible. It is not difficult to imagine that the party will go a fair distance to accommodate Mayawati.  has also made it clear that he is keen to keep as many allies as possible on board. Principal among them will, of course, be the BSP. He has said quite unequivocally that he is willing to take ‘two steps backwards to accommodate the alliance partner’. It appears, then, that the most important factor that will influence the outcome of alliance-building initiatives will be Mayawati’s actual actions, rather than public pronouncements, which we all know are swathed in layers of ambiguity. The dangers of reading too much into what Mayawati says is especially high given her often unilateral ways. Let us take, as example, her initial demands. It has been reported that Mayawati wants 30 of the 90 seats in Chhattisgarh, 100 of the 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh and 70 of the 200 seats in Rajasthan for starters.  , she has reportedly laid claim to 40 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. Her tally in the Assembly elections five years ago was one in Chhattisgarh, four in Madhya Pradesh and two in Rajasthan. In 2014, she failed to win a single Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh. It goes without saying, thus, that this ambitious charter is a bargaining position. That is not the point, however. Two things are important in this context: the first is how reasonable Mayawati will be when she sits down with Congress leaders to sort out seat-sharing details for the Assembly elections, which are almost upon us; the second is how accommodating Congress leaders will be. We will discuss the Uttar Pradesh negotiations in a bit because the multi-party situation there offers a different dynamic. In an ideal world, the two sides would be guided by the principle of ‘winnability’ to maximise seats for the alliance, but in a far from the perfect world that almost never happens. The surreal seat-sharing deal between the SP and the Congress in the 2017 elections in Uttar Pradesh, in which the latter was given an insane number of completely ‘unwinnable’ seats in a last-minute deal, is a classic example of this. Having allowed matters to drift, thus necessitating eleventh-hour negotiations yet again, the Congress, as the senior partner, will not be in the best of bargaining positions in any of the three states. But the central leadership will have to impress upon state satraps that they will have to accept negotiated positions, assuming these emerge at all, in the interests of a larger opposition unity, with the 2019 elections in mind. This enterprise will not necessarily be an easy one.   that he is not interested in an alliance with the BSP. But the Congress cannot afford a cherry-picking approach. Though obstacles in the way of alliances in all three states are formidable, it is possible that Mayawati will be reasonable about what constitutes a ‘respectable number of seats’, given her compulsions in Uttar Pradesh. That state remains at the heart of both the project of opposition unity and BJP’s ongoing Hindutva push and programme of electoral engineering. Clearly, Mayawati does not expect that she will get 40 out of 80 seats. Even if the SP agrees to a fifty-fifty split, other partners, mainly the Congress and Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal, will have to be accommodated. It would be absurd to expect that Akhilesh would agree to accommodate them solely out of his quota. Again, in an ideal world winnability and the need to bring as many caste agglomerations into the fold would have been the basis for talks. But in an imperfect world, Mayawati might push for more than her share of winnable seats in a more plural setting. There are indications that Mayawati and Yadav might do a deal in which the Congress would be squeezed. If that happens, the Congress can hardly protest too vocally given that its footprint in the state can barely be seen. All opposition leaders must also remember to keep the Bhim Army in the loop, especially after the BJP was forced to release its leader, Chandrashekhar Yadav or Ravana. The Bhim Army is a potent force and could play an important role in consolidating Dalit votes against the BJP. Opposition leaders will, however, have to convince Mayawati, notwithstanding the snub she delivered to Ravana on Sunday, that he is an ally rather than a threat to her pre-eminent position as the Dalit voice of Uttar Pradesh and India. The next couple of weeks will show how things are likely to pan out. But it does now appear that if all opposition leaders, especially Mayawati, demonstrate a bare minimum of reasonableness and good faith, the prospects of unity are very real, despite the mountains that will have to be climbed.",2018-09-17,"Ajit Singh,Akhilesh Yadav,Bahujan Samaj Party,Bhim Army,BJP,Congress,Hindutva,Lok Sabha Election 2019,Mayawati,Narendra Modi,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Rahul Gandhi,Rashtriya Lok Dal,Sachin Pilot,Samajwadi Party",Mayawati keen to join anti-BJP alliance but may play hardball with Congress over 'respectable' terms,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/mayawati-keen-to-join-anti-bjp-alliance-but-may-play-hardball-with-congress-over-respectable-terms-5198311.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"It is no surprise that the words 'master election strategist' often preface the latest JD(U) entrant Prashant Kishor's name. Known for running some of the most successful political campaigns in recent times, it is Kishor who steered Prime Minister Narendra Modi to victory in the 2012 Gujarat Assembly polls and, the more significant, 2014 Lok Sabha elections. On Sunday, Kishor formally joined the Janata Dal (United) at a party meeting in Patna, setting off murmurs among the party that Bihar chief minister and JD(U) chief   as his ""political successor"". Kishor, who recently said that he would not campaign for anyone in the 2019 elections, has in the past worked with the Bharatiya Janata Party, JD(U) and Congress on several electoral campaigns. Born in 1977, Kishor, a public health expert, spent eight years working at the United Nations before joining political parties to help with their campaigns. He is the former head of Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), which was later reformulated to Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC). His work with BJP during the 2014 general elections earned him the tag of being the ""most trusted strategist in the Narendra Modi organisation,"" according to  Here is a brief look at his journey across the various parties so far: Kishor's work with the BJP has been successful so far. After leading the saffron party, led by Modi, to a victory in the 2012 Gujarat Assembly election, he and his team at CAG took up the mantle of laying the ground to replicate Modi's win in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. If in retrospect, one hails Modi's use of social media to expand his voter base, the credit goes to Kishor. Influenced by former US president Barack Obama's use of social media and communication strategies during his presidential campaigns, the election strategist sought to bring in number crunchers, communication experts, media planners, technology, and surveyors to build the campaign, reported  It was Kishor's team that came up with ' ', simultaneous projection of Modi's speeches through hologram technology etc. However, several members of the BJP and RSS, including Amit Shah, felt Kishor's and his CAG did not play a significant role in BJP's victory, and that BJP's victory was more to the brand Modi had already created for himself. This led to Kishor's departure. It is believed he told Modi, ""When two brothers fail to get along, it is better for one of them to leave,"" as per the  report. A year later, Kishor and his IPAC team landed in Bihar, this time to tackle the 2015 Bihar Assembly election for Nitish Kumar. A native of Bihar, Kishor helped Kumar secure a third consecutive term in the state, defeating the BJP-led NDA. The saffron party failed even after Modi addressed nearly 31 election rallies in the state, according to  . Substituting Modi's  with  for Kumar's campaign, Kishor sought feedback from people on the government's performance over the previous decade. Kishor and his team came up with the campaign slogan "" "" and used vibrant colours of red and yellow on posters to people's attention. He also devised the  (Knock on every door) campaign to help party workers establish a closer connect with the masses, as per a  report. Some of the other initiatives that were undertaken were GPS enabled bicycles and deployment of women to campaign from door-to-door. As JD(U) won the elections that year, the BJP had to begrudgingly accept that while their party leaders were relentlessly criss-crossing Bihar and giving speeches, Kishor's resourceful campaign had helped cut through the fluff and connected with the people. In 2016, Kishor moved to Congress in Punjab to help Captain Amarinder Singh win the state Assembly polls. His electioneering machinery worked the magic again as Congress received a historic win. Kishor's team introduced the ' , along with 'Punjab da Captain' revolving around Singh. Party leaders said he   interactions of college students with Singh and appointed local 'kaptans' for the campaign. The Congress ended up bagging 77 seats in the 117-seat Assembly. Based on this success, he was roped in to run the campaign in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. However, this time, he failed to influence and replicate Congress' victory in Punjab. At present, Kishor is working on the campaign for YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh ahead of the Assembly polls in 2019, reported  . He has been working with Jaganmohan Reddy since last year.",2018-09-17,"Bharatiya Janata Party,BIhar,BJP,Congress,ConnectTheDots,Election Strategist,Election Strategy,JD(U),Nitish Kumar,Prashant Kishor,YSRCP","Prashant Kishor joins JD(U): Election strategist has worked on campaigns for BJP, Congress, JD(U) in the past",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/prashant-kishor-joins-jdu-election-strategist-has-worked-on-campaigns-for-bjp-congress-jdu-in-the-past-5198421.html,firstpost,-1,0

Angshuman Choudhury,"As the   from this year’s Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) elections came in, it once again became apparent why the current political dispensation, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Sangh, and their student affiliates in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have always been so obsessively mindful of this campus. They are, after all, not used to being challenged with such infectious assertion and solidarity elsewhere. The ABVP, despite its signature attempts to sabotage the counting process through violence and hooliganism, lost all the central panel seats to the ‘Left Unity’ (a coalition of four left parties) by large margins. The Right-wing student party even lost significant chunks of votes from the Sciences schools, which are considered to be its core constituencies. The margins of loss were less than consoling: the ABVP president candidate, Lalit Pandey, lost to his Left Unity counterpart, N Sai Balaji, by a daunting 1,179 votes. As the leads began to trickle in, JNU students got their first glimpse of what Delhi University is thoroughly familiar with: SUV politics. Multiple first-person accounts accused ABVP cadres, including former JNUSU joint secretary Saurabh Sharma, of bringing in vehicles filled with goons armed with sticks and rods into the campus when the leads began to pour in. Even on Monday, the newly-elected president, Balaji, accused Sharma and his gang of violently assaulting students inside the campus. Sharma, however, accused the left parties of attacking ABVP cadres. ] Clearly, the party is struggling to stomach its inglorious defeat. To compensate, it is out to intimidate the student community and political opponents with punches, kicks, sticks, and stones. But, unfortunately for them, JNU isn’t any other university: the rejoinder has already come in the form of a stunning democratic mandate against the Sangh’s politics of fear. No amount of violent coercion can overturn that. Make no mistake, these results stand as proof of the fact that India’s best-known Central university will not vindicate the saffron politics of hate and fear anytime soon, despite the most systematic of efforts at subversion. In an otherwise national playfield where the BJP-Sangh might be winning elections block after block despite its patently communal and propagandist agendas, here is an island of collective dissent that remains steadfastly assertive of its rich democratic tradition. JNU has seen a lot after the BJP government came to power in 2014. From receiving a police battalion in its doorstep for the first time since 1983 to falling at the short end of the administration’s relentless attacks on the university’s traditions, JNUites have had an unprecedented four years under the current regime’s shadows. These results, thus, are nothing short of a victory mile for all those who care about keeping India's university campuses free from ideological homogenisation and administrative hegemony. The signalling takes an even more loaded significance in light of the upcoming national election in 2019: Modi Hawa or Modi tsunami, JNU does not care and stands resolutely against BJP and its divisive, sentimental politics. The mood of the nation is coalescing fast, and opinions are being frozen. In such a situation, a massive mandate against the saffron coterie by young, educated people in India’s capital city is something that the ruling party can only overlook to its own peril. The JNUSU results should also be read in a broader context of other recent campus elections, including the   in Panjab University by 22-year old Kanupriya who belongs to the Left-leaning Students for Society (SFS), and the ABVP’s   in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal University and Gurukul Kangri University. Notably, these are familiar territories for the right-wing party, which now finds itself decisively challenged and floundering for mandates. Together, these new trends tell us that the saffron cheerleaders might have taken India's young minds for granted too soon; that no amount of intimidation, coercion, slandering, and misinformation can finish off opposing ideological persuasions so easily; that the project of intellectual homogenisation is a total non-starter in a democratically vibrant country like India. However, the Left parties in JNU, too, cannot take their student constituencies for granted. In a situation where the ABVP has come only second, the Left alliance cannot afford to project even the slightest hint of disunity. More importantly, it must create agendas and platforms that are fully inclusive and mindful of differing persuasions, rather than propagating an only benign version of the ABVP’s sectarian, divisive politics. This is particularly so given the upward trajectory of identity-based student parties, like the BAPSA. Even the NOTA constituency, which clocked at a significant  this time (only slightly lower than last year), must be a beacon of warning to the left parties. Further, as much as national political issues are important (especially because of the fast approaching national election), the winning alliance needs to bring the focus back to core student welfare. As student parties, their foremost priority is to ensure that the student community’s needs and grievances are duly addressed. More crucially, the dominant Left parties, rather than hegemonizing the space for dissent, must ensure that ordinary students are given greater agency in movements and protests. In short, they need to render JNU’s campus politics more participatory and deliberative than it was ever before. In a situation otherwise, belligerent groups like the ABVP are bound to invalidate it to the point of transforming it into a passive, heavily technocratic college campus that only claps, not questions; that cheers, not demonstrate. That would be incredibly tragic for JNU -- the last hope for a truly democratic, liberal university space in the midst of an authoritarian, anti-intellectual swamp.",2018-09-19,"AVBP,BJP,JNUSU,N Sai Balaji","Ahead of Lok Sabha 2019 polls, ABVP's failures in JNUSU election indicate young India isn't too impressed with BJP",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ahead-of-lok-sabha-2019-polls-abvps-failures-in-jnusu-election-indicate-young-india-isnt-too-impressed-with-bjp-5199691.html,firstpost,-1,0

""The political alliance of Owaisi and Ambedkar is only for someone's defeat and is a well-planned strategy,"" it said, without naming any party.  on Saturday that both parties will forge an alliance for the Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly polls in 2019.

It said instead of openly joining hands with the BJP, they have chosen to set up a new front, which has nothing to do with the line of thinking of late Babasaheb Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution. ""Babasaheb fought against the wrong, unjust traditions of Hindu religion but he never joined hands with radical Muslim groups. He even rejected an offer to convert to Islam,"" the Marathi publication said. The AIMIM is a ""corrupt version"" of the Muslim League, it alleged, adding that it is involved in Muslim vote bank politics. ""One Owaisi brother had allegedly remarked that 25 crore Muslims could easily overpower Hindus in this country. The grandson of late Babasaheb Ambedkar joining hands with such people is like betraying people of his own community,"" it said. ""However, any rational Muslim or a scheduled caste youth will not fall for such a bogus alliance,"" it added.

The leaders are more interested in their self-growth than helping the community, the Sena said.

The Birsa Ambedkar Phule Student Association's (BAPSA) presidential candidate, Thallapelli Praveen, said his party represents the voice of students from the oppressed classes on the campus. Praveen asked students to think beyond the left and right binary. ""The Left parties say that the BAPSA should not be voted for, otherwise the ABVP will come. The ABVP is alive and among us, and that is the contribution of Left politics on campus. Don't get caught in the banner of left and right politics, and work for the oppressed,"" he said. The voter turnout in the keenly contested JNUSU election was 67.8 percent, believed to be the highest in six years. Over 5,000 students cast their votes. Over 5,000 students cast their votes.

Indo-Asian News Service," Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Saturday ruled out any alliance with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) for the coming Assembly polls in the state and said the TRS owed an explanation to the people for imposing additional expenditure by going for early elections.

The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee, unit of Indian National Congress in Goa, has also appealed to state Governor Mridula Sinha to give the Congress an opportunity to form a stable government in the state. A statement was issued by Goa Pradesh Congress Committee's president Girish Chodankar, which said, ""The Congress has never hesitated to play the role of a constructive and effective Opposition, but we will not hesitate to come forward and take responsibility to form a government. We have already cautioned Honorable Governor Her Excellency Dr Mridula Sinha about a possible ploy by the BJP to fraudulently impose President's Rule in Goa, through the back door.""

FP Staff,"The United Left Alliance clinched victory in all central panel posts of the JNUSU, defeating RSS-affiliated ABVP. Left presidential candidate N Sai Balaji won with 2,151 votes with a margin of 1,179 votes. ABVP garnered 972 votes. As per the latest update, Left alliance candidate N Sai Balaji is ahead of ABVP in the presidential run with 1,948 votes, while the latter has only 875 votes. Till now, 4,709 votes have been counted out of the more than 5,000 votes polled. So far, the Left alliance (SFI-AISA-AISF-DSF) is leading on all central panel posts. Nidhi Tripathi, last year's presidential candidate from ABVP, accused the Left alliance of indulging in violence. She said, ""Supporters of the Left Union threw the barricade outside the SIS counting centre. Due to the chaos they created, a security guard got hurt on his leg. And the ABVP supporters helped him in getting the proper medical facilities."" She also alleged the election committee was biased against the ABVP. As per the latest vote count tally, the Left alliance's N Sai Balaji is currently leading in the president's post with 1,193 votes followed by ABVP's Lalit Pandey (561 votes), BAPSA's Thallapelli Praveen (391 votes), RJD's Jayant Kumar (318 votes) and NSUI's Vikas Yadav (222 votes). To keep the counting transparent, constant announcements are being made about the total vote count and the specific vote share for each candidate. This procedure is very different from the recent DUSU elections where no initiative was take to ensure transparency. Counting of votes in the JNU students union polls was suspended for over 14 hours on Saturday by election authorities citing ""forcible entry"" and ""attempts to snatch away ballot boxes"" at the counting venue, after the ABVP staged protests claiming it was not informed about the start of the process. The counting, which was suspended at 4 am, resumed at 6.30 pm after two teachers from the Grievance Redressal Cell were appointed as observers for the exercise, officials said. The counting process was stalled after Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) which is the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), staged protest alleging they were not informed about the process. The JNU Election Committee said ""the counting process, which began on 14 September at 10 pm has been suspended due to forcible entry into the counting venue and attempts to snatch away the sealed ballot boxes as well as ballot papers from our counting centres."" The Left outfits alleged that the ABVP was involved in the violence but the saffron outfit denied it. The deadlock at the Jawaharlal Nehru University persisted till evening with the ABVP accusing the election authorities of bias towards the Left outfits and threatening to move court. The Election Committee, however, issued a statement saying it had made announcement for counting agents to come and was following the rules. It said, ""A malicious lie is being spread on social media and among students that the Election Committee had not made three announcements and went forth with the entry of the counting agents for post of Central Panel for combined schools and Special Centres."" The Election Committee would like to clearly state three announcement calls were made (with the third call announced as the last and final call) and communicated to the students gathered outside the counting venue) via loudspeaker, the committee said. ""After that the election committee members informed the security guards about it and asked them to gather any counting agents. ""Fourteen counting agents for 10 different candidates had reported at the counting venue. After which counting process had started and sealed boxes were opened in the presence of the counting agents,"" it said. As per the established norms, no new counting agents can enter the counting venue, once the seal of the boxes is opened. ""Election Committee (EC) had to reject the request of new counting agents being allowed inside that respective counting venue. Few students had forcibly entered the building and reached the counting venue, thus we had to suspend the counting process,"" it said. The panel also claimed that their members, including women, faced intimidation. President of ABVP-JNU unit Vijay Kumar said they will not hesitate to approach the Delhi High Court if they do not get justice. ""Counting of votes is being done without adhering to the rules. The EC is not following even the bare minimum requirements of election procedure. ""The biased way of handling elections has put a question mark on EC's neutrality. We have approached the Grievance Redressal Cell to seek justice. We will not hesitate to proceed to Delhi High Court if we don't get justice,"" he added. The Grievance Redressal Cell is a body comprising the varsity's professors which addresses election related complaints. In the evening, it was announced that the Cell has appointed two observers for the counting if votes. The ABVP claimed their counting agent was not informed about the beginning of counting of votes polled in science schools. The Left bloc claimed that ""around 4 am, ABVP broke the glasses of the School of International Studies building"". They also claimed the ABVP counting agent was called but he did not turn up on time. Kumar claimed their counting agent was not called and the counting process was initiated in front of the members of the Left outfit. ""We protested peacefully as the EC is biased towards the Left. We did not create any ruckus,"" he said. The voter turnout in the keenly contested JNUSU election on Friday was 67.8 percent, believed to be the highest in six years.

Indo-Asian News Service," Accusing the Telangana government of trying to vitiate the upcoming Assembly polls by ""manipulating voters lists"", the Congress on Sunday demanded the Election Commission's (EC) intervention for verification and sanitisation of electoral rolls. Alleging that as many as 70 lakh names in the electoral lists have been manipulated, Congress MP wondered if the ""contamination of the voter lists"" was the reason behind the K Chandrashekar Rao government prematurely dissolving the Telangana Assembly to swing elections in their favour. ""Rao rushed to announce the dates for the Telangana Assembly elections and deliberately chose to ignore the numerous discrepancies in the voter lists which disenfranchise lakhs of eligible voters and completely erode the integrity of the elections, whenever they are conducted,"" Singhvi told the media here. ""It is clear that the caretaker Chief Minister of Telangana is sacrificing the integrity of the elections for the sake of his petty political ambitions."" Singhvi said that an inquiry by the party has revealed that at least 30.13 lakh duplicate voters exist on the electoral rolls published by the EC on 10 September. He also said that close to 20 lakh voters in Telangana have been deleted from the rolls between 2014 and 2018. ""When we raised the issue with the EC, we were told that the reduction (of 20 lakh voters) was largely due to voter migration from Telangana to Andhra Pradesh following the bifurcation.

Hooda said the victim's family told him that the police had not promptly taken action, giving the key accused a chance to flee. Launching a scathing attack, Surjewala said, ""It is shocking that despite the national concern and loud claims by the state police, the key culprits of the heinous crime are roaming free for four days now."" ""Haryana has become a crime hub under the Khattar government. Official figures prove that crimes against women have increased by 47 percent since the BJP government came to power four years ago,"" the Congress leader alleged. Surjewala claimed 1,413 cases of rape were registered in various police stations between 1 September, 2017, and September 2018 as compared to 1,193 cases between September 2016 and August 2017. The number of rape cases during the same period in 2014-15 and 2015-16 were 961 and 1,026, respectively, he added. Revealing a figure from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, Surjewala said: ""In 2016, the Haryana Police filed chargesheets in only 56.2 percent of cases, which is the second lowest among all states and Union Territories in the country. Such unprofessional attitude and ineffectiveness of the state police encourages the culprits as the national average of filing chargesheets is much higher at 78.1 percent."" Slamming the BJP government, Surjewala said, ""The truth is the state government, which vows to save daughters, has made the state a witness to the most number of rapes and gangrapes."" He said NCRB figures for the year 2016 are available at present as data for the years 2017 and 2018 have not been released yet. ""But Haryana reported 1,090 murders, 1,189 rapes, 191 gangrapes and 4,019 kidnapping and abductions in 2016, which is three murders, three rapes and 11 kidnappings and abductions on an average day. It is a matter of shame that Haryana has got the highest average of gangrape cases in the country now,"" Surjewala added. Meanwhile, in Chandigarh, Khattar, who reviewed with Director General of Police BS Sandhu the  , reiterated that the accused involved in the incident would be given strict punishment as per law. He hoped that they would be nabbed soon. Earlier in the day, the chief minister told reporters in Pathankot that in the case, all the three accused were known to the victim. ""It is most unfortunate when anyone known is involved in such a gruesome and heinous incident. Out of the three accused, one is serving in the army, which is even more unfortunate that such a person is an accused in this case,"" Khattar said. The girl, a school topper hailing from Rewari who had been felicitated by the government, was abducted at a bus stop in Kanina town in neighbouring Mahendragarh district on Wednesday while she was on her way to a coaching class, the police said. She was then allegedly drugged and gangraped at a secluded spot in the fields.",2018-09-17,"Bhupinder Singh Hooda,BJP,Congress,Haryana,Haryana Gangrape,Manohar Lal Khattar,Randeep Singh Surjewala,Rewari Gangrape","After Rewari gangrape, Congress says Haryana has become 'crime hub' under Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP govt",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/after-rewari-gangrape-congress-says-haryana-has-become-crime-hub-under-manohar-lal-khattar-led-bjp-govt-5195341.html,firstpost,-1,0
Asian News International," Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Sunday said that the Congress ruled India for 70 years but failed to give the poor and the backward people their due. Addressing the Other Backward Classes Sammelan, the first rally on day one of his three-day visit to poll-bound Rajasthan, Shah said: ""Congress president Rahul Gandhi's great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, grandmother Indira Gandhi, father Rajiv Gandhi and mother Sonia Gandhi ruled India for 70 years. Yet they did not give the poor and the backward people their due rights."" The BJP chief also accused the Congress of suppressing the backward classes and said that it was the National Democratic Alliance government that passed the backward class commission for the welfare of the concerned section. Shah added that the Congress party wants to keep the illegal immigrants in the country, while the BJP has pledged to weed them out. ""The Congress party wants to keep infiltrators in the country, whereas we have pledged to evict each and every infiltrator from India,"" he said. Shah's remark came on the ongoing controversy on the release of the second and final draft of the National Register of Citizens in Assam, which left out the names of nearly 40 lakh people. Ever since the final draft was released, the Opposition has been cornering the Centre for the exclusion of the applicants from the list. This is the BJP chief's second visit to Rajasthan in a month. On 11 September, he had addressed four programmes in Jaipur.

Press Trust of India,": The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the BJP Friday claimed that the People's Democratic Party (PDP), its erstwhile coalition partner, has lost credibility in the state while its south Kashmir bastion was proving to a 'big minefield'. It also accused former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti of promoting dynastic politics during her tenure besides finding excuses to delay panchayat and local bodies elections. ""South Kashmir considered to be the one-time bastion of the Muftis (Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and his daughter Mehbooba) and PDP is proving to be a big minefield for the party,"" BJP state spokesperson Anil Gupta said in a statement. ""Its leaders are finding it difficult to even visit their constituencies,” he added. ""The party because of its doings in the past three years has lost credibility... The reality is that the party is using Article 35A to emotionally exploit the people of Kashmir and creating a communal wedge under the false notion that it can regain its lost credibility,” Gupta said further. He said there were 'numerous blots' on the political fibre of the PDP which the youth in particular, were 'unwilling to forgive'. As a result, the party has lost the support of the people across the valley. ""Their once vote banks have turned into their worst enemies, a reality which has dawned on its leadership but it is unwilling to accept publicly with grace,"" he said. ""The people find no difference between the mainstream politicians of different parties and view them as self-seekers,” he added. Referring to the boycott of upcoming elections by PDP and its arch rival National Conference (NC), he said it is the ""fear of losing"" and not Article 35 A that has prompted the two parties to boycott the polls. ""Time will never be ripe for PDP to hold urban local bodies and panchayat polls because despite being included in the Agenda of Alliance, which Mehbooba referred to as sacrosanct, she always found one excuse or the other to not hold the elections even after repeated assurances to the then Governor (NN Vohra) and the Home Minister Rajnath Singh,"" he said. He said the former chief minister was more interested in promoting dynastic rule by promoting her brother Tassaduq Hussain and handing over the reins of the party to her uncle. ""The reality is that people have rejected the party blaming it for their outright betrayal. Rather than accepting the ground reality gracefully, PDP leadership in a desperate bid to keep its flock together is trying to take shelter of Article 35A"" he said.",2018-09-14,"Anil Gupta,Article 35a,BJP,Jammu,Kashmir,Mehbooba Mufti,Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,NewsTracker,NN Vohra,PDP,People's Democratic Party,Rajnath Singh,Tassaduq Hussain","BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit claims PDP has lost credibility in state, accuses Mehbooba Mufti of promoting dynastic politics",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjps-jammu-and-kashmir-unit-claims-pdp-has-lost-credibility-in-state-accuses-mehbooba-mufti-of-promoting-dynastic-politics-5186851.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sreemoy Talukdar,"The optics are not looking good for BJP in the Vijay Mallya case. Politics is a game of perception. And as Lee Atwater had said back in the 1980s, perception is reality. In the final scheme of things, it matters little whether scummy bankers arranged easy loans for the debt-ridden liquor baron, whether his misadventures were facilitated by “phone-banking” or whether his NPAs were ‘evergreened’ in the UPA era. It matters little whether a crooked babu looked the other way when Mallya was busy   or whether a corrupt officer gave him a tip-off at the right time. These facts are of academic interest in elections. What matters is a simple ‘story’. The tycoon scooted away when NDA was in power, now claims that he “met” the Union finance minister and “offered to settle the loans” before he did so and the CBI now admits that it “ ” in handling the case. Congress must be licking its chops. The BJP has been pushed to the backfoot, forced to defend itself ahead of elections. The Congress president has wasted no time. He first demanded the resignation of Arun Jaitley. On Friday, he trained his guns on the prime minister. Rahul Gandhi needs to tone down his excitement a wee bit. For all the real and perceived misdemeanors of those he is targeting, Rahul lacks the moral authority to target anyone — much less demand anyone’s resignation — on charges of corruption. Pots usually refrain from labeling a slur on kettles. The BJP, however, should have no comfort on that count. It is struggling to counter the Congress narrative that one of the most powerful ministers in Narendra Modi cabinet ‘helped the disgraced industrialist fly away from India’. In one stroke, Congress charge dilutes the seriousness of the legal battle the Government of India has waged in extraditing Mallya from the UK. It also discredits the reforms NDA has undertaken by bringing in tough laws such as Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to clean up the NPA mess and weakens the impression that the government is ‘tough and uncompromising’ on crony capitalists. Most importantly, it sullies the prime minister’s image of incorruptibility. There’s been a give-and-take between the BJP and Congress on Mallya that makes for little substance but great political theatre. The controversy erupted when the fugitive businessman, who is facing charges of money laundering and an extradition attempt from India, told reporters in London that he had “met” Jaitley before he left for Geneva when he apparently “repeated an offer to settle with the banks”. The finance minister was quick to rebut his claim and clarified in a Facebook post that he had not given Mallya any appointment to meet him since 2014. Jaitley, did, however, reveal that Mallya had “misused his privilege as a Rajya Sabha member” and caught him briefly while the minister was walking out the House to enter his room and made a settlement offer.   “having been fully briefed about his earlier ‘bluff offers’, without allowing him to proceed with the conversation, I curtly told him ‘there was no point talking to me and he must make offers to his bankers.’ I did not even receive the papers that he was holding in his hand.” Mallya’s subsequent clarification, that no formal meeting took place and he “happened to meet Jaitley in Parliament” and had “no formal meeting scheduled with him”  . Congress, however, claims that one of its leaders PL Punia had seen Jaitley talking “discreetly” with Mallya for 15-20 minutes on 1 March, 2016 (a day before he fled) and has demanded Jaitley’s resignation and a “probe”. It is unclear why Punia had kept quiet for so long if he was in possession of such explosive information. Or if he had let it on internally to the party, why Congress chose not to bring it to public notice till now. It is inconceivable that any political party will let go of such an opportunity. It is unlikely, however, for this theatre to provide any specific answers. The more important thing is to try and understand why the CBI changed the 2015 ‘Look Out Circular’ against Mallya from “detain” to “inform” that may have allowed the liquor mogul to escape. This is an interesting angle to explore. As usual, Rahul has jumped the gun and claimed that CBI had “approval” from the prime minister in “quietly” downgrading the notice and leading to Mallya’s “Great Escape”. CBI claims that it changed the Look Out Circular (LOC) from “detain” order against Mallya to “inform” because the “detain” order was unsupported by evidence, backed by no warrants and issued in error. , the CBI sent an LOC request on 16 October, 2015, to immigration authorities asking them to “detain” Mallya upon his arrival from the UK. More than a month later when Mallya was about to land in India, the CBI issued a fresh LOC asking immigration to keep them “informed” instead of detaining Mallya on arrival. The newspaper reports: “CBI realised that if Mallya was detained, he would have to be arrested and they did not have enough evidence to do so.” The report also quotes a CBI officer, as saying, “We were still in the initial stage of the probe. All documents had not been obtained. No bank had approached us with a complaint till then. We believed that Mallya would cooperate better with the probe if he was not arrested.” This obviously means that the first LOC was issued in error. The CBI admits its mistake and insists that there was a slip-up but “no foul play”. The LOC with detention request had “no legal basis as no non-bailable warrant, a requirement under law, had been issued against him (Mallya)”,  , as saying. On why his passport wasn’t impounded despite the lodging of a cheating and criminal conspiracy case against Mallya in July 2015, the report clarifies that “according to a Supreme Court judgement, the passport of a person can only be impounded when he has been charge-sheeted or if a trial is pending against him.” The report also says that a CBI officer had inadvertently ticked the ‘detain’ box during the first LOC and the error was subsequently corrected in the next one. The agency apparently had no reason to suspect that Mallya was flying the coop because he was a frequent flyer abroad with large business interests and was “cooperating” with the probe. For instance, as news agency   has reported, “Mallya travelled abroad in October and returned in November, then made two trips in first and last week of December and also a trip in January 2016. In between, he had appeared for questioning thrice since the look-out notices were issued — once in New Delhi and twice in Mumbai between December 9 and 12, 2015.” The BJP has accused the Congress of flouting all norms to offer a “sweet deal” to Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines to keep the airline afloat during the UPA regime.   bank letters accusing the UPA of restructuring loans to assist Mallya and claimed “it seems the Airlines wasn’t owned by Mallya but by Gandhi family in the proxy. Benefits that Gandhi family got out of Kingfisher Airlines via business class upgradation, free tickets, etc, is in public domain.” Even if one considers these as posturing, the fact remains that former prime minister Manmohan Singh had gone on record in November 2011 to say that his government would try to find ways and means to help  . The airline was deep in crisis by then. In 2017,   purportedly from Mallya written to then finance minister P Chidambaram (dated March 2013) and prime minister Singh (dated October 2011) apparently seeking favours in loan disbursals. Both   that these were “ordinary piece of letters” marking “routine transaction”. Allegations of helping Mallya have been raised directly against Rahul as well. The trouble with Congress’ approach is that it seeks to weaponise a systemic issue with NPAs — dealt at length by    — into a political tool to hunt BJP. While the BJP may have lot to answer for, and indeed appears vulnerable before the narrative of “helping Mallya”, the Congress cannot wield a double-edged sword without injuring itself. This is even more so because the party is helmed by a dynast who is not exactly Ceasar’s wife on corruption. He and his mother Sonia Gandhi are out on bail   and in a recent order, the   challenging the income tax notice seeking a tax reassessment for fiscal 2011-2012. The court has ruled that the I-T department has the power to “reopen tax proceedings”. Incidentally, in August this year, the Delhi HC had rejected Rahul’s plea to restrain the media from reporting on this issue. It raised speculation over why the Congress president, who claims to bat for “freedom of expression” would seek to gag the media. The BJP might be in trouble. Even so, Rahul is hardly the leader who can lead the Congress charge against cronyism. That would be the deepest of ironies.",2018-09-14,"Arun Jaitley,BJP,Congress,Kingfisher Airlines,Manmohan Singh,Narendra Modi,National Herald,NDA,P.

Press Trust of India,"Accusing the BJP of attempting to topple his government, Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Friday warned of legal action against ""certain kingpins' who, he claimed, were trying to bribe Congress and JD(S) MLAs to pull down his ministry. Amid media reports that certain resorts were ready to host some Congress and JD(S) MLAs in the alleged toppling game following internal dissent in the Congress, Kumaraswamy asserted he was ready to face any challenge to his government. ""Whether they keep the resorts or shanties ready, I am ready for everything,"" he told reporters. ""Presently payments are being made in advance. I won't say more now. You will get to know about it later,"" he said. The chief minister alleged that certain ""kingpins"" had been roped in to topple his government. ""Am I not aware of it? Will I keep quiet? Don't I know where the money is being collected and who the kingpins are behind collecting money? I have already initiated measures necessary for legal action. I will take every decision to give a strong and stable government,"" he said. Without mentioning names, Kumaraswamy said that ""these kingpins"" were into gambling, had abetted a coffee planter in killing his wife and son and were those who had set a Bengaluru municipal office on fire nine years ago. These people were collecting money to topple his government, he alleged. Asked why no action has been taken against those trying to ""topple"" the government, Kumaraswamy said he was not at all disturbed by what was going on and felt quite comfortable watching this ""futile exercise"". He also took a jibe at the state BJP for issuing one deadline after the other, predicting the end of the government. ""The next deadline is Monday. Most probably the deadline will extend to 2 October and then to Dasara. I think it will go on extending,"" Kumaraswamy quipped. The BJP trashed the charges, saying that it had never indulged in any such activities. Former deputy  chief minister R Ashok challenged the chief minister to spell out the names of those trying to destabilise the government, instead of using words like ""kingpin"". ""We don't have such intentions and do not want to get into such activities. We will think of forming the government only if it collapses on its own due to internal strife,"" he said. Meanwhile, JDS' coalition partner Congress said it has decided to lodge a complaint with the Income Tax department and Anti-Corruption Bureau, seeking a probe into reports that crores of rupees have changed hands for the toppling game. Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara said ""reports have emerged in the media that Rs 100 crore has been exchanged"". ""Certain reports have stated that this person has taken money... another has received money and speculate that a certain number of people (MLAs) are leaving (the party). So we decided to complain to the Income Tax Department and the state Anti-Corruption Bureau to investigate the veracity of the reports,"" Parameswara said. He dismissed any threat to the coalition government. On Congress MLA Satish Jarkiholi's statement that his brother and minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has his own faction within the party, he accused the media of blowing his statement out of proportion. ""There is no such thing. Yesterday (Thursday) also I made this very clear to HD Devegowda and HD Kumaraswamy when I met them at their homes. I told them that there is no major problem as projected. I reiterate that the government is stable"" Parameshwara said. Congress has been  , triggered by a faction of MLAs led by minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who is locked in a turf war with another minister DK Shivakumar. The Jarkiholi brothers' activities have led to speculations that BJP was fishing in troubled waters and was in touch with them to dislodge the government. The siblings are upset over Shivakumar allegedly trying to challenge their supremacy in Belagavi district through MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar.",2018-09-14,"BJP,BS Yeddyurappa,Congress,G Parameshwara,HD Kumaraswamy,JD(S),Karnataka,TheySaidIt","HD Kumaraswamy accuses BJP of trying to topple his govt, says 'certain kingpins' trying to bribe Congress, JD(S) MLAs",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/hd-kumaraswamy-accuses-bjp-of-trying-to-topple-his-govt-says-certain-kingpins-trying-to-bribe-congress-jds-mlas-5186791.html,firstpost,-1,0
Rahul Satija,"Students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) voted in the Students' Union election 2018 on Friday to elect candidates for the posts of president, vice-president, general secretary and joint secretary. Polling by ballot papers to elect representatives began at 10 am with eight candidates in the contest for the coveted presidential post. The National Student Union of India (NSUI) fielded Vikas Yadav as their presidential candidate while the right-leaning Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) fielded Lalit Pandey. The Left-leaning All India Students’ Association (AISA), Democratic Students Federation (DSF), Student Federation of India (SFI) and All India Students Federation (AISF) have come together to form the United Left Alliance, which has fielded N Sai Balaji as its presidential candidate. The results are expected to be out by Sunday (16 September) morning. In comparison to the Delhi University Student Elections (DUSU), JNUSU elections were conducted in a more peaceful manner. Election day saw a vibrant crowd geared up for polling. Students and cheerleaders showed their support by singing slogans in favour of their favourite candidates and beating drums. “ ”, and “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised by the ABVP supporters. The voter turnout was recorded at 68 percent, with 5,185 votes polled, highest in the last five JNUSU elections. To help create an inclusive election process, the election organising committee at the university ensured that each differently-abled student was accompanied by a person who could help them cast their vote, said Sumit, a committee member. An interesting mechanism was used to assist the visually-impaired in voting. Through a set of headphones, the names of candidates are announced to each visually-challenged person. Once the voter makes a decision, they select their desired candidate on laptop that is embedded with screenreader - a software programme that allows visually-impaired users to read the displayed text on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display. Next, the voter’s choice is printed from the screenreader and entered into the ballot box. A common pattern noticed across the Delhi University and JNU student elections was the mass wastage of paper. While comparatively there was less usage and wastage in JNU, thousands of sheets of paper lay scattered across the ground. This, despite designated cardboard boxes being placed around the campus to collect pamphlets for recycling. Crowds of students started gathering around 9.30am, and the voting process began at 10.00am, which continued till 1.00pm. The second round of voting began at 2.30pm and went on till 5.30pm. Jahnu Kumar Heer, an independent candidate vying for the president’s post, said, “I am working as a one-man army. I am alone distributing pamphlets and campaigning. If I win I would work to improve the situation of all hostels in the university.” With ABVP playing the saffron card, many of its supporters showed up dressed in orange. Raghavendra Mishra, an ABVP supporter pursuing his PhD in Sanskrit, was dressed as a priest. Vivank, an ABVP worker, also turned up to show his support for party candidates, stating, “We want to make this institution world class. One of our party agendas is to inculcate a sense of nationalism among students. And if we win, we would organise such nationalistic programmes.” He also added that the Left wing is against any form of development. Jayant Kumar, who is representing Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in the contest for the presidential post, disagrees that ABVP will succeed. “We have made complete arrangements for the polling day. Our supporters seemed to be very active. We want to throw ABVP ideology out of India. We don't want their ideology to persist.” When asked about what changes he would bring about as president provided he gets elected, Kumar said that they want to uplift all minority groups and help them out through the new admission process. “Due to the UGC guidelines that were introduced last year, the admission process gives more weightage to Viva now.” Unlike earlier, where maximum weightage was given to the entrance exam as compared to viva-voce, the former is merely a procedure to qualify, while most importance is given to the viva. This, Kumar says, creates a hindrance for minority groups. “It is difficult for students who belong to the backward community or are poor to perform well in viva. We want the viva contribution for the selection procedure to be reduced to 30 percent.” Confident of his victory, ABVP’s Lalit Pandey said after their party wins, they would make arrangements for new hostels, renovate existing ones, and incorporate compulsory attendance. Students alleged that ABVP tried to influence voters through bribes. Udita, a student of JNU’s School of Social Sciences, said, “ABVP gave treats at nearby restaurants and they also took students to a movie in order to influence their votes.” Govind Dangi of ABVP, who is contesting for the post of the counsellor at School of International Studies, denied claims that the Parishad was bribing student voters. In view of the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, JNUSU elections are vital in the political scenario of the nation. Requesting anonymity, some JNU students opined that JNU is the core of youth politics and since many young leaders from JNU are currently contributing to national politics, the varsity election would also set the tone for ensuing Lok Sabha election. National media convener of ABVP, Monika Chaudhary, however, believes the impact of JNUSU polls on Lok Sabha polls could at most be indirect, if any. “If the Left wing is raising agenda of arrest of Left activists in JNUSU polls, it proves that Left unity is in favour of Urban naxalism,” she had said. Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association (BAPSA), which raised issues of the students belonging to marginalized groups in JNUSU 2018, could also play a vital role in cutting votes, as it is considered an alternative of the Left and Right Wing.

Press Trust of India,"A day after a court in Maharashtra  against him, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday said he did nothing wrong and had only tried to protect the interests of north Telangana by opposing the Babli project on the Godavari. Hitting out at the BJP, Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) KE Krishna Murthy said the saffron party was foisting cases against Naidu as part of a ""political conspiracy."" The judicial first class magistrate of Dharmabad in Nanded district, NR Gajbhiye, had issued the order against Naidu and 15 others in a 2010 case related to an agitation by them over the Babli project.

He said Maharashtra Police deliberately arrested him and other TDP leaders on the (then united Andhra Pradesh) border when they went to protest against the Babli construction.

Press Trust of India," The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will be compelled to go it alone if it does not get a ""respectable"" number of seats in the anti-BJP alliance that is shaping up before the Lok Sabha 2019 polls, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said Sunday. The BSP chief also said that instances of mob lynching in the name of cow protection were a ""blot on democracy"" and accused BJP governments in various states of being indifferent to the problem. At a press conference, held for the first time in her new accommodation in Lucknow after she was forced to vacate her sprawling bungalow on Supreme Court orders, Mayawati made clear her party might be compelled to go it alone if it does not get a ""respectable number"" of seats in the anti-BJP alliance. ""Our party is not against the alliance, but our stand is very clear that we will ally with a political party only if we get a respectable share of seats. Otherwise, our party feels it better to contest the elections alone,"" she said. On the Lok Sabha 2019 elections and the upcoming Assembly elections in certain states, Mayawati said, the effort of the Opposition parties will be to stop the BJP from coming to power at any cost. Maywati targeted the BJP claiming that its governments in the Centre and states had ""worsened"" the condition of the people by showing them false dreams.  ""These governments have done no good to people barring a few industrialists,"" she alleged adding that ""both the NDA and the previous UPA governments were equally responsible for shielding the corrupt"". Mayawati also said the ""increasing tendency"" of mobs indulging in lynching in the name of cow protection in the ""BJP-ruled states"" was a blot on democracy. Yet the governments (in these states) are exercising laxity and are being indifferent to it, she claimed. ""These activities of the BJP governments against the Dalits, Tribals, backwards, Muslims and Christians are going on from their inception and are a result of the party's intention to go against the Constitution...This has been part of the basic policy of the BJP, which has assumed alarming proportions after they came to power,"" she alleged. Continuing her attack on the BJP, Mayawati claimed that the party after forming the government was trying to crush the democratic movements and resorting to ""terror tactics"" in this regard. ""After the 2 April 'Bharat Bandh' called by Dalit organisations, atrocities are going on,"" she alleged. Accusing the BJP of resorting to ""diversionary tactics"" as Lok Sabha elections were approaching, Mayawati said the saffron party was not leaving any stone unturned to ""derive advantage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee"". ""As the Lok Sabha elections and Assembly elections are approaching in certain states, the BJP is resorting to different tactics to hide its failures and is making lucrative announcements. In this matter, they (BJP) are not leaving any stone unturned to derive advantage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They never followed his footsteps, when he was alive,"" she alleged. ""If Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP followed the footsteps of Vajpayee and ran the government accordingly, there would not have been religious frenzy and communal incidents. Nor there would have been the rule of mobocracy,"" she claimed. ""People know the campaign undertaken by the BJP and RSS in the name of Vajpayee is an attempt to hide failures,"" she said continuing her attack. ""The BJP will not get any benefit from this,"" she added. ""The people of the country now understand that none of the election promises made in Lok Sabha 2014 elections was fulfilled,""  she said. Mayawati also alleged that the Centre was not able to come clean on the Rafale deal. Referring to demonetisation, Mayawati said it was done in an unplanned manner leading to a ""financial emergency"". The BJP government should now at least tender an apology over the ""national tragedy"", she said. On the possibility of misuse of SC/ST Act, Mayawati said, ""The BSP is of the view that if the current state governments follow the 'Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay' policy of her party, there will be no misuse of this law.""",2018-09-16,"Assembly Elections,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Bahujan Samaj Party,Bharatiya Janata Party,BJP,BSP,Cow Vigilantism,Dalits,Demonetisation,Lok Sabha 2019 Polls,LUCKNOW,Mayawati,Mobocracy,NDA,NewsTracker,SC/ST Act,Supreme Court,Tribals,UPA,Uttar Pradesh","BSP to contest alone in Lok Sabha 2019 polls if party does not get 'respectable' seat share in anti-BJP alliance, says Mayawati",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bsp-to-contest-alone-in-lok-sabha-2019-polls-if-party-does-not-get-respectable-seat-share-in-anti-bjp-alliance-says-mayawati-5195371.html,firstpost,-1,0
Debobrat Ghose,"While the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rose to national prominence riding on the hopes of a young India determined to fight against corruption, its core constituency seems to have lost faith in it. The party's student union, the Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS) has been   in the recently-concluded Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) elections. AAP, the party that came to power in Delhi registering a historical victory by bagging 67 out of 70 seats in the 2015 Assembly election, is finding it difficult to find favour with students. Born out of the ‘India Against Corruption’ (IAC) movement, the AAP virtually revolutionised the political scenario in Delhi and succeeded in coming to power by defeating the BJP and the Congress. It was then expected that its students’ wing CYSS, which had participated in the DUSU election for the first time in 2015, would again create history by winning the students’ union election. However, this did not happen. In fact, it was routed in its debut election and secured third and fourth positions. The CYSS remained in hibernation for two years and contested this year by allying with the All India Students’ Association (AISA) – the students’ wing of the CPI (M-L). It again failed to make any dent in the Opposition camp. Eyeing the 2015 DUSU election, the AAP had launched its students’ wing in a big way on 27 September, 2014. Several volunteers and youth who had been associated with the IAC movement and later with the AAP, feel that a gradual depletion of values and principles in the AAP has had a cascading effect on CYSS. “When the AAP got a historical victory in 2015, the party represented hope and a national alternative. Today, the party or its students’ wing – CYSS — is merely one of the many options available like NSUI, ABVP, etc, because of a serious lack of basic moral values and principles. The DUSU elections show that when CYSS too starts depending on money, muscle and machinery to win elections, it can’t beat the traditional opponents at their own game,” Swaraj India’s Delhi president, Anupam told  . Anupam had been a part of AAP from its initial days and moved out along with Yogendra Yadav to form the Swaraj Abhiyan. Later, he became a part of the newly-made political party Swaraj India. Following are some of the factors behind the failure of the CYSS — 
-Neglect of youth power. 
-Failure to strengthen youth and students’ wing. 
-Failure in strategy to fight DUSU election. 
-AAP’s changed priorities after coming to power. 
-Unlike the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), CYSS lacks a strong organisational structure. 
-Dent in the image of AAP and its supremo Arvind Kejriwal. 
-Fading of AAP’s ""revolutionary"" image. 
-AAP’s shift from its core vote bank — youth — to others. 
-Frustration among youth and students. 
-Joining hands with AISA. According to an AAP functionary, the CYSS jumped into the fray quite late and joined hands with the AISA towards the end of August. This reflects poor strategy on the part of AAP. “Initially, Arvind Kejriwal’s personality evoked idealism and attracted youth. But his image was dented when he and AAP indulged in power politics. Students and youth are more attracted to idealism and think of bringing change. Unfortunately, AAP failed to build upon on this factor. Therefore, students in campuses are unable to connect with CYSS today,” said Karan Singh, former head of AAP volunteers. “Youth have been the core strength of AAP, but after the party came to power, they were neglected. We raised this issue a couple of times during our meetings, but it remained unheard. Unlike the ABVP, CYSS lacks a strong organisational structure. It was only after dabbling with power politics and money that the AAP realised that it needs to strengthen its students’ wing. But it was too late,” alleged Singh. The CYSS performed well in Rajasthan in 2017, when it had won 28 posts in students’ union elections, out of which 12 posts were those of presidents. However, Delhi’s story is different, with heavyweights like ABVP and NSUI as strong opponents. “Delhi University and JNU represent the entire country and not just a state. The CYSS has no influence on college and university campuses in Delhi. The root cause is the AAP, as youth are unable to associate with the party any more,” Singh added. Many students and members of CYSS feel that the alliance with AISA was an important reason for the failure. “Instead of joining hands with AISA, we should have strengthened ourselves independently. If AAP got the historic mandate by not joining hands with any other party, why couldn't CYSS do it? This alliance left a large number of students confused, as they did not want to be a part of any Left-backed union. The CYSS should have been developed into a strong independent students’ union,” a CYSS member and DU student said on the condition of anonymity.",2018-09-14,"Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,ABVP,Arvind Kejriwal,CYSS,Delhi,Delhi University,DUSU Elections 2018,DUSU Polls 2018,NSUI,PoliticalPlay",DUSU Election 2018: AAP-backed CYSS faces electoral rout; former volunteers pin blame on depletion of values in party,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/dusu-election-2018-aap-backed-cyss-faces-electoral-rout-former-volunteers-pin-blame-on-depletion-of-values-in-party-5186881.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," The war of words between the BJP and the Congress over the Vijay Mallya issue intensified Friday with the Opposition party alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""silence"" was an admission of guilt and the ruling party questioning links between the fugitive tycoon and the Gandhi family. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley helped the liquor baron flee India and accused them of maintaining a ""conspiratorial silence"" about a ""meeting"" Jaitley had with the defaulter businessman on 1 March, 2016. Holding that Jaitley has lost the legal, ethical and moral right to continue as minister and must resign, he said the silence of the Union minister and Modi pointed at their admission of guilt. Hitting back, the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) media head Anil Baluni fired off eight questions to the Congress. He asked if its president Rahul Gandhi and his mother and predecessor Sonia Gandhi did not fly free of cost in Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines in lieu of loans given to it. It was the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government which ""raised and protected"" the fugitive tycoon, he said, claiming that Rahul Gandhi suffers from ""ideological bankruptcy and does not know what he says, does and understands"". ""Why Rahul Gandhi does not answer these questions? Why his lips are sealed when faced with these burning questions. What can be a bigger evidence of corruption than the fact that it was the Congress government which raised and protected Mallya,"" he said. At his press conference, Surjewala asked why Modi was ""afraid"" to conduct a fair investigation in this matter. ""It shows that Prime Minister Modi is not just a part of this crime but the main culprit,"" he said. If Modi does not act, it will be proved that the 'chowkidaar' (watchman) is not just a 'Bhaagidaar' (partner) but is guilty of protecting a criminal, the Congress leader alleged. ""Multiple skeletons are tumbling out of the Modi government's cupboard unravelling a sinister conspiracy and collusion of government agencies, including CBI, ED, SFIO and others in permitting Vijay Mallya to escape the clutches of law,"" he told reporters. In his statement, Baluni cited the then-prime minister Manmohan Singh's reported comments in 2011 that Kingfisher Airlines, now defunct, needed to be helped and asked if it was not true that the then finance minister P Chidambaram ignored rules to provide relief to the loss-making airline. ""Is it not true that in exchange for providing (bank) loans to Mallya the then UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and current Congress president Rahul Gandhi travelled free of cost in the airline's business class,"" he asked. He also repeated several allegations the ruling party has been levelling at the Congress. The two parties have been training guns at each other after Mallya claimed Wednesday in London that he had met Jaitley before leaving India. The finance minister refuted his claim, saying he had never give him an appointment but the businessman misused his privilege as a member of Parliament to accost him there but he asked him to approach his banker.

FP Staff,"Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who was admitted to a hospital in Candolim on Thursday, will be moved to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for further treatment on Saturday. According to reports, Parrikar has expressed his desire to give up the chief ministerial position temporarily, owing to his declining health.  reported that he spoke to BJP chief Amit Shah and conveyed his inability to work normally. To reduce his work burden, portfolios will be distributed among the existing ministers, said Deputy Speaker Michael Lobo on Saturday. ""Portfolios would be distributed today (Saturday) to existing ministers so that the administration of Goa can run smoothly and ministers can take decisions on any files. He will distribute 48 portfolios, but will keep two or three like Home, Finance, GAD for himself,"" Lobo told reporters after meeting Parrikar at a private hospital in the beach village of Candolim. Lobo also said, that the decision of change of leadership has not been taken yet and that Parrikar would continue as the chief minister. Earlier on Thursday, Parrikar, who returned from the US after medical check-up on 7 September, was admitted to a private hospital at Candolim in North Goa district. The Goa chief minister has been suffering from a pancreatic ailment  for the last seven months. A central team of Bharatiya Janata Party observers is also expected to arrive in Goa and meet legislators and representatives of allied parties, while also finalising an alternative leader of the BJP-led coalition government in Parrikar's absence. Earlier this year, he was admitted to a hospital in the US for nearly three months. Since his return last week, Parrikar has not attended any official meetings. CMO officials had said he was clearing files from home and would start attending meetings and functions after Ganesh Chaturthi. However, the festival which began Thursday, is over. In the backdrop of his hospitalisation, the Goa BJP held a meeting of its state-level core committee on Friday. While the party did not reveal details of the meeting, a participant, on condition of anonymity, told   it was a ""general meeting"" which discussed the ""existing political situation"" in Goa. The party's core committee, which met at Mapusa, comprised three Members of Parliament from the state (two Lok Sabha and one Rajya Sabha) as well as senior leaders.

FP Staff,"Amid the ongoing controversy of liquor baron Vijay Mallya's escape from the country, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday took a jab a the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has come under harsh light after it emerged that the probe body had ""diluted"" Mallya's lookout notice in 2015. In a tweet, the Congress scion said that CBI Joint Director Arun Kumar Sharma weakened Mallya's lookout notice, allowing the fugitive tycoon to escape arrest in India. He also said, ""Mr Sharma, a Gujarat cadre officer, is the PM’s blue-eyed-boy in the CBI."" Gandhi was referring to a report by  published a day earlier, where CBI sources said that it was Sharma who had ordered the dilution of the lookout notice from ""detain"" to ""inform"" on 24 November, 2015, without prior intimation to the then-CBI director Anil Sinha. Sinha came to know about the change in the lookout notice on 2 March, 2016, the day Mallya fled the country. Incidentally, Sharma is now heading the CBI investigation into the Rs 11,400 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, involving businessmen Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, both of whom are absconding as well. Taking a dig at it, Gandhi said that Sharma was ""in-charge of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi’s escape plans. Oops... investigation!"" As per the  report, Sharma broke the rules by downgrading the lookout notice in a Rs 9,000 crore case without seeking the CBI director's permission. The rules state that a joint director can take decisions in scams upto to Rs 60 crores only. Sharma, a Gujarat cadre officer, was previously Joint Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad Crime Branch, and is known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, reported  He is an India Police Service officer from the 1987 batch whose name featured in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case where he was allegedly present in a meeting along with other officers for “derailing the investigation"", as per an  . The   (vide DPBSM/2015/724/RCNSM 2015 E 0006) against Mallya on 16 October 2015. The circular had asked immigration authorities to detain Mallya and report the same to CBI. However, a second lookout circular (vide letter number 1049/RCBSM/2015/E0006) was then issued on CBI’s request, on 24 November 2015, asking immigration authorities to merely inform the agency about Mallya’s arrival at the airport. Meanwhile, the CBI on Thursday said that the change in the lookout notice was an   because he was cooperating in the probe and there was no warrant against him. A   report quoted CBI sources as saying that the agency did not try to stop Mallya's movement abroad as he had been cooperating in the investigation by presenting himself for questioning as and when required and also providing the required documents. The   report also pointed out that, according to a Supreme Court judgment passport of a person can only be impounded when he/she has been charged or a trial is pending against them.

Rashme Sehgal,"Following the UPA government's defeat in 2014 Lok Sabha polls, a number of its leaders have taken to writing and come out with a spate of books. Former minister and senior politician Kapil Sibal recently released   in which he minutely examined the claims the Narendra Modi government made during its 2014 election campaign and how it has failed to meet any of them. The book also looks at the gap between the promises and what he has delivered on the ground. Sibal talks about the book and more in an interview. Edited excerpts: This is not meant to be a Congress manifesto. The purpose of writing this book is two-fold. At a political level, there is a need to analyse the policies of this government while at an individual level it is an attempt to highlight what the prime minister (Modi) stands for, supported by data. This data can be used by the Congress party. The book is an analysis of the missteps of both the prime minister and his government. I also want to show that I do not make allegations — as was done by Modi during the election campaign of 2014 — which are unsupported by facts. It all started with CAG and the figure of Rs 1.76 lakh crore (figure given by the then CAG chairman Vinod Rai about the presumptive loss caused to the treasury by the telecom scam). The figure was just lapped up by the media. No investigation was done by the media as to how he had arrived at this sum. We came up with our defence but no one was prepared to listen to us. And then, of course, the courts entered the fray and gave a judgement which was unsupported by facts. We offered an explanation but no one was willing to listen. The media no longer remains the only vehicle of perception. When a person driving a scooter goes to a petrol pump and buys petrol at Rs 90 per litre, the message need not be sent through the electronic media. This is a government that cannot provide healthcare to the people. The Lancet study has shown that largest number of women suicides in the world is taking place in India. Young people are not getting jobs. Everyone remembers the two crore jobs per annum he (Modi) promised during his election campaign. The electronic revolution was used by him to win the election. That same electronic revolution is going to prove to be his downfall in 2019. He succeeded in winning elections when the Opposition was not united. That is how he won Uttar Pradesh. In 2014, he would not have won if the Opposition had been united. Do not forget that he got only 31 percent of the vote. You saw how a united election (Opposition) won the Phulpur, Kirana and Gorakhpur bye-elections. Yes, but the Congress has no presence in UP and a lot will depend on former chief minister Mayawati. In fact, she even issued a statement recently on this, didn't she? 
Mayawati has not said anything on this. The Congress has now entered into an understanding with TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu for the forthcoming Telangana elections. There is anti-incumbency factor against K Chandrashekar Rao and Naidu does enjoys some support in Telangana. The impossible is going to become the possible. Everybody is sick of this regime. They are autocratic, intolerant and they persecute people. The Income Tax department, the ED, the CBI are being used to suit their own political ends. Their governors are partisan. Look at the functioning of the HRD Ministry and how the NCERT has gone about changing textbooks and introduced heroes who have never been heard of. Even the Statue of Unity is being built using Chinese steel. So much for their Made in India claims. Look at the scams around them. The Birla Diaries, the Sahara Diaries, the Chattisgarh Diaries, the Vyapam scam — none of which have been investigated. They are using these investigative agencies to target others even as they protect themselves. Look at how the government formation took place in Goa and in the North East. The people of Madhya Pradesh are extremely unhappy with the present government. The members of the Congress party must come together to ensure that they convert this disgruntlement into votes. There are scams erupting every day in that state. Their inability to govern. They are simply not able to think far enough and take decisions that are in the country’s interest. Demonetisation has been the biggest policy blunder of the Modi government. It was taken to make a splash and he is going to drown in that. More than one hundred people died as a result of demonetisation. I want to ask in which other country in the world would the prime minister have survived this? A flawed GST without understanding realities on the ground is also a classic example of over-regulation. I have been told by many exporters that the present GST regime has so many hurdles in respect to exports which the government needs to sort out. Modi’s foreign policy has also been a disaster. He’s literally a fly away (from the country) prime minister. There was peace and tranquillity with our neighbours in 2014 and look at what has happened now. After declining the joint military exercise with India, the Nepal army chief has gone a step further and declined Indian army chief’s invite to attend the BIMSTEC conclave and here we have our defence minister saying there is nothing to be worried about. Or take our relations with China. I have highlighted in my book how the UPA government had been blamed for extending a hand of friendship to the Chinese especially when they were not willing to relent on issues regarding our border state of Arunachal Pradesh. Foreign minister (Sushma Swaraj) rightly told the Parliament that patience was the key to resolving the stand off. But the reality is that by January 2018, almost five months after India and China agreed to end their standoff, Beijing has taken control of the northern side of the disputed plateau. The fact is that the prime minister and the PMO have been sidelining the defence minister as was also seen in the Rafale deal with France. In the same way, the PMO has sidelined both the defence minister and the finance minister. Can you run a country of 1.3 billion in this manner? This has really been his biggest failure. And let me tell you that he talked about a policy paralysis but the same policy paralysis saw an 8.2 per cent increase in GDP. We now have a strong leader and our GDP is down to seven percent. Absolutely. He has recently changed the governor but the key players in Kashmir, both the National Conference and the PDP have announced they are boycotting the panchayat polls and have refused to collaborate with the government. The Nirbhaya (Jyoti Singh) case saw the UPA become the target of public wrath with candlelight marches being held against the mishandling of this case. But Modi has failed to put in place an institutional framework for reducing crimes against women. Look at the recent incidents of the brutal murder of a Dalit girl in Jind and the murder of an 11-year old girl in Panipat none of which evoked such reactions. Or, take the case of (UP chief minister) Yogi Adityanath’s MLA Kuldeep Sengar being booked for raping a minor girl. His government left no stone unturned in an attempt to shield the accused. And now, we have the spectacle of Adityanath not granting sanction for his own prosecution. He also wants 131 cases against those accused in the 2013 communal riots to be withdrawn. How come the media is keeping silent about all this? You can criticise us for having a democratic impulse. There was a conspiracy, a coalition of conspiracies whose key aim was to bring down our government. We even set up a committee in the spirit of democracy but what has happened in the last four-and-a-half years? The BJP government has chosen to the put the Lokpal and the Lokayuktas Act 2013 on the backburner. Questions need to be asked about who was funding the people who gathered at the Ramlila Maidan, who was bringing them lunch and dinner, and who was paying for that media coverage? The presumptive loss figure on the coal scam by CAG was put at Rs 1.86 lakh crore. The logic of the CAG was based on the government’s decision not to auction 194 coal blocks between 2004 and 2011 thereby suggesting that the country had lost a massive amount of revenue. The Supreme Court’s judgment in 2014 cancelling the entire chain of allocation of coal blocks from 1993-2012 has wreaked havoc on the economy. Deallocating coal mines has impacted the availability of coal. Worse, loans to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh crore given by banks to companies that were allotted to coal mines have become NPAs apart from causing a loss of Rs 4.4 lakh crore in terms of royalty, cess, direct and indirect taxes and today we are importing coal at very high prices. The special CBI judge (OP Saini) did not find a shred of evidence against the accused in the 2G scam. The trial court judgment should make us think of the dangers that present themselves when the Supreme Court entertains PILs in a surcharged atmosphere and seeks to render findings without a full-fledged trial. We have had to pay a huge economic cost for this judicial activism. I believe, in matters of economics, the court should stay their hand. There are a lot of new technologies which are going to be used. The reason why the government is pushing for the Aadhar card is so that it can target data for each individual. But none of this individual streaming of data is going to make an impact because no one is going to follow this piped piper in 2019.",2018-09-15,"2019 Polls,Arunachal Pradesh,BJP,CAG,CBI,Coal Scam,Congress,Dalit,Demonetisation,ED,France,Fuel Prices,GDP,GST,Jammu And Kashmir,Jyoti Singh Case,Kapil Sibbal,Lokpal Act,Lokyuktas Act 2013,Modi,Narendra Modi,National Conference,NC,NDA,PDP,Rafale Deal,Shades Of Truth-A Journey Derailed,Telangana,TheySaidIt,UPA,Uttar Pradesh,Vinod Rai,Yogi Adityanath","Kapil Sibal says 'pied piper' Modi's biggest failure is inability to govern, 'coalition of conspiracies' brought down UPA in 2014",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/kapil-sibal-says-pied-piper-modis-biggest-failure-is-inability-to-govern-coalition-of-conspiracies-brought-down-upa-in-2014-5188321.html,firstpost,-1,0
Indo-Asian News Service," The Congress alleged on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were conspiring to remove the memories of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and the people of the country will teach them a lesson.

The Allahabad Development Authority said the statue was placed in a park on the same road. Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that even by removing his statue, they would not be able to remove the memories of Nehru and others connected with the freedom struggle from the minds of the people.

He and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister want to remove all memories of Jawaharlal Nehru in the development of independent India and the freedom struggle,"" he said. Surjewala said Allahabad has been the work place of Nehru as well as of the Congress which started its independence march from there. ""Modi   and Yogi   are conspiring by trying to tarnish this memory of Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel,"" the Congress leader alleged. ""By removing a statue from outside Allahabad's Anand Bhawan, Modi will not be able to remove Nehru from the minds and hearts of people. Whatever steps you may take, the people of India have a bigger heart and will teach Modi and Adityanath a lesson,"" the Congress leader claimed. Party leader Ajay Maken said it was unfortunate that statues of national leaders were being removed and that Nehru was not only a Congress leader, he was the counrty's first prime minister and he deserved respect from every political party and all citizens. He recalled that the BJP leaders fondly circulate the speech of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, where, he as the external affairs minister in 1977, ensured that Nehru's portrait was put back when it was removed at that time. ""So, I would like to remind them again that Nehru was not only a Congress leader... but, more than that, he was a national icon,"" he said. Maken said Nehru was a great freedom fighter who had fought for the country's Independence and was imprisoned for 10 -11 years in various jails. ""So, Nehru is more than a Congress man. He belongs to every man and we should give him due respect,"" Maken told reporters.",2018-09-14,"Allahabad,Anand Bhawan,Congress,Jawaharlal Nehru,NewsTracker,Randeep Surjewala",Nehru's statue removed from intersection in Allahabad for road widening project; Congress slams Yogi Adityanath,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/nehrus-statue-removed-from-intersection-in-allahabad-for-road-widening-project-congress-slams-yogi-adityanath-5187391.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India,"Mizoram home minister R Lalzirliana on Friday tendered his resignation from the Lal Thanhawla cabinet, officials in the Chief Minister's Office said. Lalzirliana said he has not resigned from the primary membership of the party. His resignation brings to the fore the internal squabbles in the ruling Congress before the state Assembly elections, due in December. He said he had to resign as he could not fulfill the aspirations of the people of his Tawi constituency as the Lal Thanhawla government refused to create a separate Saitual district even after promising the people to do so. Lalzirliana, who is also the Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president, was served a show cause notice by the party's disciplinary committee on Tuesday asking for his explanation on why disciplinary action should not be taken against him in the wake of news reports which claimed he was joining the Opposition Mizo National Front (MNF). His resignation is most likely to be accepted, sources in the ruling Congress said. Lalzirliana, accompanied by his supporters submitted his resignation to Lal Tahnhawla's principal secretary Lalramthanga as the chief minister is away, sources said. He was given time till 3 pm Friday to furnish his explanation, which Lalzirliana refused to do and announced his resignation to the Congress party workers at the weekly political session held at the Congress Bhavan. During the meeting, which was held earlier in the day, he hinted that there was conspiracy to remove him as vice-president of the MPCC as well as from the post of the minister. ""I have no intention to explain and reply to the show cause notice as there is no need to do so,"" he said. He claimed that Congress president Rahul Gandhi during the 2008 Assembly election had even promised the people of his constituency that Saitual district would be created if he (Lalzirliana) was elected. Lalzirliana had first won the then Saitul Assembly constituency, now Tawi seat, in 1998 when the Congress was completely routed by the MNF-Mizoram People's Conference combine. He was among the six Congress legislators in the 40-member house and the only one from Aizawl district. He won from his home turf for four consecutive terms and was inducted as minister in 2008 when the Congress stormed back to power.

Saurabh Sharma," The Uttar Pradesh government in the wee hours of 14 September   Chandrashekhar Azad, alias Ravan, from prison. His jail term was due to end on 1 November. He was jailed under the National Security Act (NSA) in connection with the Saharanpur riots of May 2017, in which clashes between Thakurs and Scheduled Castes had left 16 injured and one dead. A signboard that reads ‘The Great Chamar’ erected outside Ghadkoli village is believed to be the initial feud, with the Thakur’s objecting to it but the Bhim Army having its way, which led from one event to another resulting in  . Chandrashekhar was arrested in June, 2017, from Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh. The Scheduled Caste community in Uttar Pradesh was unhappy with the action taken by the police and government, which gradually led to mass scale conversions to Buddhism in Saharanpur and the community maintaining an arm’s distance from the BJP. Chandrashekhar, 30, who hails from Shabbirpur village in Saharanpur, founded the Bhim Army Ekta Mission in 2015 to counter the dominant Thakurs’ influence in the district. The organisation claims to have more than 40,000 members across seven states, including Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. Two other persons — Sonu and Shivkumar — who were in jail in connection with the riots, were also released on Friday, as per a government order. The state government decided to release Chandrashekhar on grounds of sympathy, due to his mother’s health, it states. After his release around 2.30 am on Friday, Chandrashekhar told mediapersons that he will continue his fight against the oppressive government in the state and strengthen the mahagathbandhan. He also said that the government could not prove any charge against him under the NSA and thus have released him before the next hearing in the case. After the Saharanpur riots, the Bhim Army had garnered the support of Scheduled Castes across the country, particularly in states like Haryana, Uttarakhand and Punjab, as several protests were held demanding Chandrashekhar’s release. Post the Saharanpur riots, the impact of the Scheduled Caste community distancing itself from the BJP was seen to such an extent that despite the latter winning 312 out of 403 seats in the 2017 Assembly elections, the party lost both Kairana Lok Sabha and the Noorpur Assembly seats when bypolls took place in May, 2018. One of the main reasons behind the BJP’s defeat is believed to be the Bhim Army extending its support to the Opposition (Congress + BSP + SP+ RLD) candidate Tabassum Hasan. Adding fuel to the fire, the police arrested multiple protesters, including minors, in connection with the violence that took place during April’s Bharat Bandh. This further pushed away an already estranged community. In this background, it seems like the BJP is going to try hard to reach out to the community. According to documentary filmmaker Nakul Singh Sawhney, who has been documenting atrocities on Scheduled Castes in Saharanpur, it is a win for the movement for the community's rights. “Ravan is the voice of the movement for the rights of the Scheduled Caste community in India, and not just in Uttar Pradesh or Saharanpur,” says Sawhney. That Ravan had been a constant voice bringing to light atrocities committed against the community did not go down well with the government, and they unconstitutionally imposed the NSA on him, says Sawhney. The move to release him is not out of sympathy, but out of pressure from the Scheduled Caste community which has been protesting against Ravan’s arrest, Sawhney adds. Manjit Nautiyal, the national spokesperson of the Bhim Army, welcomed the decision, while also adding that they will not allow the BJP to use the issue for electoral gains in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. “We extend our thanks, but if this has been done to woo the Scheduled Castes, then we are not going to let it happen,” says Nautiyal, adding that the community will continue the struggle until they are treated equally. The government’s move to release Chandrashekhar before his jail term ends could also be an attempt of the BJP to break the Scheduled Caste vote bank, which has so far supported Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh. Chandrashekhar has in the past voiced his dissatisfaction with the BSP supremo while praising party founder Kanshi Ram in the same breath. Votes from Scheduled Castes in Uttar Pradesh have been under the firm grip of Mayawati, which was evident with the mandate of the Phoolpur and Gorakhpur by-elections, where the SP-BSP alliance vanquished an over-confident BJP. However, according to activist from the community and former IPS officer SR Darapuri, Mayawati has been opposing the Bhim Army, and has once even said that Chandrashekhar is a product of the RSS. “So, this move makes it very clear that Ravan will come out as a competitor of Mayawati and will downplay her,” he says. To break it down, the BJP has made a calculated move to sway the votes of Scheduled Castes in its favour in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, it remains to be seen if voters from the community will align with the saffron party. Chandrashekhar enjoys the staunch support of youth from the community, which can be utilised against the BSP in the upcoming election.",2018-09-15,"BJP,BSP,Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan,ConnectTheDots,Mahagathbandhan,Mayawati,Nakul Singh Sawhney,National Security Act,Saharanpur Riots,Scheduled Castes,Uttar Pradesh",UP govt's decision to release Bhim Army chief early may be part of strategy to wean SC community away from BSP,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/up-govts-move-to-release-bhim-army-chief-chandrashekar-azad-early-may-be-strategy-to-pull-sc-community-from-bsp-5181631.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Congress president Rahul Gandhi is likely to launch his party's election campaign in poll-bound Chhattisgarh in early October and the process of screening candidates for the Assembly polls would be over by September-end, state Congress leaders said. This decision was taken at a meeting of top party leaders from the state with Rahul at his residence. The Congress chief also asked them to hold parleys with states of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for possible tie-up in the state. Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel said the state Congress has given a proposal to the party chief to start the party's poll campaign formally sometime in the first and second week of October. ""The state Congress has given its proposal but the exact dates will be decided by the party high command and the Congress president. The campaign will be in three phases,"" he said. He also said the screening committee of the party, for the first time, is visiting each district to select candidates and hold discussions with leaders at the grassroots level.

FP Staff,"Counting for Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) elections was suspended on Thursday due to technical faults in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and following protests by students. The process has now been resumed. DUSU election officer had confirmed that the counting for the polls to four DUSU posts, which was held on Wednesday, was suspended after four EVMs were found to be faulty. He further cited the students' protest over the issue at the counting centre as the reason behind poll panel's decision to suspend counting. ""We had proposed rectification of the faulty EVMs and resumption of the counting but the students were not ready for it. It was decided to suspend counting. A fresh date for the counting will be announced soon,"" an election officer for DUSU polls told  . Earlier, the counting, which was supposed to begin at 8.30 am on Thursday, had started with a delay of around 80 minutes due to unexplained reasons. The first EVM glitch was spotted at around 11 am, following which the counting was halted for over 50 minutes. Polling officials said that the display of the EVM was not responding, hence, so they had to wait for a new display to be sent to the community centre in New Delhi's Kingsway Camp, where the counting was underway. However, soon after the counting resumed, there were reports of four more EVMs developing a snag. One EVM which malfunctioned showed a strange error. The machine reportedly recorded 40 votes in favour of ballot number 10, which was vacant. Neither a candidate, nor the option NOTA (None of the above) was listed against that number. Following this, the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) alleged that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) students rigged the polling machine. NSUI supporters surrounded the counting centre and started raising slogans. They were held back by police barricades, thanks to the heavy presence of security forces at the venue. 
Meanwhile, ABVP candidates want the counting to continue, a move which is being resisted by other student organisations. ABVP's vice-presidential candidate Shakti Singh said, ""Only one EVM was faulty and it can be repaired. We want the counting to be resumed. Since we were leading on all the seats, the other parties are demanding fresh elections."" Following allegations of rigging, the Election Commission asked the candidates of all parties to sign an agreement for recounting of votes. However, the move has met with some resistance. While the ABVP has agreed to sign the agreement, NSUI has demanded that the faulty EVMs be repaired before they agree to a recount. At the time of filing this report, the impasse continued. However, the poll panel is expected to give the final word by evening. Soon after the controversy broke out, the Aam Aadmi Party, whose student wing the Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS) had allied with left-leaning students' outfit All India Students Association (AISA) in polls,  held a press conference. Party leader Dilip K   the government wants to conduct simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls across the length and breadth of the country, but asked how it would undertake such a massive exercise if it cannot even conduct polls for a student's council. AAP MLA Alka Lamba   and said that malfunctioning EVMs always coincided with the BJP's defeat in any polls. All India Congress Committee joint secretary, Ruchi Gupta alleged, ""NSUI was winning the post of DUSU president and secretary after 6 rounds. Then 6 EVMs started malfunctioning and EC wanted to set those aside. How is it that machines which were working till yesterday during polling are no longer working during counting? Clearly some sabotage to help ABVP."" She claimed that similar circumstances arose in the past as well. ""NSUI had submitted a memo to the Election Commission last year and this year on transparency and integrity of the polls. Last year too after announcing that NSUI won (ahead) on 3 seats, we magically lost JS (joint secretary's seat). In Baroda too, after winning both seats, we suddenly lost 1. What is victory without credibility?"" Gupta asked. In the early rounds of counting, reports said that NSUI's Sunny Chhillar was in the lead for the president's post and was trailed by ABVP's Ankiv Baisova. Shakti Singh of the ABVP was ahead in race for the post of vice president, while Aakash Chaudhary, of the NSUI, surged ahead of ABVP's Sudhir Dedha after his initial lead for the post of secretary. Jyoti Chaudhary of the ABVP was leading for the post of joint secretary, according to the last update that had come in before counting was suspended.",2018-09-13,"AAP,ABVP,AISA,AISA-CYSS,Akhil Bharatiya Vidayarthi Parishad,ARSD,Congress,CYSS,Delhi University,Delhi University Election,DU,DU Election,DU Elections,DU Polls,DU President Election Result 2018,DUSU Election,DUSU Election 2018,Dusu Election Result,DUSU Election Results,DUSU Elections,DUSU Polls,DUSU Result,Election Result,EVM Malfunction,EVM Tampering,EVMs,NewsTracker,NSUI,Students' Body,Students' Union,Zakir Hussain College",DUSU elections results 2018: NSUI alleges rigging after EVMs report glitches; counting resumes after 4-hour gap,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/dusu-elections-results-2018-nsui-alleges-rigging-as-counting-suspended-over-glitch-in-evms-5176871.html,firstpost,-1,0

In a live video conference with BJP   from five Lok Sabha seats — Jaipur, Nawada, Ghaziabad, Hazaribagh, and Arunachal West — the prime minister said, “There will always be people who are scared of good work, who are so consumed with their own greed. They should know that the BJP is not just sloganeering. We show results for the things that we promise.” He added that the Congress' goal is the welfare of the Gandhi family, while the BJP's is the welfare of the nation. “At times, I have a sense of condolence for the many old cadres of Congress who have struggled, worked on the ground. Their struggle is benefitting only one family. Many talented individuals have had to sacrifice their work to ensure the growth of one family,” Modi was quoted as saying by  . Responding to comments about the threat of the united Opposition camp, Modi said: ""The united Opposition is not a strong union, it is just an attempt to hide their faults and flaws. The Congress is just looking to stay alive, and these other parties are just a support system to save them from the ICU.""

Press Trust of India," BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday termed as ""motivated"" the Congress' demand of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's resignation over his meeting with Vijay Mallya, saying it is a strategy to deflect attention from the UPA government's ""cronyism and favouritism"". The defence minister told   that a brief conversation which Mallya had with Jaitley in a corridor of Parliament is being ""played up"" and asserted that responses to the issue have ""reinforced"" the fact it was not a conversation of any merit. Jaitley, she noted, had already explained as to how Mallya misused his privilege as a Member of Parliament to speak to him. To a question about Congress MP PL Punia's claim that he had seen Jaitley sitting with Mallya in Parliament's Central Hall and there would be CCTV footage to corroborate it, Sitharaman shot back, asking if the footage would also have audio recording. ""It already seems a very motivated allegation,"" she said of the Congress' charge against Jaitley. Hitting out at the Congress, she said letters were written to the Reserve Bank of India and State Bank of India during the UPA's rule to help Mallya. ""They are in tour face. How favouritism naming that one company has been made...Whose period made it sick? Whose period had favouritism and cronyism entering in to suggest to the central bank and written instructions given to banks to lend to this defaulter,"" she asked. Looking at the strategy with which Congress would want to deflect it, she asked wryly if that ""minutes' conversation"" helped him to go away or all the lending happened (during the UPA rule) because of it. Multiple loans were given to bogus accounts which did not have credit worthiness, she said. The BJP leader said the Modi government had brought in a law through which defaulters' property can be confiscated. The UPA government passed some laws but never made rules, she said. Mallya had Wednesday claimed in London that he had met the finance minister before leaving for the UK, drawing a rebuttal from Jaitley who said he never gave him any appointment but the businessman used his privilege as an MP to accost him in Parliament. Immediately after Jaitley's sharp rebuttal Wednesday, Mallya appeared to tone down the seriousness of his comments, saying it was ""not fair"" to create a controversy over this issue as it was not a ""formal meeting"" and he only ""happened to meet"" the finance minister.",2018-09-13,"Arun Jaitley,BJP,Congress,Defence Minister,Finance Minister,Nirmala Sitharaman,Politics,TheySaidIt,Vijay Mallya","Vijay Mallya-Arun Jaitley row: Congress' charge against finance minister motivated, says Nirmala Sitharaman",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vijay-mallya-arun-jaitley-row-congress-charge-against-finance-minister-motivated-says-nirmala-sitharaman-5179461.html,firstpost,-1,0
Sanjay Singh,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s   to bring ""proof” into the public domain to conclude that finance minister Arun Jaitley “colluded"" with Vijay Mallya is interesting. The “proof” for Rahul was the statement of Panna Lal Punia, his confidant and a Congress Rajya Sabha MP. Punia claimed that on 1 March 2016, a day before Mallya fled, he with “his own eyes” saw the erstwhile liquor baron and promoter of Kingfisher Airlines and Arun Jaitley chatting “very intimately” in the central hall of Parliament, first standing in a corner and then seated on a bench. Rahul took this claim to be the final proof in the matter, and came to the conclusion that this was an “open and shut” case. He demanded that Jaitley must immediately resign. A few questions arise out of Rahul’s accusations that the Narendra Modi-led government  . Before going into other details, one should understand the kind of place that the central hall of Parliament is. This is where the president addresses both Houses of Parliament at the beginning of the year. Visiting foreign dignitaries are invited to speak to parliamentarians here. Further, other important parliamentary functions — such as the roll out of GST, which happened at midnight on 30 June, 2017 — are held at this hall. For the rest of the year, when Parliament is in session, MPs of the two Houses, including ministers, and senior accredited journalists, sit there during leisure and informally interact over tea. The hall is an open house where people walk in and out. At any given point in the day, there are over 50 people present there. In such a scenario, Punia couldn’t have been the only witness to the extended meeting between Mallya and Jaitley in the central hall. There would have been a whole lot of other MPs and mediapersons present there. It is a pertinent question as to how nobody other than Puniya made this charge, or ever claimed to have witnessed this conversation between Jaitley and Mallya. Puniya could not have been a chance witness. Punia now claims that he had been speaking about this conversation since 3 March, 2016. Did he not inform his party leadership, Rahul Gandhi in particular, in the last two-and-a-half-years about having seen this? If he did, then did Rahul Gandhi and the rest of the Congress leadership not consider his claim to be serious enough to be presented as ""proof"" at a press conference? Rahul, while alleging collusion between the Modi government and Mallya, conveniently forgot the way in which the Manmohan Singh government — controlled by him and his mother Sonia Gandhi — extended undue favors to Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines. A series of correspondences brings this aspect to light. For instance, on one occasion, a “relieved” and “pleased” Mallya had thanked Singh for “meeting” him and “responding positively” to his demands. On another occasion, Mallya met with Singh's principal secretary TKA Nair, and the latter spoke to concerned persons in the ministry, directing them to sort things out. On yet another occasion, Mallya had written to his colleague and made a reference to P Chidambaram speaking with a senior State Bank of India (SBI) official about a fresh loan to be granted to Kingfisher Airlines. But the most damning fact is a series of correspondences between the Reserve Bank of India and State Bank of India. In one such correspondence, the RBI overruled the SBI and advised it not to downgrade Kingfisher's status in the books and re-structure loans to bail the airline out. The former asked the SBI to treat this as an exception, not to be used as a precedent for anyone else. The Congress, surely, will have a difficult time explaining its position on these aspects. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently spoken of top Congress leaders during the UPA regime engaging in an unofficial “dial-a-loan” system. Rahul, however, now believes that in Punia’s statement, he has found the ultimate proof to indict the Modi government in the Mallya case. He is using Mallya’s statement given in London on Wednesday as another proof. Mallya had said, “I happened to meet Jaitley in Parliament. I told him that I was leaving for London and want to settle with banks, and (asked if he would) facilitate discussions. I did not have any formal meeting scheduled with him”. To a question as to what was Jaitley's response, Mallya said “nothing”. Jaitley was quick to  . He said “The statement is factually false in as much as it does not reflect truth. Since 2014, I have never given him any appointment to meet me and the question of his having met me does not arise. However, since he was a member of the Rajya Sabha… he misused that privilege on one occasion while I was walking out of the House to go to my room.

Press Trust of India,"Amid bickering in the Congress in Karnataka casting a cloud on its coalition government with the JDS, BJP chief Amit Shah has asked the saffron party state unit ""not to create any confusion"" and instead stick to playing the role of the Opposition sincerely. Rejecting charges by Congress leaders that the BJP was trying to topple the coalition government, the party's Karnataka unit chief BS Yeddyurappa said ""there is no need to doubt our motives."" BJP MLAs have been instructed not to give statements on the current political developments pertaining to turmoil in the Congress, he said. ""BJP national president Amit Shah, with whom I spoke today(Thursday), has instructed us not to create any confusion. We should not give any statements about the political developments taking place in the state. Instead, we should stick to playing the role of Opposition sincerely,"" Yeddyurappa added. Shah's advice to the party unit comes amid allegations that BJP was trying to take advantage of the internal tussle in the Congress and poach on its MLAs to unseat the government. Some senior  Congress leaders have blamed the BJP for the recent discontent in their party. The Jarkiholi brothers — municipal administration minister Ramesh and his MLA brother Satish —are locked in a turf war with another minister DK Shivakumar, casting a shadow over the coalition government. The siblings are upset over Shivakumar allegedly trying to challenge their supremacy in Belagavi 
district through MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar. The tussle has spilled into the open with the brothers assertion about the support of eight MLAs and that they were in touch with the BJP fuelling speculation about the stability of the HD Kumaraswamy government. The brothers, whose dissident activities have caused trouble to the three-month old Congress-JDS coalition, have camped in Bengaluru meeting senior party leaders. Asked about the flurry of activities at his residence since Thursday morning with BJP MLAs making a beeline, Yeddyurappa clarified that the legislators came only to greet him on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Some senior Congress leaders have accused the BJP of trying to poach on their MLAs to come to power. They have reportedly warned BJP that they would not keep quiet if BJP tried to destabilise the government. When asked about a Congress leader claiming that at least 10 BJP MLAs were in touch with them, Yeddyurappa said, ""Why just 10 MLAs? Let them be in touch with all the 104 MLAs.""",2018-09-13,"Amit Shah,BJP,BS Yeddyurappa,Congress,DK Shivakumar,HD Kumaraswamy,Karnataka,NewsTracker",Amit Shah tells Karnataka BJP to 'sincerely' play role of Opposition as Congress infighting casts cloud on coalition govt,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/amit-shah-tells-karnataka-bjp-to-sincerely-play-role-of-opposition-as-congress-infighting-casts-cloud-on-coalition-govt-5179911.html,firstpost,-1,0
Manmohan Vaidya,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s feeble attempt to draw equivalence between the   caused astonishment in those familiar with the RSS and people who hold a national perspective. Alternatively, those professing a communist and Maoist ideology, and practitioners of opportunistic politics were predictably elated. Neither of these responses are unanticipated. However, it must not be assumed that the Congress president lacks awareness about the violence that Islamist terrorists inflict on the civilised world. Neither does this mean that he is unaware of the social work that the RSS carries out through its affiliated organisations, not to mention the growing appeal and support the Sangh receives from society. But then, why would he say such a thing? His political advisers have succeeded in convincing him that criticising the RSS will yield political dividends, and that baseless and provocative statements will compensate for the lack of ground work that is required to lift the grand old party out of its political misfortunes. Hence, he has been schooled to render these statements in a dramatic style without paying any attention to their veracity. When one such statement was legally challenged by a swayamsevak, the Congress president avoided explaining his position in court. In reality, the Sangh is engaged in the noble work of connecting and binding Bharatiya society with the everlasting thread of spirituality and the integral and holistic Bharatiya view of life. To equate this inclusive view of life with the Muslim Brotherhood is an affront to our great civilisational heritage and history. If one was to view the Islamist ideology in practice, the word “brotherhood” itself is inappropriate. In fact, the Muslim Brotherhood, which he chose to cite as an example, views not only the non-Muslims as outsiders, but even Muslims outside the Salafi Sunni fold as outside their ideological commune, and not Muslim. 11 September, 2018 will be the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekanand’s Chicago address in the parliament of world religions. In that historic address, he presented to a world audience the inclusive worldview of Hindu culture. This was not merely an exercise in intellectualism, but one where the strings of the heart were playing a unique tune for an audience unfamiliar with the Hindu view of life but responsive to the music in those sincere words. Swami Vivekananda began his address with “My American Brothers and Sisters…”, an endearment which was received with a standing ovation that lasted a few minutes. In that speech, Swami Vivekananda said, “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation.” “Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilisation and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now.” Dr Ambedkar has also written about the Islamic view of the world. In his book “ ” he says, “Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity.” Muslim Brotherhood wants to bring the Shariat State everywhere, whereas the Sangh stands for a Hindu Rashtra that is based on the ideal of spreading universal acceptance, as propagated by Swami Vivekananda. How can the fundamentalist Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood be equated with the universal brotherhood of Swami Vivekananda. And furthermore, why does Rahul Gandhi feel compelled to speak ill of an organisation that follows the precepts of universal brotherhood and is focused on organising the entire society? A senior columnist once said to me a few years ago, that the Congress has been reduced to a party desperately trying to come to power by any means and is outsourcing its intellectual activity to the communists. Ever since the Congress has carried out this outsourcing to the comrades, it has allied itself with intolerance and has opposed national views and activities. Before independence, the Congress was an open platform, amongst its members were Hindu Mahasabhaites, supporters of revolutionaries, those with radical approach ( ) and also those having a moderate approach ( ). There was space for everyone. However when this platform started taking the shape of a political party, it went from being a large tent of ideas to an organisation alienating and excluding those having different views. It was, however, a gradual progression. Even after independence, there was space for diverse viewpoints; if Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was an staunch critic of the RSS, Sardar Patel invited   to join the Congress party. In 1962, during the India- China war, Nehru, once a critic of the RSS, was so impressed by the selfless service of the Sangh that he invited the RSS to participate in the Republic Day parade. And even though it was very short notice, as many as 3,000 swayamsevaks participated with pride in the parade. During the 1965 Pakistan invasion, Lal Bahadur Shastri called for a meeting with prominent leaders, including the second RSS chief Guruji Gowalkar, going so far as to arrange his immediate transport to the national capital. During this meeting, a communist leader repeatedly asked Shastri, ""What was your army doing when India was invaded?"" Agitated by this stance, especially at such a critical time, Guruji Gowalkar intervened and asked the gentleman why he couldn’t say, “our army”? He asked him if he belonged to some other country. Setting politics aside, this tradition of a dialogue ( ) continued till the 1970s. Subsequently, the influence of the communist ideology started gaining traction in the Congress and the intolerance and “otherness” so closely linked with Stalinist ideals began rearing its ugly head. Confrontational language and an ""us vs them"" discourse started dominating. Apart from the BJP, most political parties reflect communist influence in their intellectual cell in varying degrees. Hence, we find that for short-sighted political gains, there is a tendency to side with attempts (inspired by leftist ideology) of breaking or weakening the unity of the people of the country, and at the same time opposing national ideas and forces. This enervating influence over the past few decades has left the Congress in a strange condition, almost as if its body is but a shell that is now occupied by a Maoist soul. This is not merely an observation, but is borne out by the displays of support the Congress routinely expresses for Maoist protests. It is obvious that the authors who wrote articles in support of the above-mentioned statement of the Congress president seem to have links with the Left ideology. Is it not alarming that Congress leaders stand in solidarity with those who raised slogans of “ ”, “ ” or “ ”? Afzal Guru was the mastermind behind the terrorist attack on the Parliament, the temple of democracy; a person who was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court during the UPA regime. When the Congress supports those who instigate caste violence, undermining and violating the Constitution, one is compelled to feel that the Maoist soul guides their action, using the Congress' identity as a cover. The infiltration of disruptive urban Maoists into mainstream life and their influence has only recently come to light. When a mainstream party like the Congress, which has held power for so many years, supports their destructive designs, it is not an occasion to be surprised, but to be saddened. Despite ideological differences, it is important to concede that the Congress of the past never spoke in the terms used by their current leaders or aligned with disruptive forces that undermined the country and national interest. It is deeply worrying to see the oldest political party in the country, one that enjoys support across the country, stand with such anti-national elements. As a result, the Congress' support base is being eroded. Swami Vivekananda had crossed the oceans to plant the flag of Bharatiya civilisational and cultural values in a foreign land. Today, a politician from the same country travels abroad and equates the Indian cultural ethos with the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an insult to Bharatiya civilisational values and culture. In a democracy, it is expected that there will be differences in opinion and ideologies. However, it is imperative to rise above these differences for the good of the nation. It is only when this unity supersedes politics will the country find solutions to the problems that ail us and move towards realising the Bharat that Swami Vivekananda presented to the world all those years ago.",2018-09-13,"BJP,Chicago,Congress,InMyOpinion,Jawaharlal Nehru,Maoists,Rahul Gandhi,RSS,Swami Vivekananda,Urban Maoists","Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's RSS-Muslim Brotherhood analogy insults country's heritage, shows how party has regressed",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-chief-rahul-gandhis-rss-muslim-brotherhood-analogy-insults-countrys-heritage-shows-how-party-has-regressed-5179731.html,firstpost,-1,0

Press Trust of India,"The TRS is facing rumblings of discontent after several aspirants were denied tickets to contest the upcoming Assembly elections in Telangana, with some of them coming out openly against the party leadership. The election season is also witnessing leaders eyeing greener pastures shifting loyalties. TRS boss and caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao had last week released a list of 105 candidates for the state's 119 seats immediately after the dissolution of the Assembly. Those left out were as quick to express their displeasure as Rao was with the list. Konda Surekha, a four-time MLA and former minister, who was denied nomination, fulminated against the party leadership, accusing it of perpetuating ""family politics"".

Press Trust of India," Allegations flew thick and fast on Thursday between the Congress and the BJP over the Vijay Mallya affair — Rahul Gandhi accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of lying to hide the ""free passage"" he allegedly gave to the defaulter aviation tycoon to flee to London, while the ruling party counter-claimed the Gandhi family tried to salvage the sinking Kingfisher Airlines with a ""sweet deal"". At a hurriedly-called press conference, Rahul presented what   in the form of party leader PL Punia, who claimed to have seen Arun Jaitley having ""an elaborate 15-20 minute meeting"" with Mallya on 1 March, 2016, a day before the businessman left India. For its part, the BJP lined up party big guns with counter-allegations about how Mallya was helped by the UPA regime to keep his debt-ridden aviation venture afloat. ""Vijay Mallya was given free passage out of the country by the finance minister and the finance minister has clearly said the criminal told him that he is going to run away. Well, why did you let him run away? Why did you not stop him because you were colluding with him?"" Rahul alleged and challenged Jaitley to get CCTV footage of 1 March. While the Opposition party demanded immediate resignation of Jaitley and an independent probe into the whole affair, the BJP alleged it was the previous UPA government that gave a ""sweet deal"" to Mallya as if it was the Gandhi family that proxy-owned the airline. Kingfisher ultimately had to be grounded in October 2012 under a burden of over Rs 9,000 crore of unpaid loans and several other liabilities including defaults on employee salaries and other payments. In the political war of words, maverick BJP leader Subramanian Swamy also got into fray. He raised questions on how the lookout notice against the absconding businessman got diluted that eventually allowed him to flee the country. Adding further fodder to the Opposition's charges, former attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi told   it was a ""big coincidence"" that Mallya left India on the same day a consortium of banks moved to recover their unpaid debt and it was possible that someone could have ""tipped him off"". The 62-year-old Mallya — who was once listed on Forbes' list of billionaires and was famously known as 'King of Good Times' owing to his flashy lifestyle — said in London on Wednesday he was not ""tipped off"" by anyone and he had  in Parliament, a statement seen as a dilution from his earlier ""innocent statement"" that he had met the finance minister before leaving India and had told him about his settlement offer for banks. Seeking to shift the blame, the BJP leaders including top Union ministers alleged many Congress leaders had tried to save Mallya and his sinking business empire. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Congress was raking up the issue to deflect attention from the UPA government's ""cronyism and favouritism"" and the demand for Jaitley's resignation over a ""brief conversation"" with Mallya was motivated. Jaitley has rebutted Mallya's claim as ""factually false"" saying he never had any structured meeting with him and it was a brief conversation which Mallya forced on him by misusing his privileges as a Rajya Sabha member at that time. Joining BJP's counter-offensive, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asked whether Rahul and Mallya were ""working in tandem"" and claimed the liquor baron had allegedly benefitted from bank facilities during the UPA government. Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said Mallya was a criminal and his words could not be taken seriously and it was Rahul who should resign from all posts. He alleged banks were pressured by the UPA regime to sanction loans to Mallya due to the Gandhi family's ""relations"" with him. Joining the chorus, activist Shehzad Poonawalla, who often supports the ruling party in thrashing the Congress, claimed Rahul had met Punjab National Bank fraud-accused Nirav Modi at a plush hotel in the national capital in 2013, a charge denied by the opposition party. Rahul, who had on Wednesday night also sought Jaitley's resignation after Mallya dropped his bombshell of the sensational claim, alleged the finance minister had ""colluded with the criminal"" and allowed him to escape from the country. ""Jaitley is lying, the government is lying on Rafale and the government is lying on Vijay Mallya. A meeting was held with Jaitley and Mallya. The logistics of Mallya leaving the country were discussed in that meeting,"" Rahul told reporters. ""The criminal had told him, 'I am going to run away to London'. The finance minister has accepted publicly that he has been told by a criminal that he is going to run away and the finance minister has not done anything, has not informed the CBI, and has not informed the ED. What does that mean? It means, he is colluding with the criminal. Straightforward,"" Rahul said. The BJP hit back with equal ferocity, with its spokesperson Sambit Patra, flashing a bunch of documents at a press conference and telling reporters there is a series of letters between the RBI and main lender SBI that show ""how the previous dispensation under Sonia Gandhi was biased, partial and kept all norms and regulations at bay to give a sweet deal to Kingfisher.""

Former MP Jaipal Reddy on Friday also slammed the government and said that the government ""let Mallya flee the country"".  the change in a 2015 lookout circular against ex-liquor baron Mallya from ""detain"" to merely informing about his movements was an ""error"" in judgement because he had been cooperating in the probe and there was no warrant against him. CBI sources said that when the first LoC was issued on 12 October, 2015, Mallya was already abroad. Upon his return, the agency was asked by the Bureau of Immigration (BoI), if Mallya should be detained as sought in the LoC. The CBI replied that there was no need to arrest or detain him as he was a sitting MP and there was no warrant against him. The agency said that since the probe was in an initial stage and documents were being collected from the IDBI in the Rs 900 crore loan default case, the CBI issued a fresh LoC against Mallya in the last week of November 2015 asking airport authorities across the country to ""inform"" it about Mallya's movements, thus replacing its previous circular which had sought detention of the businessman if he attempted to leave the country.

Press Trust of India,"Congress and NCP leaders in Maharashtra began their preliminary seat-sharing talks on Tuesday for the Lok Sabha and state Assembly polls scheduled for 2019. The move is aimed at forging a ""grand alliance"" of ""secular"" parties to take on the BJP and the Shiv Sena, the Congress said. The two parties, which ruled Maharashtra for 15 years from 1999, were defeated in the 2014 Assembly elections by the BJP after they parted ways ahead of the polls. Talking to reporters after the meeting, state Congress president Ashok Chavan said leaders of the two parties met to discuss poll preparations to take on the BJP and the Shiv Sena and said it was a good start. ""It was a good start. Both the parties unanimously decided to have a grand alliance of secular parties. Our main fight is with the BJP and the Shiv Sena, and we have to avoid division of secular votes,"" the former chief minister said. ""We decided to take the initiative to speak to leaders of other like-minded parties (for the grand alliance). Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil will speak to the leaders (of like-minded parties),"" he said. The two parties will meet again later this week, Chavan said. ""We will have a meeting in two to three days. There will be clarity in a week's time about the stand of these like-minded parties. But the Congress and the NCP have decided to take the lead to speak to them,"" he said. Chavan said the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were very crucial to the state and the country. ""We have decided to contest the polls together to avoid any division of votes,"" he said. Besides Chavan and Vikhe-Patil, others Congress members at the meeting were former Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde, former state unit chief Manikrao Thakre, Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam, deputy party leader in the Assembly Vijay Waddetiwar and former minister Mohammed Arif Naseem Khan. State NCP president Jayant Patil, former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Mumbai NCP president Sachin Ahir, senior leaders Anil Deshmukh, Shashikant Shinde, Jitendra Awhad, Sunil Tatkare and Chhagan Bhujbal represented the NCP. Both the Congress and the NCP have already started their election preparations separately. The NCP has covered the state with its ""Halla Bol yatra"", while the Congress launched its mass contact programme from western Maharashtra in September. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the NCP had bagged four seats, while the Congress got only two out of the total 48 seats in Maharashtra. In the Assembly polls held in October 2014, the Congress won 42 and NCP 41 out of the total 288 seats.",2018-09-11,"BJP,Congress,Lok Sabha Election,Maharashtra,Maharashtra Assembly Election 2019,NCP,NewsTracker,Shiv Sena","Maharashtra Congress, NCP begin seat-sharing talks for 2019 polls, Ashok Chavan calls it 'good start'",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/maharashtra-congress-ncp-begin-seat-sharing-talks-for-2019-polls-ashok-chavan-calls-it-good-start-5164701.html,firstpost,-1,0
FP Staff,"Lakhs of ASHA (accredited social health activists) and anganwadi workers spread across in rural areas of the country had so far lived an unsung life. This all-woman workforce that is engaged in the critical task of rural child healthcare, prenatal care and nutrition programmes for pregnant women in the hinterland has hardly ever received the recognition it deserves. Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly engaged with over 28 lakh women workers via a video bridge interaction and announced an honorarium for them. Those receiving Rs 3,000 so far, would now receive Rs 4,500. Similarly, those receiving Rs 2,200, would now get Rs 3,500. The honorarium for anganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,250. They will also be provided free insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana and other routine incentives given to them by the Union government will also be doubled. Then there are some performance-based incentives. Besides the monetary benefits, the prime minister showered praise on their work at the grassroots — their role in combating malnourishment for mothers and newborn children. Modi linked boys and girls from poorer sections of society winning medals in the recently concluded Asian Games with the efforts of anganwadi and ASHA workers in rural areas. While praising their role and enhancing their remuneration, Modi also entrusted them with additional responsibilities. This is an election year as five states will be going to the polls in next two-and-a-half months and the big bang General Election is due in the next seven months. Thus, the political significance of Modi’s interaction with ASHA, auxiliary nurse midwife and anganwadi workers could not be lost. These workers have penetration in almost every single household, particularly womenfolk around the centres they work. A satisfied group of anganwadi workers could also be potential messengers of Modi government in the hinterland. The number of operational anganwadi centres as on 31 December, 2015 was 13,49,091. The top 10 states in terms of the number of operational centres have been Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh-Telangana (undivided). These states also account for 341 parliamentary seats. The politically critical Uttar Pradesh accounts for around 14 percent of the total operational centres in India. Given the kind of goodwill these women generally have in their respective areas of work, an endorsement of the Modi government may help influence voting pattern of a substantial section of womenfolk and possibly their family members also. It seemed to be a well-crafted strategy on the part of the prime minister to directly engage with over 28 women workers in rural areas through a mobile phone application both on account of governance and also eyeing a political dividend. Hours after Modi finished his interaction with them, the BJP leadership fielded Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani to hold a media briefing at party headquarters in New Delhi. After she was shunted from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting four months ago, she has not been visible at the party’s platforms. Her arrival at the new party headquarters to address a press conference signified two things: Her rehabilitation as one the most feisty speakers on issues that matters most for the party and political importance the leadership attached to Modi’s interaction with Anganwadi workers. She was also fielded to get on to her favourite turf and take on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on the   case. On Monday, the Delhi High Court had dismissed Sonia and Rahul Gandhi’s plea against the income tax department’s decision to re-open their tax assessment for year 2011-12 relating to Associated Journals, publishers of  . The court had also rejected plea by Congress leaders that media be restrained from publishing reports on this count. Irani asserted while Modi is trying to reach poor sections of society as he did through interaction with Anganwadi workers on Tuesday, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were only concerned about accumulating money for their own family.",2018-09-12,"Anganwadi Workers,ASHA Workers,Healthcare,Politics,PoliticsDecoder,Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana,Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana,Women Health","Ahead of 2019 polls, Narendra Modi showers sops on army of anganwadi workers to win over rural India",https://www.firstpost.com/politics/ahead-of-2019-polls-narendra-modi-showers-sops-on-army-of-anganwadi-workers-to-win-over-rural-india-5164061.html,firstpost,-1,0
Press Trust of India," Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah is all set to sound the poll bugle for the ensuing Assembly elections in Telangana with a public meeting at Mahabubnagar on Saturday, a party leader said Friday. During his day-long visit, Shah would pray at the temple of Goddess Mahankali in the old city of Hyderabad in the afternoon before proceeding to Mahabubnagar, state BJP president K Laxman told reporters on Friday. After the public meeting, he would meet the party's state office-bearers and district unit presidents at Kothur in the evening to discuss the strategy for the elections, before returning to Delhi. Laxman slammed the proposed ""unholy alliances"" between Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Communist Party of India (CPI) on one side and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and ""communal"" All India All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) on the other. The parties are trying to do ""Karnataka-type politics"" in Telangana, he alleged. The reported comments of AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi that his party can stake claim to chief ministership, though it may not have majority strength post-elections, similar to HD Kumaraswamy becoming the chief minister in Karnataka, should not be taken lightly, Laxman claimed. Congress, TRS, TDP and the communists have helped AIMIM grow by joining hands with it in the past and ""people need to be alert,"" he said. ""MIM, which is thought to be a rope, is going to be a noose,"" he added. The TRS government has not celebrated 'Telangana Liberation Day' on 17 September (when erstwhile Nizam state merged with the Indian Union in 1948) as part of implementing AIMIM's agenda, the BJP leader charged. BJP is the only strong alternative to these parties and Shah would make it clear, he said. BJP would contest all the 119 Assembly segments in the state on its own, Laxman said. Telangana would be the gateway to the south to BJP after Karnataka and Union ministers and other leaders would visit the state for campaigning, he said. His party would go to the people urging them to elect a BJP government as they had given opportunity to all the parties, he said.

Press Trust of India," The Congress will construct ""Ram Path"" (a mythical route taken by Lord Ram during his 14-year exile) stretching up to the borders of Madhya Pradesh if voted to power, senior party leader Digvijaya Singh said Tuesday. He said the Congress would also construct the ""Narmada Parikrama Path"". Assembly elections are due in Madhya Pradesh later in 2018. The Congress has been out of power in the central state since 2003. ""The ruling BJP had announced to develop the 'Ram Path' but never kept its promise. But, we are thinking to construct the 'Ram Path' up to the borders of the state. The 'Narmada Parikrama Path' would also be constructed,"" Singh told a press conference in Bhopal. Narmada Parikrama is a walk along the banks of the river Narmada which covers a distance of 3,300 kilometres. Responding to a query whether the Congress is adopting ""soft Hindutva"", the former chief minister said there was nothing like soft or hard Hindutva. ""Hindutva has nothing to do with the religion,"" he said. When asked if the Congress was emulating the BJP by promising development of the 'Ram Path' and setting up cow shelters in the state, Singh replied in negative. The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government had announced on on 1 October, 2007 that it would track the 'Ram Gaman Path' or the route that Lord Ram had taken in the 11 out of 14 years of his exile he had spent in the forests of state through the districts of Satna, Panna, Shahdol, Jabalpur and Vidisha. Singh said the so-called worshippers of the cow are only interested in collecting funds. ""During the ersthile rule of the Congress, 'gaushalas' were constructed in Madhya Pradesh. Nobody should have objections if the Congress talks about setting up 'gaushalas' in every Panchayat (to avoid the problems of stray cattle),"" he said. Singh said he never harboured animosity against the BJP or even the RSS. ""There may be political rivalry, but no acrimony,"" he said. The Congress leader dared Chouhan to prove a single instance of corruption during his 10-year rule as the chief minister from 1993-2003. ""The BJP has failed to prove even a single corruption charge in the last 15 years. Why to talk about proving, they even could not level a charge against me. But, I am saying that the family of Shivraj Singh Chouhan is involved in Vyapam scam and illegal sand mining,"" he alleged. Singh accused the BJP of raising issues that may create social tension. Replying to a query, Singh said, ""Neither Hindus nor Sanatan dharma is in danger. Mughals had ruled this country for 500 years and Christians for 150 years, but Sanatan dharma continued to exist. Some people are misleading common people to serve their political interests"". Singh said he would soon serve a legal notice to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. ""Shivraj had termed me anti-national, but no case has been registered against me so far. Now, they (BJP) are saying that I have relations with Naxals.

Indo-Asian News Service," The Congress on Tuesday accused the Modi government of leaving ""gaping holes"" in the process of repatriation of PNB bank fraud accused Mehul Choksi and giving him a ""clean chit"" that enabled him to escape from the country early in 2018. Congress communications in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala referred to Choksi's remarks in a video interview in which he has denied allegations of any wrongdoing and said he had received an email from the passport office on 16 February that his passport has been suspended. ""It is intriguing that Modi government allowed passport of Choksi to remain valid till 16 February , helping him escape on 4 January,"" Surjewala told reporters. He referred to the written reply given in Parliament to a question by party leader Kapil Sibal. ""Shocking details based on a parliamentary reply of 24 July as also details from Antigua's Citizenship By Investment Unit (CIU) have lifted the cover from the sins committed by every organ of the Modi government — Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) — that facilitated and gave a ‘clean chit' to Choksi. It also conclusively exposes the barrage of lies that ministers in the Modi government were trying to plant in the mainstream media,"" Surjewala said. He said the PMO has admitted in the reply that the first report of action against Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi was given to PMO by the finance department on 1 March. He said Nirav Modi, also accused in the PNB bank fraud case, had escaped from the country on 1 January. ""Complicity of PMO and the finance ministry in the escape of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi is thus writ large. Why did PMO wait till 1 March to get a report on fraud by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi? Does it not prove their complicity in the matter?"" he asked. Surjewala alleged that the PMO, Maharashtra and Gujarat governments and several other agencies ""deliberately ignored evidence of fraud and multiple complaints"" against Choksi and another bank fraud accused Nirav Modi since 7 May, 2015. Surjewala said a complaint was filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on 7 May, 2015 and copies were sent to PMO, Enforcement Directorate, Serious Fraud Investigation Office and SEBI. A similar complaint, he said, was filed with Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mumbai. Surjewala said an FIR was filed in Ahmedabad Economic Offences Wing against Choksi and and the matter went to Gujarat High Court in which the state government was a party. He said an affidavit was filed in the court on 20 July, 2016 pointing out that Choksi and others owed Rs.9,872 crore to banks and were likely to escape from India. Surjewala said the press statement by CIU reveals how clean chit was given for Choksi's citizenship of Antigua in May 2017. ""The clearance certified that there was ‘no adverse information' against Choksi. The CIU also states that SEBI had also given ‘clean chit certificate' to Choksi,"" he said. Surjewala said Interpol gave clearance to Choksi as CBI and Enforcement Directorate failed to get a warrant issued against him or provide the requisite evidence.

The BJP's victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will pave the way for the party's rule for the next 50 years.” He claimed the Congress has tried to create a state of confusion in the country and referred to lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq in Dadri over alleged cow slaughter and the 2015 protest in which a group of writers returned their awards. “During elections, issues like Akhlaq or 'award  ' come up,” he said. “The BJP had won elections when the Akhlaq issue and award wapsi happened and the party will win this time too even if they (Congress) bring up some other issue. The Modi government or the Raje government has done nothing that you need to bow your head,” he said.

He said the workers should think only about the party symbol 'lotus' and Bharat Mata when they campaign. Shah added that the ' ', or the grand alliance, that the Opposition is talking about will have no impact except a little influence in Uttar Pradesh.

Go to the public and highlight the work done by the Modi and the Raje governments,” he said, adding that no one can defeat the BJP in Rajasthan. Targeting Congress, the BJP president said the party should first make clear who is its leader and what are its policies and programmes. “Rahul   has the right to dream but he will wake up on the day of counting,” he said.

Press Trust of India," The Congress plans to go in for a broad based alliance in the Telangana Assembly polls in line with its efforts to forge opposition unity at the national level, a senior party leader has said. The party was trying to unite the opposition in the state and was in contact with all parties, including CPI, Kondaram (of TJS) and TDP, AICC in charge of Congress affairs in Telangana RC Khuntia said. ""We are not averse to having an alliance with TDP,"" he told  . Citing the example of Karnataka, where Congress allowed JD(S) to take the chief minister's post despite having more number of seats,he said the idea in Telangana was in line with it's efforts at the national level to unite the opposition. The proposal was however at a preliminary stage and seat-sharing had not yet been discussed, Khuntia said. ""This is only the preliminary stage. We have not discussed seat sharing. But we are formulating a broad-based alliance, including the TDP also, on the basis of the Common Minimum Programme,"" he said. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy has already urged all political parties, including TDP and non-political forces, to join hands with Congress to 'end the misrule' of TRS in the state. ""There can only be TRS and anti-TRS blocks (other BJP) in the state,"" Khuntia claimed. On how Congress would justify an alliance with TDP,which has always been opposed to it, he said Congress does not harbour any bitter feelings towards the TDP. He said the TDP opposed the NDA government, as seen in the no-confidence motion, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman election and the 'Bharat Bandh' against the fuel price hike, he said. The Congress aimed at defeating the 'communal forces' and wanted to take along opposition parties, he said. The party would highlight the 'failure' of TRS to implement its promises, including increase in reservations for minorities and STs and double bedroom housing for the poor, with emphasis on the door-to-door campaign, he said.

Press Trust of India," A Congress MLA was suspended from Haryana Assembly on Tuesday for one year after the legislator and the Leader of Opposition, Abhay Singh Chautala, hurled abuses and charged at each other with a shoe in their hand, prompting the Speaker to summon marshals. A resolution to suspend Karan Singh Dalal, which was supported by main opposition INLD, was moved by finance minister Capt Abhimanyu over alleged use of derogatory language and misconduct by the Congress MLA and passed by voice vote in the House. During the first half of the day's proceedings, the firebrand Congress MLA from Palwal had a heated exchange with Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Chautala and both stopped short of exchanging blows. Chautala held a shoe in his hand as he advanced aggressively towards Dalal who too took out his shoe as both hurled abuses at each other. The Speaker summoned House marshals to form a human chain around the two legislators. Congress MLAs including Hooda held Dalal's hands in a bid to prevent the situation from escalating further. Later, the Assembly was adjourned briefly. The Congress protested against the suspension of its MLA, alleging that the BJP was misusing its majority in the House. Dalal said he would move the court against his suspension and questioned why no action was taken against Chautala. However, during second sitting of the Assembly in the evening, the House passed another resolution to condemn alleged objectionable behaviour and language of both Dalal and Chautala and for not maintaining decorum of the House, inviting objection from Congress and INLD MLAs. Amid the din, the House had to be adjourned briefly for third time over the issue. Earlier, the trouble started when Dalal expressed his unhappiness over a minister's reply to his supplementary questions on the Calling Attention motion over alleged deletion of some ration cards belonging to the poor. The government, in its reply, denied the allegation. But dissatisfied with Minister Karan Dev Kamboj's response, Dalal accused the government of snatching the rights of the poor and used a word which angered the ruling benches. Ministers Anil Vij, OP Dhankar, Manish Grover and Capt Abhimanyu hit back at Dalal, asking him how could he use word which ""brings disrepute for Haryana"". They claimed that Dalal has not only insulted the House, but entire 2.5 crore population of the state, which the Assembly represents. Dhankar slammed Dalal for using ""insulting words for the motherland"". Dalal tried to clarify, saying he had said that government is insulting the poor by snatching their rights. As the ruckus continued, Dalal sought a ruling from deputy speaker Santosh Yadav, who was in the Chair at that time, on whether such a word could be used. He later also sought ruling from Speaker Kanwar Pal when he resumed the Chair. However, amid the din, Yadav adjourned the House for 10 minutes. As the House re-assembled, Dhankar and some other ruling BJP members raised the demand that Dalal be suspended from the House. The Speaker urged both the ruling and opposition MLAs to refrain from using unparliamentary language in the House, telling them otherwise it will be difficult to run Assembly. Capt Abhimanyu said the Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala too should express his views on Dalal's matter. Chautala said ""the kind of language used by Dalal, who is a five-time MLA, was unacceptable"". Seeking an apology from Dalal will not serve the purpose, he said and asked the treasury benches to move a resolution for Dalal's suspension, adding the INLD will support it. Soon, Chautala and Dalal were involved in a slanging match and Speaker Kanwar Pal adjourned the House for 15 minutes. As the House re-assembled once again, Capt Abhimanyu moved the resolution that condemned the use of derogatory word by Dalal for Haryana and his conduct ""unbecoming of a member"" and suspended him from the House for one year. Hooda took strong objection to the resolution, saying the BJP was misusing its majority in the House to suspend opposition MLA without allowing him an opportunity to give a proper explanation. The former chief minister even apologised on Dalal's behalf, but at the same time said that he had never seen such a situation where an opposition MLA was suspended without being given a chance to explain his side. Congress MLAs led by Hooda and CLP leader Kiran Chowdhary sought a review of the decision and asked under what rule Dalal had been suspended for a year. However, Speaker Kanwar Pal told them that the decision was taken by the House. ""The decision of the House is final,"" he told the Congress members. He disallowed a demand of Congress members to allow them to move a motion against the resolution which had been passed. Later, opposition Congress staged a walkout from the Assembly. Later talking to reporters outside the Assembly, Dalal termed his suspension as ""illegal"" and said he would move the court in this regard. Hitting out at Chautala, Dalal said, ""why was he not suspended for taking out a shoe and charging at me"".",2018-09-12,"Abhay Singh Chautala,Capt Abhimanyu,Congress,Deputy Speaker,Harayana,Haryana Assembly,INLD,Karan Singh Dalal,MLA,NewsTracker,Palwal,Santosh Yadav",Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal suspended for 1 year from Haryana Assembly for hurling shoe at INLD leader,https://www.firstpost.com/politics/congress-mla-karan-singh-dalal-suspended-for-1-year-from-haryana-assembly-for-hurling-shoe-at-inld-leader-5166091.html,firstpost,-1,0

Referring to the panchayat polls, Mufti further added that looking at the situation, PDP has decided to ‘stay away from the process’. According to  , the Centre wants to give time to the mainstream parties to review their decision to boycott the elections, a move which is seen as defeating the very purpose of holding the elections.

""I had never given him an appointment, never at my office and never at my residence. Nor have I ever offered to meet him,"" Jaitley told  . Apart from the encounter that Jaitley described in his Facebook post, the finance minister said: ""There is no question of my having ever met him or spoken to him. I even did not receive any paper from him at that time. And therefore, to convey an impression that he met me with an offer of settlement is factually not correct."" After the hearing in the Westminster Magistrates' Court, reporters asked Mallya for details of his meeting with Jaitley. The businessman  : ""I'm afraid this is a controversy created by my friends in the media. I was standing here during lunch and I happened to answer a question on the circumstances under which I flew out. I said that I happened to meet Mr Jaitley in Parliament, and I told him that I was leaving for London, and that I want to settle with the banks."" ""I did not have any formal meetings scheduled with him. I met him often enough in Parliament, in the House and in central hall,"" Mallya said. ""I don't understand what this controversy is all about."" On being asked whether he had met any other BJP leaders, Mallya said: ""Over a period of time, I have met many colleagues in Parliament and expressed to them my desire to settle with the banks. I don't believe I owe you any further details."" ""I can confirm to you that nobody tipped me off. There was no need to run and the allegations are media-created allegations,"" he also said. The Congress was not convinced by Jaitley's response. Before Mallya's clarification came in, party spokesperson   the country wants to know what transpired during the meetings between Mallya and Jaitley. ""The government should now explain how and why he was allowed to leave and what transpired at those meetings. The nation wants to know,"" he said, adding that the government was fully complicit in the ""flight"" of people like Mallya and others from the country. On Jaitley's response to Mallya's remarks, Singhvi was   as saying: ""Phrase used by Mallya today is that 'he met the finance minister'. But 'met the finance minister' doesn't suggest a passing, casual, walking meeting inside the House of Rajya Sabha. I think a more categorical and detailed response must be given. The question remains that how could he have left after everyone knew of debts and NPAs."" Congress leader Anand Sharma said: ""Vijay Mallya has run away after looting money from banks. The government had this information. So when the finance minister gave statements in Parliament on the Vijay Mallya issue, he should have mentioned this meeting with Mallya. Only the finance minister can tell why he didn't tell (anyone) about it."" Party chief Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should ""immediately order an independent probe"", given the ""extremely serious allegations"" Mallya made in London. ""Arun Jaitley should step down as finance minister while this probe is underway. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also criticised the government over this issue.  Former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said the party ""must come clean on its relations with Vijay Mallya"". Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury suggested that there were ""other facts"" that were being hidden now.  ""It's a fact that all of us had known earlier. Whatever denials the government may issue, it confirms that all those who looted public money by taking loans from banks and absconded, not one of them happened to leave the country without knowledge of the government,""   quoted Yechury as saying. The Congress also had its own unique way of hitting out at the government on Twitter. Other Congress leaders also posted tweets against the government.   Leaders of the saffron party came to Jaitley's defence on Twitter and re-shared the finance minister's statement on the controversy.

Press Trust of India,"Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday slammed BJP chief Amit Shah for his statement that the saffron party will be invincible for the next 50 years if it wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Such a statement reflects the BJP's fascist approach, Gehlot said. The BJP does not believe in democracy. It wants to come to power once again to damage and change the Constitution and rule for 50 years, he told reporters in Jaipur. The former Rajasthan chief minister said Shah had inadvertently exposed the thinking of his party and its ideological parent, the RSS. They, Gehlot alleged, want people to give them one more chance so that there is no requirement of the election process. Addressing party workers on Tuesday, Shah had said that the BJP will be invincible for the next 50 years from panchayat to Parliament if it wins the 2019 general elections. Attacking the BJP, Gehlot said those who could not appoint a state party president of their choice owing to pressure from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had no right to comment on the Congress and its president Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader exuded confidence that the party would face no hurdles in winning the upcoming Assembly election in Rajasthan.

Indo-Asian News Service,"Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar is struggling with illness and has lost grip on his allies and government and may use unconstitutional means to dissolve the Assembly, state Congress President Girish Chodankar said in a letter to Governor Mridula Sinha on Wednesday. ""This letter is... to enlighten and caution your Excellency of a possible attempt to dissolve the Assembly on basis of a concocted Cabinet decision which was successfully done by Parrikar in 2002 when there was political uncertainty,"" Chodankar alleged. ""The government led by Parrikar is in minority and is struggling with its allies and intra-party politics and as such he is losing grip over allies and party MLAs and leaders. Further, the administration is on its knees,"" the Congress leader said, adding that the coastal state is virtually in a ""state of emergency"". Parrikar last week returned from the US - the third time in six months - following another round of treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Parrikar has not attended office since his return on 6 September. Chodankar said Parrikar has been ""struggling with health issues"" ever since his return. ""In the present scenario, the chief minister may opt for dissolution of Assembly on the basis of a concocted Cabinet decision, (without even holding a Cabinet meeting or falsely interpolating a recommendation for dissolution) which may be submitted to your excellency,"" Chodankar said.
